          <p>Drake Solomon, who formerly portrayed the Denver Nuggets' mascot Rocky the Mountain Lion, is suing the team's ownership group, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment. The lawsuit alleges disability discrimination and an unlawful severance offer, claiming Solomon was dismissed after undergoing a double hip replacement surgery. Solomon, whose father also performed as the mascot for over three decades, argues the company impeded his return to work and offered an unlawful severance agreement that violated Colorado's Protecting Opportunities and Workers' Rights (POWR) Act. He asserts the experience felt like a betrayal after his family's long-standing loyalty to the franchise.</p>

The substance was found in four separate envelopes on the ninth floor, leading to a hazmat response from the FDNY and an investigation by the FBI. Officials reported that two people were exposed to the powder, but no injuries were confirmed, and they stated that no threat remained to the public. The envelopes are being sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico for further testing as authorities continue to investigate the incident.</p>

          <p>Instagram users are expressing anger and confusion after parent company Meta erroneously suspended numerous accounts, often for alleged breaches of child sexual exploitation policies. Many users, including small business owners and individuals, have lost access to their profiles, cherished photos, and client networks without specific reasons for the bans. Despite acknowledging a problem with Facebook Groups in June, Meta has denied a wider issue, often only reinstating accounts after media inquiries. Critics accuse the company of relying on flawed AI moderation for both bans and appeals, leaving users with little recourse.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological breakthrough that could significantly enhance its naval power. The runway-independent aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of various warships, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. This development could effectively transform nearly any Chinese naval vessel, such as destroyers and frigates, into a small-scale aircraft carrier. According to the project team, the drone's performance, particularly its speed, is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in operation.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about Latin American nations increasingly looking to China for economic partnership, stating that the U.S. economy is outperforming all other countries. His remarks came as Brazil and Beijing work on a multilateral response to tariffs the Trump administration imposed on a wide range of Brazilian exports. Trump asserted that the U.S. is "blowing everyone away, including China," in terms of economic performance. The comments reflect ongoing trade tensions and a shifting geopolitical landscape where some traditional U.S. partners are exploring deeper economic ties with Beijing.</p>

Youngblut is also charged with assaulting two other agents with a deadly weapon. Authorities have linked the shooting to the Zizians, a cult-like group, and stated that the decision reflects a commitment to holding accountable those who attack law enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>As students in Los Angeles return to school, immigrant families report living in a state of fear and uncertainty due to a recent increase in federal immigration enforcement. Undocumented parents express anxiety about being separated from their U.S. citizen children, with some even considering keeping them home from school. In response, the Los Angeles Unified School District has established "safe zones" around 100 schools to monitor for federal activity and protect families. The heightened tensions follow several high-profile enforcement operations in Latino-majority neighborhoods, which officials and community members have criticized as politically motivated intimidation tactics.</p>

          <p>A man from Riverside County, California, has been arrested for allegedly stealing over $100,000 worth of surgical equipment and skin grafts from a local hospital. Authorities say the suspect, Jason Brauner, disguised himself as a hospital employee by wearing scrubs and a surgical mask during three separate thefts in June and July. Stolen medical equipment was later discovered in his vehicle during a traffic stop, and a subsequent search of his home uncovered additional supplies. Investigators have also identified him as a suspect in similar thefts at hospitals in Newport Beach and Loma Linda.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that state Democrats will pursue a plan to redraw congressional district maps, a direct countermeasure to a Republican-led effort in Texas to create more favorable districts for the GOP. Newsom framed the move as a necessary action to "meet fire with fire" and neutralize what he called an attempt by Donald Trump to rig the electoral system. The plan would require a special election in November for voters to approve a new map, which would override the state's independent redistricting commission. This action would only proceed if Texas or another Republican state advances its own mid-decade partisan redistricting.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite facing significant trade headwinds from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to the GDP increase. This expansion occurred even as Japan navigated an uncertain trade environment, ultimately reaching a deal with the U.S. that imposes a 15% blanket tariff on its exports. While the Bank of Japan has upgraded its economic forecast for the fiscal year, it also cautioned that global trade policies could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies.</p>

The sentiment that tipping has become more prevalent is widely viewed as a negative development, which may be linked to broader public concerns about rising prices and the cost of living.

In contrast, Trump is driven by his campaign promise to be a peacemaker, aiming to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, though his approach has been inconsistent.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance was reportedly turned away from The Bull, a pub in Oxfordshire, England, after staff members threatened a walkout if his reservation was accepted. The incident occurred while Vance was in the region for downtime, where his presence has also been met with protest signs from some local residents. This is not the first time Vance has encountered resistance at a restaurant, following a similar incident in Pennsylvania before the election. The pub and its ownership group have not commented on the matter, which highlights political tensions surrounding the Vice President's visit.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is projected to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely to support the growth of artificial intelligence. This expansion, primarily funded by major U.S. tech companies like Google and Microsoft, has raised significant concerns about the immense energy and water consumption required. Experts warn that the increased demand could strain national utilities and potentially drive up consumer energy prices. While the government views data centres as critical national infrastructure, residents and environmental groups are raising objections over the environmental impact and strain on local resources.</p>

          <h2>New AI Technology Aims to Revolutionize Film Dubbing for International Audiences</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed, potentially breaking down barriers for international cinema in markets like the United States. Developed by the company Flawless, the technology manipulates video to make actors' lip movements match the dubbed language, creating a more seamless and authentic viewing experience. The system was recently used on the Swedish sci-fi film "Watch the Skies," enabling a theatrical release in the U.S. that would have otherwise been unlikely. Proponents believe this innovation will allow a wider range of global films to reach new audiences without the distracting quality of traditional dubbing.</p>

As part of the partnership, toy maker Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to help increase girls' access to rugby clubs and coaching.

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns about its long-term financial stability are mounting. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is facing a significant funding shortfall, with its trust funds projected to be depleted by 2034. This could lead to an automatic 23% cut in benefits if Congress does not intervene. The challenges are compounded by an aging population and political debates over potential fixes, such as raising the payroll tax cap or increasing the retirement age, leading to decreased public confidence in the program's future.</p>

He contrasted the current environment with the dot-com bubble, noting that today's market is supported by strong fundamentals in major companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly. While acknowledging irrational exuberance in some recent IPOs and speculative stocks, Cramer believes the strength of legitimate companies provides a solid foundation for continued investment, suggesting that positive performance in strong companies often coincides with speculative runs in weaker ones.

          <p>The California Coastal Commission has voted unanimously to object to SpaceX's proposal to nearly double its annual rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base, from 50 to 95. Commissioners cited significant concerns about the environmental impact of sonic booms on people and wildlife, as well as regulatory issues. The commission argues that most of the launches serve SpaceX's commercial interests, such as its Starlink network, rather than federal government purposes, and thus should be subject to state review. This decision escalates the friction between Elon Musk's company and state regulators, though it may not halt the expansion if the launches are deemed federal activities.</p>

          <p>The American auto industry, particularly legacy automakers like Ford, is confronting a significant challenge from the rapid advancement and affordability of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, has signaled the company sees this as an existential threat and announced drastic measures to compete, including developing a new, cheaper electric truck starting at $30,000. This involves a fundamental retooling of the assembly process to reduce parts and costs, mimicking innovations pioneered by Tesla and advanced by Chinese manufacturers. Despite these efforts, the U.S. industry faces immense hurdles, including China's government subsidies, advanced battery technology, and low labor costs.</p>

          <p>The legacy of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre continues to be a source of deep-seated tension and anger in modern China-Japan relations, especially as China marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. A wave of new Chinese films depicting the horrors of the Japanese occupation is reigniting public sentiment, fueled by a belief that Japan has never fully atoned for its wartime atrocities. This historical grievance is often amplified by Beijing to foster nationalism, while in Japan, the war is remembered differently, focusing more on its own victimhood. The unresolved history creates an ongoing "history war" that complicates diplomatic and public interactions between the two nations.</p>

The meeting occurs amid varied messaging from the White House, which has shifted from cautious optimism to threatening severe consequences if Russia does not agree to end the war.

          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major metropolitan areas, the country's smaller, lower-tier cities and counties are becoming a crucial new driver of consumption. Consumers in these regions often have lighter economic burdens, faster income growth, and greater confidence, leading to stronger purchasing power and a willingness to spend. This expanding middle class is fueling a "consumption upgrade" in areas previously overlooked by major brands. Experts believe this trend is vital for China's goal of shifting its economy toward a consumption-driven model, as the spending potential in these markets remains largely untapped.</p>
