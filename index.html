        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned California Governor Gavin Newsom that withholding state tax payments to the federal government would constitute criminal tax evasion. This warning follows Newsom's threat to cut tax payments in response to potential federal funding cuts targeting California, including its university system. Bessent criticized Newsom's comments as reckless and advised him to propose a tax-cutting plan for California instead. The dispute arose after reports that the Trump administration was considering withholding federal grants from California due to disagreements over energy, immigration, and other policies.

          <p>Terron Armstead, a four-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman, has retired from the NFL after 12 years due to the debilitating effects of injuries sustained throughout his career.

He explained that he was unable to practice and could not walk without assistance until several days after each game. Armstead expressed gratitude and peace with his decision, emphasizing his full investment in maximizing his God-given abilities. The Saints drafted Armstead in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft.

          <p>The Major League Soccer Players Association (MLSPA) has criticized MLS's proposal for distributing Club World Cup prize money, deeming the 20% payout "below the international standard." The proposal would allocate 20% of performance-based prize money to players at each tournament stage, without a cap. The MLSPA noted the league's attempts to "strong-arm" players into CBA waivers unrelated to the Club World Cup. The Seattle Sounders previously protested the prize money structure, with the MLSPA stating the league failed to offer a reasonable proposal. Negotiations continue as the Club World Cup approaches.

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center reports that Barbara is located about 170 miles southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. The storm is moving west-northwest and is not expected to directly impact land. However, portions of Mexico's western states may experience heavy rainfall, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. Swells with life-threatening surf and rip currents are also likely along the southwestern coast. The tone is cautious.</p>
