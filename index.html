          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the notion of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has died at 97. His film sparked controversy by interviewing ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, revealing collaboration and indifference towards Jewish persecution. Despite initial bans, the film gained critical acclaim and influenced historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls continued directing documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," and explored his own life in "Ainâ€™t Misbehavin'."</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged drone attacks overnight, despite President Trump's criticism of both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian officials reported engaging numerous targets, including in Kyiv, while Russia claimed to have downed 128 Ukrainian drones. The attacks targeted facilities producing Russian Shahed drones and chemical enterprises, highlighting the ongoing conflict's intensity. Trump expressed displeasure with Putin's actions and criticized Zelenskyy's rhetoric, reflecting the complex dynamics of the situation. Ukrainian officials are urging Trump to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow and are requesting a 30-day ceasefire for peace talks.</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," has released a new movie called "Mountainhead," a satire of tech oligarchs, premiering on HBO. The film follows three billionaires who gather at a friend's modernist vacation home in Utah, and one of the billionaires releases new content tools on his social media platform that makes it easier than ever to create deepfakes of ordinary people. The movie explores themes of technological power, technofeudalism, and the potential for societal collapse, as the characters contemplate taking over failing nations and even coup out the U.S. The article argues that art can make such figures feel real in a more visceral, emotional way, and that it's important for pop culture to engage with America's disorienting descent into clownish authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for remarks made at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, where she suggested that most Republican women are "handmaidens to the patriarchy." The article argues that Clinton herself has benefited from and defended powerful men throughout her career, including her husband, Bill Clinton, during his presidency and after allegations of sexual misconduct. It also references accusations that Clinton's team was warned about Harvey Weinstein's behavior, suggesting a pattern of protecting men in positions of power. The author concludes that Clinton's comments are hypocritical and that the eventual female president should not use women as a punching bag.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter R. Orszag, former budget director, argues it's time to worry about the national debt as the fiscal situation in the U.S. has deteriorated significantly. Annual federal budget deficits are running high, interest rates have more than doubled, and the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare. He suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and promoting policies that generate fiscal savings. Orszag notes that the budget legislation moving through Congress would only exacerbate the challenges by further expanding the deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A slowdown in international travel to the U.S. is threatening to destabilize the tourism industry, which is vital to the nation's economy. Factors contributing to the decline include stricter immigration policies, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and aggressive tariff policies. Small border towns like Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, which rely heavily on Canadian visitors, are experiencing significant drops in traffic. As a result, communities are shifting their focus to attracting domestic travelers to offset the losses from international tourism.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency (ESA) will broadcast Johann Strauss II's "By the Beautiful Blue Danube" waltz into space to celebrate its 50th anniversary and the 200th anniversary of Strauss' birth.

The ESA aims to correct the "cosmic mistake" of the waltz's absence from NASA's Voyager Golden Record in 1977.

          <p>Hamilton, Montana, is facing economic challenges due to federal worker cuts at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a key biomedical research facility. As of early May, 41 workers have been let go, contracts are ending, and research grants have been slashed. The cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce the NIH budget and eliminate jobs, sparking concerns about the future of the lab and the local economy.

Taiwan has welcomed the move as a protection of the rights and interests of Taiwanese in Japan, while China has criticized it, asserting that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The Japanese ministry decided on the change partly to avoid any confusion associated with marriage or divorce between Japanese and foreigners.</p>

          <p>A review of BBC Sport pundits' predictions for the Premier League season reveals that none accurately foresaw Liverpool's title win. While Opta's supercomputer correctly identified the top four teams, it also failed to predict the champion. Fara Williams was one of the few pundits to include all top-four teams in her predictions, showcasing the difficulty in forecasting the league's outcome. The article highlights the unpredictable nature of football and the limitations of relying solely on data or expert opinions.</p>
