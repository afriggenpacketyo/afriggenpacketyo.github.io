          <p>Approximately 100 protestors gathered in Charlbury, a village in the Cotswolds, to demonstrate against US Vice President JD Vance during his private holiday in the UK. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, the event featured demonstrators with placards criticizing his political stances on issues like Ukraine and climate change. Residents expressed frustration over the significant security presence and disruption caused by his visit, arguing that his politics are unwelcome in their community. The protest highlights local opposition to the vice president's presence in an area known for attracting affluent and powerful figures.</p>

          <p>The UK's car industry is confronting a severe downturn, with production hitting its lowest level since 1953. The recent closure of a historic Vauxhall plant in Luton highlights a trend of factory shutdowns, contributing to significant job losses and threatening the entire automotive ecosystem. Experts warn that the industry is nearing a point of no return due to the loss of critical mass, which impacts skilled jobs and regional economies. Factors like Brexit, high energy costs, and the difficult transition to electric vehicles have created a challenging environment, though recent investments in EV production offer a glimmer of hope.</p>

          <p>An Obama-appointed federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a female high school track runner in Pennsylvania who challenged the policy allowing her to compete against a transgender athlete. The plaintiff, Aislin Magalengo, argued that competing against a trans student was unfair, but Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled the complaint lacked factual allegations of purposeful sex-based discrimination. The lawsuit was filed against the Quakertown Community High School and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. The plaintiff's attorney has stated their intention to appeal the decision, maintaining the issue is about fairness in women's athletics.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), sparking alarm among economists. The nomination followed the firing of the previous commissioner after a jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring. Antoni, a contributor to the "Project 2025" plan, is a vocal critic of the BLS and has suggested the agency could suspend its monthly jobs reports. This move has raised serious concerns about the potential politicization of the traditionally nonpartisan agency and the integrity of crucial U.S. economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to "stay the course" and not sell off stocks in response to political turbulence, such as President Trump's recent decisions regarding tariffs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He argued that investors who exit the market out of pessimism often miss subsequent rallies, as was seen with recent record highs in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Cramer suggested that while some White House actions may seem concerning, they are often manageable for large corporations, which continue to generate strong profits. He emphasized that corporate earnings and resilience should be the primary focus for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling requires ICE to provide sleeping mats, hygiene products, access to medication, and adequate legal counsel, and it also limits the number of people who can be held there. The order came after a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, supported by video evidence, revealed detainees were held in overcrowded, unsanitary rooms without beds or proper toilets. A government lawyer acknowledged the deficiencies during the hearing, leading to the judge's intervention.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed that Russia has signaled a potential willingness to end the war, a message conveyed via a U.S. special envoy. Despite this, Zelenskyy expressed strong reservations about the upcoming one-on-one summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, stating that "talks about us, without us, will not work." He firmly rejected any possibility of Ukraine withdrawing its forces from the occupied Donbas region, viewing it as a critical defensive line. Zelenskyy believes the summit primarily benefits Putin by providing him with a high-profile photo opportunity and insists European allies must be involved.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, mandating more thorough background checks for police officer candidates across the state. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a former sheriff's deputy, Sean Grayson, who had a documented history of misconduct at previous law enforcement jobs. The new law requires agencies to review an applicant's complete employment records, including performance and disciplinary history, before making a job offer. The reform aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from being hired and to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities.</p>

The case tests the limits of presidential authority and the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic policing.

          <p>In a town hall for Census Bureau employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that Congress, not the president, has the final authority over the national census. His remarks follow President Trump's call for a "new" census that would exclude non-legal residents, a move experts say is unconstitutional and practically impossible. Lutnick also suggested that while undocumented immigrants must be counted, they should be identified as such in the data. This development comes amid a Republican push to use census data for mid-decade redistricting to maintain control of the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Rangers have progressed to the Champions League play-off round, where they will face Club Brugge, despite losing 2-1 to Viktoria Plzen in the second leg of their qualifier. While securing a spot in the final qualifying stage is a positive outcome, the performance raised concerns for manager Russell Martin, who criticized his team for being sloppy and conceding too many chances. Goalkeeper Jack Butland made several crucial saves to prevent a worse result, highlighting the team's defensive vulnerabilities. The team's run has been described as lucky, and significant improvements will be needed to reach the lucrative group stage.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has completed the signing of 24-year-old German defender Malick Thiaw from AC Milan for a reported fee of £34.6 million. Thiaw is the club's third major signing of the summer, as manager Eddie Howe aims to strengthen his defensive options and lower the squad's average age ahead of their return to European competition. The center-back, who has experience in the Champions League, Bundesliga, and Serie A, expressed his excitement to join the club. The signing is a key acquisition for Newcastle after a challenging transfer window where they missed out on several other targets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly altered the U.S. State Department's annual global human rights report, softening criticism of allies like El Salvador and Israel while increasing censure of others like Brazil and South Africa. The 2024 report omits mentions of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and removes previous findings of significant abuses in El Salvador. According to officials, the report was delayed for months as Trump appointees revised it to align with "America First" values, including removing most references to LGBTQ+ rights. The changes reflect a shift away from traditional U.S. promotion of human rights.</p>

The 35-year-old expressed a strong motivation to refocus and show up for his team in the upcoming season.

          <p>Syria is attempting to rebuild its economy after the toppling of its long-standing dictatorship by opposition fighters who have now formed a new government. The country is grappling with a severe financial crisis, though its efforts have received a potential boost after the United States lifted most sanctions. However, reconstruction is being significantly hampered by a severe lack of liquidity and the deep-seated effects of years of corruption and conflict.

          <p>This article outlines the unique legal framework governing President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Washington D.C. Because D.C. is a federal district, the president has direct authority over its National Guard, which can be activated under Title 32, granting them arrest powers without being subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1973 Home Rule Act also allows the president to assume temporary control of the city's Metropolitan Police Department in an emergency, a power he has invoked. This federal takeover is a source of tension with local officials, who have described the move as unsettling and unprecedented.</p>

          <p>A review of the play "Berta, Berta" by Angelica Chéri highlights its West Coast premiere as an intense and mythic production by the Echo Theater Company. The two-character drama, set in 1923 Mississippi, follows the tumultuous reunion of former lovers, Berta and Leroy, after he commits a crime and faces a return to the notorious Parchman Farm prison. The review praises the lead performances by Kacie Rogers and DeJuan Christopher and the direction by Andi Chapman, which embraces the play's supernatural and historical weight.
