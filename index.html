          <h2>Report Criticizes German Immigration Policies for Ignoring Global Challenges</h2>

          <p>A new report from the Bonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC) asserts that Germany's refugee policies are inadequate for addressing current global displacement issues. The report criticizes Chancellor Friedrich Merz's plans to tighten border controls, arguing that such measures are ineffective and lead to more dangerous migration routes, benefiting human traffickers. Researchers emphasize the need for multilateral refugee and migrant policies, urging Germany to take a leadership role in developing European and global responses rather than fragmented national ones. The report also highlights that detaining people seeking protection in camps for long periods exacerbates the problem, and that providing legal security and improved life prospects in their home countries is the only viable long-term solution.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is set to report its quarterly earnings amidst a challenging economic backdrop marked by high interest rates and a sluggish housing market. The retailer has been focusing on attracting more business from home professionals, including the acquisition of SRS Distribution. Despite these efforts, Home Depot faces potential cost pressures from higher tariffs on imports, which could impact prices for consumers. The company projects modest sales growth for fiscal 2025, but faces headwinds in the housing sector, where higher mortgage rates are delaying home purchases and renovation projects.

          <p>Scientists warn that even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, significant sea-level rise is still expected, posing dangers to coastlines. The research, based on studies of ice sheet changes and historical data, suggests continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica due to long-term temperature impacts. Researchers stress that every fraction of a degree of warming avoided will still greatly limit the risks. Current projections indicate the planet is on track for nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming, which could lead to devastating impacts on coastal communities, potentially causing mass land migration.</p>

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, discusses Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer, drawing parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis suggests that Biden's situation presents an opportunity for him to demonstrate leadership on a human level, transcending political divides. She emphasizes the emotional challenges that come with a cancer diagnosis and encourages Biden to be open about his experiences, potentially restoring trust with voters who may feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term. By sharing his personal journey, Biden could provide comfort and understanding to millions facing similar struggles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration's decision to terminate deportation protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. The ruling lifts a hold that was placed by a California judge that kept Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in place for Venezuelans whose status would have expired last month. This action marks a significant shift in immigration policy, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of individuals who were granted TPS due to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. The decision has been met with criticism, with some describing it as the largest single action stripping non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history.</p>

It also describes a president and inner circle enamored with the Biden mythology, where skepticism was forbidden. The review highlights instances of Biden's decline and the efforts by his team to mask his condition, raising questions about the party's self-definition beyond anti-Trumpism.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in Fox News draws parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, arguing that both men share ideological similarities as outsiders challenging the political establishment. The article points to Reagan's opposition to the establishment and his focus on individual liberties, traits mirrored in Trump's policies and rhetoric. While acknowledging differences in style, the author contends that both leaders acted on conservative ideas and resonated with blue-collar voters. The piece suggests that the Republican Party has embraced a cluster of issues centered on the importance of the individual, which both Reagan and Trump pursued.</p>

While some states, like South Carolina, cover GLP-1s for Medicaid beneficiaries, stringent prerequisites limit access. The decision reflects concerns about the high cost of these drugs and the potential financial burden on public health programs. Meanwhile, some experts continue to advocate for broader access to GLP-1s as a tool to combat obesity, but acknowledge the need for a comprehensive approach that includes lifestyle changes and addresses the expense and potential risks of the medications.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has lowered the five-year loan prime rate, a key reference for mortgage loans, in an effort to stabilize the struggling property market. The move comes as Beijing seeks to boost domestic demand and ensure economic stability amid heightened external risks under Donald Trump’s second presidency. However, analysts suggest that the moderate rate cut may not be sufficient to revive the sector, which has been a drag on the economy due to solvency issues among major real estate developers. The one-year loan prime rate, the reference for corporate loans, was also cut by 0.1 percentage points.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports, collecting them has been challenging due to increased smuggling and understaffing at federal agencies. Higher tariffs, particularly on Chinese goods, have created more incentives for businesses to skirt the law through practices like transshipping. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces a lack of resources to effectively inspect and enforce tariffs, exacerbated by chronic understaffing and a surge in planned retirements. Business owners have proposed legislation to fund a DOJ task force to prosecute trade fraud cases, but a government-wide hiring freeze complicates these efforts.</p>

The thrusters ensure the antenna remains pointed at Earth, and even slight misalignment could sever contact. The team suspected that the heaters on the primary thrusters had turned themselves off because of an electronics glitch. The fix was critical because the Deep Space Station 43, used to send commands to both Voyagers, was scheduled to go offline for upgrades, limiting communication capabilities.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, surged over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the electric vehicle market. However, U.S. onshore investors were blocked from buying its stock as a “decoupling” of finance continued. This exclusion highlights the deepening rift between the United States and China, with CATL caught in the crossfire of sanctions and tariffs. The company intends to use the funds raised to expand its operations in Europe, but faces political challenges in the United States due to its ties to Chinese technology.</p>

In particular, the Red Bull is strong in high-speed corners. This was not as clear at the time of the Japanese Grand Prix as it is now, and that probably explains the reaction at the time to Verstappen's pole lap and win at Suzuka.</p>
