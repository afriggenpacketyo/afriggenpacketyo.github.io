        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, representing a project the director has considered a personal dream for decades. The film, funded by Netflix, stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, exploring the story from both characters' perspectives. Early reviews are mixed, with some critics praising its epic scale and artistry, while others find it lacks substance despite its ambitious 149-minute runtime. Del Toro emphasized his use of physical sets over CGI to enhance actor performances and create a more tangible world for his humanized monster.</p>

          <p>Veteran actress Dyan Cannon, 88, was denied entry to the White House during a recent tour after Secret Service discovered she had previously falsified her age on her passport. Cannon was visiting Washington, D.C., with friends and podcast co-hosts when the discrepancy was flagged, preventing their entry. The actress laughed off the incident in a social media video, stating she had lied about her age years ago and would "do it again." She humorously asserted that age is just a number and that her personal information is nobody's business, a sentiment that drew supportive comments from her followers.</p>

          <p>The US Open at Flushing Meadows has been marked by a series of on-court outbursts and confrontations, reflecting high stress levels among players at the final Grand Slam of the season. Incidents include Daniil Medvedev inciting the crowd and Stefanos Tsitsipas arguing with an opponent at the net after a loss. Players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff attribute the heightened emotions to the pressures of the tournament, the fatigue of a long season, and the uniquely intense and vocal New York City crowds. The article suggests that while drama is common on the tour, the high-profile setting of the US Open amplifies these moments.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, an article explores whether remembering shared Sino-American history from World War II could help improve current bilateral relations. It highlights a lesser-known aspect of the war where American and Chinese forces cooperated against Japanese aggression. This historical partnership included instances of Chinese villagers risking their lives to protect American airmen who were shot down. The piece suggests that revisiting this period of mutual support and shared sacrifice could offer a foundation for fostering better understanding and diplomacy between the two nations from the ground up.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has publicly apologized for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, during their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" and "no class" following a dispute over a net cord point. In a statement, Ostapenko clarified that English is not her native language and her use of the word "education" was meant to refer to tennis etiquette, not Townsend's intelligence. She acknowledged that her words could have been offensive and expressed her commitment to learning and growing as a person.</p>

          <p>A Montana man, Michael Paul Brown, is facing four counts of murder after allegedly killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda on August 1st. Following the shooting, the 45-year-old former soldier evaded a massive weeklong manhunt involving hundreds of officers in the nearby mountains before being captured in an unoccupied structure. Authorities have not yet stated a motive, though his niece indicated he had a history of mental illness. Brown, who lived next door to the bar, is currently being held on $2 million bail and will make his initial court appearance in September.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to prevent Chicago police from being deputized by federal authorities and prohibits officers from concealing their identities with masks, requiring them to display badges and names. It also directs city departments to inform residents of their rights and to monitor federal immigration enforcement activities. The move is a preemptive measure against what the mayor termed potential "militarized activity" by the Trump administration, similar to controversial deployments in other cities.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation suggests that famed sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, her death was believed to be the result of an ambush intended for him. However, modern forensic analysis of exhumed remains and crime scene evidence revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account, including a likely self-inflicted gunshot wound and evidence that the scene was staged. Officials stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough probable cause for a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's health secretary, accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders condemned Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine crusade and promotion of conspiracy theories, which he argues is undermining science and truth from within the Department of Health and Human Services. The call for resignation follows the firing of the CDC director and the subsequent resignation of four other top officials in protest of Kennedy's policies. Sanders warned that Kennedy's actions threaten to reverse decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>

          <h2>UK Councils Continue Legal Challenges Against Use of Hotels for Asylum Seekers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels in their areas from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against such a measure. The court overturned an injunction that had blocked The Bell Hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers, a case seen as a key precedent. However, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne are pressing on with their own legal challenges, citing concerns over planning law breaches and public safety. The ongoing disputes coincide with protests and counter-demonstrations at various hotel sites across England and Scotland.</p>

The collaboration pays homage to Hamburg's local culture, where Currywurst is often enjoyed with an Astra beer.

          <p>A federal judge has dealt a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration agenda by blocking the expanded use of expedited removal. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's policy of applying this streamlined deportation process to migrants found in the interior of the country, often without a court hearing, is unlawful. The ruling curtails the government's ability to quickly remove individuals who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years. In her opinion, the judge emphasized that the government's approach deprived individuals of meaningful due process.</p>

This statement reflects the principle of compound growth, where initial success and capital can lead to exponentially faster returns.

The AI stethoscope records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds with a microphone, sending the data to a cloud-based AI for analysis.
