          <h2>Flash Flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, Washes Away Home Amidst Heavy Rains</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 23:08:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced severe flash flooding following heavy rainfall, resulting in road closures and multiple rescues. Video footage showed a home being swept away by the rushing water, highlighting the destructive power of the floods. This event is part of a recurring problem for the community, as past wildfires have left the surrounding hillsides unable to absorb the intense summer rain, making the area highly vulnerable to burn-scar flooding. As of Thursday evening, officials reported no fatalities or injuries from the latest incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty Border Patrol officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the policies endanger citizens by releasing criminals, while the New York Immigration Coalition defended the laws as crucial for maintaining community trust in law enforcement. The lawsuit intensifies the Trump administration's ongoing pressure on jurisdictions with sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>A significant rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia after a mine collapse trapped three workers underground at the Red Chris copper and gold mine. The miners are located in a refuge chamber with sufficient air, food, and water, but a second cave-in severed communication lines. The operating firm, Newmont, is using specialized drones and remote-controlled equipment to assess the debris field and work towards safely reaching the men. Production at the mine has been suspended as the complex rescue effort continues.</p>

          <p>Three former Justice Department officials, including a veteran federal prosecutor, have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi, challenging their recent firings. The lawsuit argues that their terminations, communicated in brief memos citing presidential authority, violated standard civil service procedures and protections. The plaintiffs, who worked on high-profile cases including the January 6th investigation, claim the firings were arbitrary and unlawful. They are seeking immediate reinstatement and back pay, bringing further scrutiny to a series of dismissals within the department under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to experimentally observe quantum friction between solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not uniformly increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds exhibited less resistance. This counterintuitive effect is linked to how bending the material alters electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing federal immigration raids. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many hard-working people now fear being arrested and deported. The Family Assistance Program will utilize donation-funded resources and existing parish networks developed during the pandemic to serve its community across three counties. The initiative comes as local immigrant communities face heightened anxiety amid thousands of recent arrests by ICE.</p>

          <p>Pop star and actor Renée Rapp, known for her candid and unfiltered interview style, says she finds conventional media training "boring" and prefers authentic conversation. In a recent interview, she reflected on how her outspoken personality became a talking point during the "Mean Girls" press tour, which initially made her feel insecure. Now, she embraces it, even referencing it in her new single "Leave Me Alone." The song was born from the pressure and depression she felt last year, channeling her frustrations into her upcoming album, "Bite Me."</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to quash the convictions of traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, four other traders convicted of manipulating the Libor interest rate are now appealing to have their own convictions overturned. The traders—Jay Merchant, Jonathan Mathew, Philippe Moryoussef, and Christian Bittar—were convicted in a large-scale investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the rate-rigging scandal that was central to the 2008 financial crisis. The successful appeal by Hayes and Palombo sets a strong precedent for these new challenges.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient from El Salvador, who has lived in the U.S. since he was 14, is facing deportation after he accidentally drove across the border into Mexico while working as a rideshare driver. When he attempted to immediately return to the U.S., he was detained by border officials who classified his exit as a "self-deportation." His attorney claims her client, whose wife is about to give birth, made an honest mistake but is being shown no leniency. The case highlights the precarious situation of DACA recipients under the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to have already begun, as several potential Democratic candidates are increasing their media visibility and shifting their messaging. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and shows, including those with conservative hosts, in an apparent effort to reach new voters. This emerging strategy signals a course correction for the party, with some candidates adopting more centrist stances on cultural issues and a more direct communication style. The moves are seen as an attempt to fill a leadership vacuum.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is scorching Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record last set in 1972. The extreme heat is a serious concern for scientists, who point to it as another manifestation of accelerating climate change in the Arctic, which is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The unusual weather is disrupting the region's summer tourism, which is known as a cool destination, and causing distress for local reindeer herds seeking relief from the heat and insects.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal that has drawn significant political scrutiny. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump and commitments from Skydance to address conservative grievances and end diversity initiatives at CBS News. The FCC's sole Democrat dissented, calling the deal a move that would "erode press freedom." Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have suggested the deal appears connected to political influence from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending in a "winner-take-all" race. He pointed to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both urgent and necessary for future dominance. While acknowledging skepticism about the current capabilities of AI chatbots, Cramer believes the technology will improve as companies invest in more advanced hardware from firms like Nvidia. He argues the ultimate winner of the AI race could achieve a near-monopoly and massive profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As regulators, particularly in the U.S., move to ban or phase out artificial food dyes like Red Dye No. 3, technology and food science firms are racing to develop stable, vibrant natural alternatives. Companies are exploring sources like microalgae and specially grown vegetables to create pigments for food and drinks. French firm Fermentalg has successfully developed a blue pigment from algae that has been approved by the FDA. While natural colors can be more expensive and challenging to stabilize, major food giants are pledging to reformulate their products to meet new health standards.</p>
