          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa stated that the company's primary focus is to address its current struggles through major restructuring efforts, despite facing declining sales, the shift to electric vehicles, and intense global competition, especially from Chinese manufacturers. Espinosa emphasized confidence in the company's plan to recover, even with the added pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum. The plan includes slashing 11,000 jobs and closing seven plants, anticipating a 3% drop in sales volumes this fiscal year. The company's previous talks with Honda regarding a potential merger, which could have created the world's third-largest automaker, ended in February. The optimism score reflects the CEO's confidence despite significant challenges. </p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration reports that approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act have been processed, leading to increased benefits and retroactive payments for nearly 3 million individuals. The Social Security Fairness Act, enacted in January, eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for those receiving income from public pensions without Social Security payroll taxes. The agency attributes the faster processing to automation and aims to update all affected beneficiary records by early November, exceeding initial estimates. Commissioner Frank Bisignano has pledged to complete the adjustments promptly. The increased payments for pensioners are a positive development. </p>

The company is currently pursuing a public listing in Hong Kong. The phase 2A clinical trial results, published in Nature Medicine, indicated that rentosertib was generally safe and potentially effective for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). While some patients experienced liver toxicity when taking rentosertib with another IPF drug, the study demonstrated the transformative potential of AI in drug discovery and development, according to Insilico's founder and CEO Alex Zhavoronkov. </p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a new milestone in quantum-based secure direct communications, tripling the distance of a multi-user network to approximately 300km. The researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University reported that their optical fiber network, while currently limited in transmission rate, is theoretically scalable, demonstrating the feasibility of this type of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to conceal the signals. The scientists emphasize the need for further research to realize a large-scale quantum communication network with thousands of users over long distances. </p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is under scrutiny for allegedly assembling a group of extremists and conspiracy theorists to undermine non-government organizations (NGOs) through the House's Delivering on Government Efficiency (Doge) subcommittee. A memo from the Congressional Integrity Project (CIP) criticizes the subcommittee's hearing, titled ‚ÄúPublic Funds, Private Agendas: NGOs Gone Wild,‚Äù as political theater and hypocrisy, given the federal funding received by Republican allies and right-wing groups. The CIP highlights controversial statements and backgrounds of the hearing's witnesses, including accusations of hate group affiliation and potential fraud. The memo accuses Greene of weaponizing government oversight while overlooking the financial benefits her own networks receive from government contracts and subsidies. </p>

He led a rally outside the Supreme Court attended by approximately 2,000 protesters, denouncing the proposed legislation as evil and harmful to the vulnerable.

This statement follows Musk's criticism of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he described as a "disgusting abomination."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill could eliminate a popular workaround for the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for certain business owners. The current $10,000 limit on the SALT deduction, enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, has led many states to implement pass-through entity (PTE) level taxes to bypass the federal limit. Under the proposed bill, certain white-collar professionals, known as a "specified service trade or business" (SSTB), would be blocked from using the SALT deduction workaround, which could have significant financial implications. Some non-SSTB pass-through businesses, however, could benefit from a larger qualified business income (QBI) deduction while still claiming an unlimited SALT deduction via the PTE workaround.

          <p>Major corporations, including Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi, are expressing concern about the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Recent court rulings have added another layer of instability, leading companies to put hiring and investment plans on hold. Experts warn that this paralysis could hinder economic momentum and potentially trigger a downturn. While the Trump administration defends its tariff approach as "strategic uncertainty" to gain leverage in trade negotiations, businesses are facing challenges in evaluating costs and benefits for long-term decisions. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. has taken effect, significantly impacting European steel exporters, but the U.K. has been granted a temporary reprieve with a 25% tariff.

The European Union has expressed strong disapproval, stating that the move undermines trade deal negotiations with the U.S. and has threatened countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

The review cited a lack of curiosity from authorities regarding the parents' lifestyle and warned that safeguarding children impacted by harmful cultural practices is paramount.

The authority to remove Sajet lies with Lonnie G. Bunch III, secretary of the Smithsonian, who is accountable to the Smithsonian‚Äôs Board of Regents.

The cases could have significant implications for the separation of powers, as the Constitution grants Congress the authority to set tariffs. The legal challenges focus on whether the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 provides the president with the power to impose tariffs. </p>

The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, according to the Brookings Institution.
