          <p>Indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to restart in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli military operations continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent airstrikes have resulted in dozens of Palestinian casualties, including in areas designated for displaced people, according to hospital officials. The negotiations, brokered with U.S. involvement, face significant hurdles as Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war, while Israel remains committed to dismantling the militant group's military and governmental capabilities before ceasing hostilities. The conflict, which began after the October 7th attacks, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina early Sunday, with maximum sustained winds decreasing to 35 mph. The National Hurricane Center has discontinued all tropical storm warnings, though scattered showers, heavy rain, and potential flash flooding remain a threat for parts of North and South Carolina. The storm, the third of the Atlantic season, is expected to continue weakening as it moves inland and dissipate by Monday. Flood watches remain in effect for several areas, including Myrtle Beach and Raleigh.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the White House will finalize several new trade deals this week ahead of a key deadline. For countries without an agreement, the administration will send letters outlining future steps, with President Trump making the final judgment on extending the current pause on tariffs. Hassett also defended the administration's new tax and spending bill, arguing that economic models predict it will generate 3% growth, covering its costs and shrinking the deficit, contrary to estimates from the CBO and other organizations. He dismissed concerns about millions losing Medicaid, asserting the bill's work requirements and job creation will increase insurance coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have claimed at least 66 lives, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County. More than two dozen people, including 11 campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp, remain missing after the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, and rescue operations involving over 160 airlifts are ongoing. Officials were caught off guard by the storm's intensity, which saw the river rise about 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming local infrastructure and communities.</p>

          <p>New York Representative Tom Suozzi, speaking on "Face the Nation," described the new Republican-led bill as a "big, ugly bill" that will significantly harm the country. He argued it will increase the national deficit, fuel inflation, and cause many Americans to lose healthcare coverage by undermining the Affordable Care Act. While acknowledging his agreement with about 75% of the package, including border security funding, Suozzi contended that providing tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting benefits for the needy and expanding the deficit is fundamentally flawed.

The criticism intensified after the Fever lost a close game to the Los Angeles Sparks while Clark was sidelined with a groin injury. Fans and sports commentators took to social media to call the analyst's argument—that Clark's absence allows other players to shine—a "dumb take," pointing to the team's 2-3 record without her.

He depicted a state of near-total disintegration, with security having "completely collapsed" and residents looting former Hamas facilities without intervention.

While organizers had initially claimed the act was driven by racial hatred, the Metropolitan Police stated that they do not believe it was a hate crime. Police acknowledged the distress the incident caused the community and have been in contact with the exhibition's organizers as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man from Grand Forks, North Dakota, is facing multiple felony charges after a police search of his impounded vehicle allegedly uncovered significant quantities of illegal drugs. Law enforcement reported finding over 1.5 pounds of methamphetamine, half a pound of marijuana, and 0.02 pounds of cocaine in the man's 2011 Buick Enclave. The most serious charge, Class A felony possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The man, who was already in custody on other matters, reportedly confirmed ownership of the vehicle and its contents. His bond has been set at $100,000.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow's latest book delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the roots of his sardonic humor and enduring cultural impact. Chernow traces Twain's persona to a childhood marked by both adventure and the fear of poverty, which fueled a lifelong pursuit of wealth. The article highlights how Twain's work continues to resonate, with themes of politics, class, race, and get-rich-quick schemes remaining highly relevant today. Chernow argues that Twain, who called himself "the American," embodied both the best and worst of the national culture, using his fame to speak truth to power.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has labeled the proposed elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In a recent interview, Burns pushed back against White House claims that public media like PBS and NPR spread propaganda, arguing that the cuts would disproportionately harm rural areas where PBS is often the only available broadcast signal. He emphasized that PBS provides essential services, including children's programming, educational content, and emergency information. Burns, whose films have been a staple of PBS for decades, stated that his work would not be possible without the public broadcaster's support for long-term projects.</p>

With a July 9 deadline looming, uncertainty has created shockwaves in the global economy. A significant divide has emerged within the EU, with leaders like Germany's Chancellor favoring a quick deal to prevent a trade war, while France's President Macron advocates for holding out for a better, more balanced agreement. The EU is now aiming for a framework agreement similar to the one the UK secured, a concession that a comprehensive deal is unattainable before the deadline.</p>

The report details the collapse of law and order, where armed thieves loot aid and hunger drives desperate people to risk their lives daily.

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru's northern Barranca province, which is believed to have been a crucial trading hub for early American civilizations. The site, located 200km north of Lima, likely connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers say the discovery helps explain the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was impacted by climate change. The city features a central circular structure, ceremonial temples, and residential complexes, where artifacts like clay sculptures and seashell necklaces were unearthed, shedding new light on the region's ancient history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is handing over previously unreleased audio recordings of the 1985 torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena to the defense team of Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero. Camarena's brutal killing marked a turning point in the U.S. war on drugs and led to a massive operation to dismantle the Guadalajara cartel. The tapes, which have been the subject of controversy and speculation for decades, are considered highly sensitive. Their release is a significant development in the federal prosecution of Caro Quintero, who was captured in 2022 and is facing drug trafficking and murder charges in New York.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was originally conceived to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States, not as a symbol of immigration. However, its meaning was transformed over time, largely influenced by poet Emma Lazarus's 1883 sonnet "The New Colossus," which reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles" welcoming the world's "huddled masses." The subsequent opening of the Ellis Island immigration facility nearby and the eventual end of restrictive ethnic immigration quotas in 1965 solidified Lady Liberty's modern identity as a powerful beacon of hope and a promise of welcome for immigrants arriving in America.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's war in Gaza, and the international community's response, is causing a collapse of the post-WWII global order by eroding established norms of international law and free speech. Using the story of a Palestinian-American student whose university degree is being withheld over her activism, the author contends that rules are being strategically rewritten to suppress dissent. The piece claims that the failure to hold Israel accountable for actions like bombing hospitals and using starvation as a weapon threatens to normalize such atrocities, fundamentally breaking the system designed to prevent them.

While potential Chinese investors are concerned about the geopolitical climate, mayors in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive.

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach highlights five common, overused phrases that can unintentionally make a person seem judgmental, potentially damaging professional and personal relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, while preambles such as "To be honest…" can imply prior dishonesty and put others on the defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity, collaboration, and humility, such as asking questions, using "yes, and..." to build on ideas, and framing opinions as one perspective among many. Adopting these more thoughtful communication habits can help build trust and respect.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly ramping up its political influence in the Western Balkans, using a combination of soft power and economic investment, a strategy some experts call "infrastructure imperialism." A key example is the new grand mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, which gives Turkey influence over its board. This religious outreach is coupled with major Turkish investments in infrastructure across the region, from railways to hotels. This strategy positions Turkey, under President Erdogan, as the heir to the Ottoman Empire and a growing regional power, projecting an image of a modern, influential nation.</p>

Arguing for a "polluter pays approach," the commissioner questioned why event organizers who require a police presence do not pay for the service, which diverts resources from local communities. The comments were made as Sir Mark called for a radical reform of UK policing, suggesting the current 43-force model be consolidated into 12 to 15 larger forces to better manage overstretched funding and modern threats.</p>

          <p>A key narrative driving the current stock market rally is the strong investor belief that the Federal Reserve will implement a significant number of interest rate cuts in 2026. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, the market appears to be pricing in as many as seven rate cuts for that year, creating a tailwind for valuations despite more cautious near-term guidance from the Fed. This forward-looking optimism is fueling investor confidence and buying activity, even with five months remaining in 2025 that hold potential economic and political volatility. The market's focus on a distant easing cycle highlights a powerful, if speculative, driver behind recent gains. (not investment advice)</p>
