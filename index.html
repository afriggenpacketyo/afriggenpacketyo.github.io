          <p>The Sports Bra, a women's sports bar in Portland, Oregon, has gained popularity since opening in 2022, aiming to provide a space where women's sports are prominently displayed and celebrated. Founder Jenny Nguyen envisioned a place where young girls could feel a sense of belonging in sports, with the goal of inspiring future generations. The bar's success reflects a growing interest in women's sports, but Nguyen emphasizes that there is still work to be done in achieving equality for female athletes, particularly in areas like media coverage and compensation. The article notes that the number of women's sports bars in the United States is expected to quadruple by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>In an effort to save endangered water voles in Wales, conservationists are feeding them edible glitter to track their movements. Water vole populations have declined by 90% in the past 30 years, prompting the Wildlife Trust to seek innovative tracking methods. By using different colors of glitter, conservationists hope to identify family territories and their ranges. This tracking data will inform habitat adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers and fencing off riverbanks, to help the species disperse and thrive. The article highlights the seriousness of the conservation efforts and the potential life-saving impact of this intervention.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists are investigating a mass grave in Alberta, Canada, containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils to determine how these dinosaurs died. The site, nicknamed the "River of Death," is believed to be one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique snapshot of a single community of animals. Researchers hypothesize that a flash flood wiped out a migrating herd of Pachyrhinosaurus, with the fast-flowing water churning up sediment and bones. The article also discusses the discovery of Edmontosaurus bones in the area, contributing to a broader understanding of the ancient ecosystem. The findings will be featured in the BBC series 'Walking With Dinosaurs'.</p>

Swim England failed to act on a 2012 investigation recommending Rudd's suspension after hearing evidence from 17 witnesses. The article also highlights the case of Antony James, a Plymouth Leander swimmer jailed for sexual assault, raising questions about Rudd's awareness of James' behavior. Rudd, who is due to become high performance director of Saudi Arabia's Olympic swimming team, has not responded to the BBC.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Retail sales rose 5.1% year-on-year, missing analysts' estimates, while industrial output grew 6.1%, exceeding expectations despite U.S. tariffs. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged external uncertainties but emphasized the resilience of China's economy, particularly in diversifying exports to Southeast Asian countries. Automobile sales showed minimal growth, and the real estate sector continued to struggle, indicating domestic demand remains weak.

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Kyle Chan argues that China is pulling ahead of the United States in economic and technological power, potentially marking the beginning of a "Chinese century." He criticizes the Trump administration's focus on trade wars and its undermining of American innovation through tariff impositions and cuts to research funding. Chan highlights China's leadership in various industries and its massive investments in future technologies like quantum computing and robotics. The article suggests that the United States needs to shift its focus to long-term investments in research, innovation, and global partnerships to avoid being dominated by China in high-end manufacturing and technology.</p>

          <p>A downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moody's, combined with concerns about rising government debt, is causing turmoil in financial markets. The downgrade, driven by worries over the fiscal deficit and the potential for trillions of dollars in new debt from proposed tax cuts, means all three major rating agencies no longer give the US their top credit rating. This has led to declines in stock futures and weakened the U.S. dollar, with analysts fearing further market disruption if Treasury bonds lose their safe-haven status. The article suggests the downgrade is exacerbating existing concerns about President Trump's tariff policies and their impact on the American economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unfolding corruption investigation involving the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has led to multiple detentions and scrutiny of arms and ammunition deals. The probe, initiated by the agency itself, involves allegations of employees passing information to defense contractors, with potential money laundering through consultancy companies. This investigation serves as a reminder of the risks associated with increased defense spending, as NATO countries commit to spending at least 3.5% of their GDP amid the war in Ukraine. The article emphasizes the need for thorough oversight and transparency in the defense sector to prevent corruption and ensure effective use of public funds.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. is facing criticism for a "tasteless" social media post mocking former First Lady Jill Biden and hinting at a conspiracy related to former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis.

          <p>Prostate cancer experts say that while former President Joseph R. Biden’s diagnosis is serious, advances in treatment and diagnosis now improve survival by years. The cancer has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from Mr. Biden’s personal office. The first line of attack is to cut off the testosterone that feeds prostate cancer. Dr. Moul said that when he started out as a urologist in the 1980s, this was done by removing a man’s testicles. Today, men have a choice of two drugs given by injection that block the testicles from making testosterone or a pill that does the same thing.</p>
