          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, who was born in the UK and grew up in Nigeria and the US, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that while she is Nigerian by ancestry, her identity is now rooted in the UK, where she has spent most of her life. Badenoch mentioned she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and that her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her political views, including her aversion to socialism.</p>

The conflict had resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people. According to reports, Trump's threat to halt trade negotiations with both nations was instrumental in bringing them to the negotiating table and achieving the truce.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has discovered that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event involving a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced its evolution back approximately nine million years. The study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that a tomato ancestor crossbred with a non-tuberous, potato-like plant. This pivotal event was a key driver in the development of tubers, the edible part that has made the potato a global food staple.</p>

The court rejected the government's claim of irreparable harm, stating that the injunction simply enforces 4th Amendment protections.

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump, just one day after Trump publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, lower their drug prices. The president sent letters to 17 drugmakers asking them to match the lower prices paid in other countries. The fundraiser, held at Trump's New Jersey golf club, aimed to raise $25 million for a pro-Trump super PAC. This situation highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry amid ongoing debates about prescription drug costs.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hearing has provided new insights into the fatal midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January. The crash, which killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft, may have been influenced by an inaccurate altimeter on the helicopter. Testimony revealed that such discrepancies were not considered unusual and that FAA staff had previously raised concerns about the helicopter's flight path proximity to commercial flights, but no action was taken, prompting sharp criticism from the NTSB chair.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant increase in stingray-related injuries, rising from one to about ten per day. The uptick is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, where more people are swimming. Officials are advising beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish of their presence. If stung, the recommended treatment is to soak the affected area in hot water to break down the venom and relieve pain.</p>

          <p>A regulatory analysis from the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicates that its plan to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards would lead to higher gasoline prices. The data, originally from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, shows that rescinding policies that encourage fuel efficiency and EV adoption would increase demand for gasoline, thus raising prices for all consumers. The analysis also projected the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 under the proposed deregulation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trade experts are warning that President Trump's executive order to hike tariffs on imports will likely lead to higher consumer prices and prolonged uncertainty for businesses. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries, the average U.S. tariff rate has risen to its highest level in decades. Economists predict this will increase the cost of everyday goods like clothing, toys, and furniture, potentially costing the average American household over $2,000 per year. Businesses now face a challenging environment with unanswered questions about implementation. (not investment advice)</p>

The massive insect, named Acrophylla alta, is extremely elusive and thought to inhabit the high canopies of rainforests. The discovery was made in a remote, high-elevation area, highlighting how much biodiversity remains unknown, even in well-studied regions. Scientists expressed concern that many species may be lost before they are ever discovered due to habitat loss.</p>

The public pressure on the central bank's independence comes as the administration faces questions about its economic policies and a new jobs report indicated a market slowdown.

          <p>A tractor-trailer carrying hot dogs experienced a mechanical problem on Interstate-83 in Pennsylvania, causing its trailer to rip open and spill its entire load across the highway. The incident occurred during the morning commute near Shrewsbury, leading to significant traffic delays. Cleanup crews, including the local fire company, used a front-end loader to scoop the sausages off the road. While four people sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the initial accident, the main disruption was the unusual and slippery cleanup task.</p>
