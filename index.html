          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering his classmate, Harvey Willgoose, also 15, at a Catholic high school in Sheffield. The verdict came after a month-long trial where the jury heard the defendant stabbed Willgoose in the heart during a lunch break following a social media quarrel. While the defendant admitted to manslaughter and possessing a knife, he denied the murder charge, claiming he had "snapped" and lost control. He was convicted by a majority verdict and is scheduled to be sentenced in October.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a controversial plan to take military control of Gaza City, a move condemned by world leaders and opposed by some Israeli military officials and hostage families. The plan outlines five principles for ending the war, including the disarmament of Hamas and establishing an alternative civilian administration. The UN warns this escalation could lead to massive forced displacement and more casualties. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated an intention to eventually hand Gaza over to unspecified "Arab forces," though the timeline and details of the operation remain unclear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market has demonstrated surprising resilience, largely ignoring recent weak economic data, including slowing job growth and reduced GDP figures. Analysts suggest this stability is driven by strong corporate earnings from major tech companies and investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Despite concerns about a potential recession and the economic condition known as "stagflation," the market's current mindset appears to favor risk-taking in pursuit of immediate rewards over caution about future headwinds.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump to announce a $600 billion investment in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing the administration without committing to manufacturing iPhones domestically. The plan involves expanding partnerships with long-term American suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components. This strategy successfully garnered praise from Trump and an exemption for Apple from a new tariff on chips, boosting its stock price. Analysts view the announcement as a savvy political maneuver to avoid tariffs, rather than a fundamental shift in Apple's production strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences reveals a significant environmental paradox in China, where extreme rainfall in cities is increasing while the volume of water in its rivers has been steadily declining. The study, which analyzed data from 1956 to 2016, found that over 72% of the country's hydrological stations reported a decrease in river run-off. This trend is particularly pronounced in northern China. These findings raise serious concerns for a nation that relies on its rivers to sustain a population of 1.4 billion people, vast agricultural lands, and the world's largest industrial output.</p>

He promised they would marry someday, a commitment that was enough for her. The couple eventually married after she enrolled in graduate school, and they remain happily together, reflecting on how their journey began with a difficult conversation.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey indicates that President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory, with a 51%-46% disapproval margin. However, the survey also reveals a historic low in the Democratic Party's favorability, which has sunk to a net -32 points. While Democrats hold a slight preference for congressional control, the public holds negative views on the president's handling of most key issues, except for border security. The data suggests a conflicting political landscape, with voters expressing dissatisfaction across the board while Republicans remain solidly behind the president. (not investment advice)</p>

This event comes as the Gifford fire, now the state's largest of the year, continues to burn in central California.

          <p>Youth sports in America have transformed from casual, play-based activities into a highly commercialized, high-stakes industry, creating significant problems for families. The rise of expensive pay-to-play leagues, with average costs exceeding $1,000 per child, is pricing out lower-income families and widening a class divide in participation. For those who can afford it, the intense focus on winning and securing college scholarships is leading to increased rates of youth anxiety, depression, and overuse injuries. Experts argue that this adult-driven model has become the organizing principle of family life, undermining the recreational and mental health benefits sports should provide.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's historical four-year price cycle, traditionally centered around its "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down due to changing market dynamics. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has introduced significant institutional investment, altering predictable patterns by causing a price surge before the last halving, rather than after. Experts suggest that a more supportive regulatory environment and increased accumulation by long-term holders are replacing the old cycle with more stable, macro-correlated behavior.

          <p>China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), has sought to reassure investors about the potential impact of a proposed 100% U.S. tariff on chip imports. Co-CEO Zhao Haijun stated that the company's production capacity is already in a state of demand exceeding supply and that its exposure to the U.S. market is limited. The comments came after SMIC reported a 16.2% year-on-year revenue increase but a 19.5% decline in net profit for the second quarter. Zhao noted that previous tariff disputes had a minimal effect on the company's overseas clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mostafa Tajzadeh, a former deputy interior minister and prominent Iranian political prisoner, is emerging as a figure who could potentially bridge the divide between Iran's internal reformists and anti-regime opponents. Currently serving another prison sentence, Tajzadeh has called for the abolition of the supreme leader's position while still advocating for non-violent, incremental change. His unique stance has earned him respect from both sides of the fractured opposition, including those in the diaspora. Supporters see his willingness to engage in dialogue and pay a personal price for his convictions as crucial for Iran's future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical analysis of recent trade deals with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea suggests they are less beneficial to the U.S. than claimed by the Trump administration. While the deals avoided retaliatory tariffs, they contain few meaningful concessions from trading partners on long-standing barriers, particularly for agricultural products. Furthermore, the massive investment pledges, totaling over a trillion dollars, appear to be largely based on pre-existing plans or loans rather than firm new commitments. The article argues the main outcome is simply America's right to impose its own tariffs, which may ultimately harm domestic manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bull moose that had lingered on a popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains since May, forcing its closure, has been euthanized by state environmental officials. Wildlife biologists determined the four-year-old animal was severely emaciated and showed signs of advanced disease, with a low chance of survival. The Goodman Mountain trail had been closed since June after the moose began exhibiting unusual behavior and would not leave the area. A necropsy will be performed to better understand the cause of its health decline and gather data on threats facing New York's growing moose population.</p>

Weeks of intermittent strikes had raised concerns among restaurant owners about supply chain disruptions. The Food, Beverages and Catering Union confirmed a new wage agreement that establishes a starting salary of €2,600 per month, creating a more transparent pay structure for the factory's workforce.

          <p>An analysis of Mark Zuckerberg's recent statements on artificial intelligence suggests his vision for the technology is surprisingly limited and bleak. While spending billions to hire top AI talent, Zuckerberg has framed his goal as developing a "personal superintelligence" accessed through devices like smart glasses to help people be better friends. Critics argue this lacks the world-changing ambition of other tech leaders and primarily serves Meta's existing business model of driving engagement on platforms like Instagram to sell more ads. This commercial focus may fail to inspire the top researchers needed to achieve true breakthroughs in AI.</p>
