          <p>Chicago is preparing for expanded immigration enforcement actions, prompting strong pushback from local and state Democratic leaders against President Trump's social media posts threatening federal intervention. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the president's rhetoric as authoritarian, while the White House criticized their priorities. In anticipation of increased ICE activity, fencing has been erected around the federal courthouse and a major Mexican Independence Day festival was postponed over community safety concerns.</p>

          <p>At its recent party conference, Reform UK made a concerted effort to showcase a wider range of political figures beyond its well-known leader, Nigel Farage. The party aims to dispel the perception that it is a "one-man-band" by promoting new defectors and local leaders who could become future candidates. This strategy is part of a broader ambition to significantly increase its number of elected officials across the country, though it faces the challenge of properly vetting thousands of new candidates to avoid past scandals.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing for the upcoming November budget amidst a challenging backdrop of market instability and recent cabinet changes. While recent fluctuations in UK government bond yields have mirrored global trends rather than indicating a UK-specific crisis, the fragile market serves as a warning against increasing government debt. The final budget measures will be heavily influenced by the Office for Budget Responsibility's long-term economic forecasts, particularly on productivity, which will determine the extent of tax increases or spending cuts required.

          <p>Davey Johnson, a celebrated figure in Major League Baseball, has died at the age of 82. As a player, he was a four-time All-Star and won two World Series championships with the Baltimore Orioles. He is perhaps best remembered for his managerial career, during which he led the New York Mets to their memorable 1986 World Series title, and he remains the winningest manager in the franchise's history. Johnson also managed several other teams, including the Reds, Orioles, Dodgers, and Nationals.</p>

          <p>A former British Army officer who served in Iraq has co-founded a support group called Sisters in Service to help female military veterans who now work in healthcare. The organization aims to combat the isolation and lack of understanding many women face after leaving the armed forces, as public perception often overlooks their front-line roles. The group provides a community for members to connect over shared experiences, offering a vital network that can be difficult to find in traditional veterans' spaces.</p>

          <p>A massive tourism project at Egypt's Mount Sinai, a sacred site for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is causing significant controversy. The development includes luxury hotels and villas, which critics argue is destroying the area's pristine, spiritual character and has led to the displacement of the local Jebeleya Bedouin tribe with little compensation. The project has also created diplomatic tensions with Greece over the status of the historic St. Catherine's Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is located in the development area.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list for 21 years, is facing an extradition hearing in London. He is accused of planting bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with attacks claimed by an animal rights extremist group. After a dramatic car chase in 2003, San Diego vanished, only to be discovered last year living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in central London against the UK government's decision to ban the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in the arrest of more than 425 people. Most arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization, which is a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The Metropolitan Police reported that officers faced an exceptional level of abuse, including physical assaults, while organizers accused the police of using violent tactics against peaceful protesters who were holding signs to defy what they call a ridiculous law.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to combat violent crime has elicited sharply divided reactions within the city's communities. In some neighborhoods plagued by violence, residents expressed support for the intervention, hoping it will restore order. However, community leaders and activists on the South Side argue that they are the real "troops" and that sustained funding for anti-violence programs, not militarization, is the solution to the city's problems, which have already seen a significant drop in homicides.</p>

          <p>Despite a surprisingly shaky first half, England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured a dominant 47-7 victory over Australia to advance to the World Cup quarter-finals. Australia initially unsettled the hosts, taking an early lead and disrupting England's usually formidable driving maul. However, England's superior depth and defense took control in the second half, shutting out the Wallaroos completely and extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive matches as they head into the knockout stage.</p>
