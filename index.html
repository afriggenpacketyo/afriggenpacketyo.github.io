            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for breaking a 30-hour Easter truce announced by Vladimir Putin. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy stated Russian troops violated the ceasefire over 2,000 times, while Russia claimed to have repelled Ukrainian assaults and drone attacks. The BBC has not independently verified either side's claims. Despite the broken truce, President Trump expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has urged the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order regarding the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García. She suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for the deportation or their refusal to facilitate his return. This comes after Justice Alito dissented on a Supreme Court decision blocking the deportation of Venezuelans, criticizing the majority's handling of the case. Klobuchar emphasized the need for courts, constituents, and Congress to stand up to maintain democracy amidst what she sees as Trump's attempts to create a constitutional crisis.</p>
