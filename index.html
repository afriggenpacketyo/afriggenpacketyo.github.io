          <p>This opinion article argues for the confirmation of Eric Tung to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a nomination made by President Trump. The author, a former colleague, highlights Tung's exceptional credentials, including his education at Yale and the University of Chicago Law School, as well as clerkships for Justice Neil Gorsuch and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The piece contends that despite bipartisan respect for his intellect and ethics, Tung's confirmation hearing was politicized by Democrats focusing on the author's social media posts. The article concludes by urging the Senate to confirm Tung, describing him as a committed constitutionalist who would be a valuable addition to the federal judiciary.</p>

          <p>A police officer, identified as 33-year-old David Rose, has died after being shot while responding to an incident near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta. The event involved a single shooter who is also deceased, and no other civilian injuries have been reported. The shooting prompted a lockdown at the CDC and a shelter-in-place alert at nearby Emory University. Officer Rose was a married father of two with a third child on the way. Authorities have since secured the area, stating there is no ongoing threat to the community.</p>

          <p>This opinion column critiques Steak 'n Shake's recent marketing strategy, which aligns the brand with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement by promoting ingredients like beef tallow and cane sugar. The author argues this is a cynical attempt to appeal to a specific political demographic to reverse the company's financial decline, which has seen 200 store closures since 2018. While acknowledging the potential culinary merits of the new ingredients, the article contends that the food remains unhealthy fast food. The piece predicts this political alignment may provide a short-term sales boost but will ultimately fail, as the novelty fades and the brand's underlying issues persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is undertaking a major upgrade of the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road, its primary land route to the contested Galwan Valley, to support the movement of tanks and missile launchers. In addition, a new 130km alternative route is nearing completion, aimed at reducing strategic vulnerability and providing more reliable access for troops and equipment. The infrastructure development is designed to enhance India's military readiness along the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border with China. This move is being closely watched by Beijing, as both nations continue to bolster their military capabilities in the strategically sensitive Himalayan region.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the Joe Biden administration was complicit in the starvation of Palestinians in Gaza by failing to act on early warnings from the UN and humanitarian groups. The author contends that despite clear evidence of Israel using starvation as a weapon of war, the Biden White House undermined aid organizations and continued unconditional military support. The piece points to specific instances, such as a State Department report that avoided concluding Israel had violated international law, as missed opportunities to leverage U.S. aid to prevent the crisis. The author concludes that this inaction has left a lasting stain on Biden's presidential legacy.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the FBI should refuse any requests to help Texas Republicans locate Democratic state lawmakers who have fled the state to block a partisan redistricting bill. The author asserts that the FBI's jurisdiction is limited to federal crimes and that intervening in this state-level political dispute would be a lawless expansion of its authority. The article warns that using a federal law enforcement agency to enforce the will of one political party is a dangerous step towards a police state. It calls on the FBI to uphold its institutional neutrality and avoid being drawn into a manifestly political fight, which is crucial for sustaining American democracy.</p>

          <p>The Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, once a vibrant symbol of the Palestinian diaspora, lies in ruins after years of Syrian civil war, with only a fraction of its population having returned. Volunteer engineers are assessing the catastrophic damage, but the slow pace of rebuilding is compounded by a lack of essential services and the sheer scale of the destruction. The war fractured the community and altered its relationship with the Syrian government, which once championed the Palestinian cause but also besieged the camp. With Syria's new authorities taking a different stance, former residents grapple with whether the camp can ever regain its identity or if home has become an even more distant concept.</p>

Volunteers patrol the parking lot, alert workers to the presence of agents, and hold rallies to pressure the store into refusing cooperation with ICE. The movement was sparked by recent raids at other locations, which critics argue violate a court order preventing agents from using racial profiling. This grassroots effort reflects a growing local resistance to the administration's immigration crackdown, with participants motivated by what they describe as the inhumane and unjust nature of the enforcement actions.</p>

The column also notes that California uses an independent commission for redistricting, unlike the partisan process in Texas.

This proposal faces strong opposition from the California Coastal Commission, which raises concerns about the environmental impact on wildlife and the effects of sonic booms on residents. The commission argues that most launches serve SpaceX's private Starlink venture and should be subject to state permits, not treated as exempt federal activity.

The loudspeakers have historically been a tool of psychological warfare, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news, and the North emitting noise.

Economists project that inflation will rise and the labor market may weaken, though a full recession is not widely anticipated.

Etiquette expert Elaine Swann suggests keeping visits to around four days, communicating plans in advance, and never assuming your host can provide transportation. Being told to "make yourself at home" is a cue for self-sufficiency, not a license to be messy or overly demanding. A thoughtful host gift, tidiness, and offering to help with chores are key to ensuring you get invited back, fostering the positive experience of staying with loved ones.</p>

The reported directive comes after Trump designated several Mexican cartels as terrorist entities. Mexican officials emphasized that any U.S. action would not involve military personnel in their territory and is not part of any bilateral agreement.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby. While an injury and coaching changes at the Jaguars were factors, his decision was also influenced by growing opportunities back in rugby, including a potential spot on the Wales national team and interest from a proposed rebel league. Experts suggest that despite his athleticism, the technical and tactical learning curve in the NFL was immense. Rees-Zammit is expected to return to rugby as a more mature player, with his experience praised as a brave chapter rather than a failure.</p>

Putin's goals likely include halting NATO expansion, securing a Russia-friendly government in Kyiv, and gaining permanent control over captured Ukrainian territories. The most significant points of contention will be Ukraine's future borders and its potential NATO membership, with Kyiv demanding full sovereignty and Moscow seeking territorial concessions.</p>
