          <p>The South Texas community near Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility has officially voted to become the city of Starbase, fulfilling Musk's ambition to create a company town. The vote tally was overwhelmingly in favor, with 212 votes for and 6 against, indicating strong support from the local residents, many of whom are SpaceX employees. Concerns have been raised about Musk's increased control over the area, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park during launches, as well as efforts to shift authority from the county to the new town's government. SpaceX aims to increase the number of South Texas launches from 5 to 25 per year, necessitating streamlined operations and beach closures for safety.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of common-law couples avoid legal marriage due to the country's law requiring married couples to share a surname. The rate is even higher among people in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing the surname issue as a deterrent. Advocates for separate surnames argue that the current law restricts individual choice and creates disadvantages for common-law couples regarding tax deductions and inheritance rights. The survey estimates that over one million people are in common-law relationships, with a significant portion desiring legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted.</p>

          <p>Katy Perry is facing criticism for her involvement in a Blue Origin spaceflight and perceived lack of authenticity, leading to online mockery and negative reviews of her recent performances. The pop star's "spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages" are seen as inconsistent with her professional choices, such as working with Dr. Luke, who has faced sexual assault allegations. Critics argue that Perry's pop persona feels outdated in comparison to newer artists who emphasize relatability and self-assurance. Despite the backlash, some fans have shown support, organizing a digital billboard message in Times Square.</p>
