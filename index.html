          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Federal Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 18:23:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump is considering a proposal to eliminate the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales, a move supporters claim would increase housing inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell. Currently, individuals can exclude up to $250,000 and joint filers up to $500,000 in gains, a limit unchanged since 1997. Critics argue that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit wealthy homeowners and could fuel speculation, potentially worsening housing affordability issues. The proposal aims to address the "stay-put penalty" that disincentivizes downsizing among seniors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives recessed early for its August break, a move Speaker Mike Johnson made to sidestep a vote on a bipartisan bill demanding the release of files related to deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein. This decision highlights the growing political pressure surrounding the issue, which has become a persistent controversy for the Trump administration. The House Oversight Committee has also voted to subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted Epstein associate, as the Justice Department seeks to interview her for more information on Epstein's clients. The situation has effectively stalled legislative business in the House.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue increasing 16% year-over-year to $4.45 billion. Despite the strong quarterly performance, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a disappointing forecast for the upcoming third quarter. The chipmaker projected third-quarter earnings and revenue with midpoints below what analysts had anticipated. As a key supplier of legacy semiconductors for the automotive and industrial sectors, its financial outlook is closely watched by the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its policy to bar transgender women from competing in women's categories for Team USA. The committee cited a February executive order from President Trump titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" as the basis for the change, stating its obligation as a federally chartered organization to comply with federal expectations. The revised policy emphasizes ensuring fair and safe competition for women but does not use the word "transgender" directly. Following the USOPC's decision, USA Fencing also updated its guidelines to align with the new rule.</p>

          <p>A verbal dispute at a Belleville, Illinois, McDonald's escalated into violence, resulting in a manager facing charges for allegedly shooting an employee's mother. The incident began when a teenage employee refused to take out the trash and was told to clock out. The teen's mother, Tynika McKinzie, arrived and allegedly assaulted the manager, Kathy Bledsoe, who then allegedly fired a handgun, striking McKinzie in the leg. Both women now face felony charges, with police lamenting the quick resort to violence to resolve a minor conflict.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the DOJ "does not tolerate rogue judges," signaling a direct conflict between the administration and the judiciary over the appointment.

          <p>Shares of struggling department store Kohl's soared by nearly 38% as it became the latest target of a "meme stock" rally driven by retail investors on social media forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets. This phenomenon, reminiscent of the 2021 GameStop surge, involves investors piling into heavily shorted stocks, often disconnected from the company's underlying financial health. Kohl's has been facing weak sales and recently fired its CEO, making its sudden stock jump a classic example of meme-driven market volatility.

To meet international regulatory deadlines and prevent the loss of its secured orbits and radio frequencies, the company needs to launch hundreds of satellites within the next few years.

Sciver-Brunt, who was known for her passionate on-field demeanor, contrasted her own "life and death" approach to the game with what she perceives as a lack of outward fight in the current squad.

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to name Gita O’Neill, a career city attorney, as its new interim chief executive. O'Neill will guide the agency through a significant downsizing over the next year, as Los Angeles County is creating its own homelessness department and will reclaim about 40% of LAHSA's budget. The leadership change follows a period of intense criticism and multiple audits that found poor financial oversight and contract management within the agency. O'Neill's appointment is scheduled for a vote on Friday, the same day the current CEO departs.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), was created as part of a major bill recently signed into law by President Trump. This income-driven plan, available by July 2026, will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings with a $10 minimum. Unlike previous plans, RAP will offer loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than the typical 20-25 years. After it is introduced, RAP and the standard repayment plan will be the only two options available for new borrowers.</p>

However, the market for exits—where investors realize their returns through acquisitions or IPOs—tells a different story, with only $36 billion in total exit value during the same period. This indicates that while vast sums are being invested, profitable returns remain comparatively scarce. (not investment advice)</p>

The potential conflict arises because the property where the pyrotechnics company operated is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant and his wife, who also works for the Sheriff's Office. The explosion and fire occurred on July 1 at a warehouse in Esparto where victims were reportedly packaging fireworks. The state fire marshal is leading the probe into the cause of the fatal industrial accident.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests President Donald Trump's unusually high volume of erratic posts on Truth Social indicates a defensive reaction to the persistent news coverage of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Over one weekend, Trump posted dozens of times, sharing AI-generated images of political rivals in prison and seemingly random viral videos. This behavior is interpreted as a sign of frustration and an attempt to distract from a scandal that he has been unable to control, even among his allies. The article posits that Trump's posting style reflects his perceived level of power and control over the political narrative.</p>

In an accompanying memo, Gabbard alleged the files show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to undermine Donald Trump, and she plans a criminal referral to the DOJ. Democrats have fiercely contested this interpretation, accusing Gabbard of misrepresenting intelligence to fit a political narrative and noting that multiple bipartisan reviews have confirmed Russia's influence campaign.
