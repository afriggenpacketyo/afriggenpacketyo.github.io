          <p>The Canadian government has forced an end to a strike by Air Canada flight attendants, mandating a return to work and binding arbitration just 12 hours after the stoppage began. The intervention, which the government cited as necessary to protect the economy, has stranded over 100,000 travelers during the peak summer season. The union has accused the government of violating their constitutional right to strike, arguing that the move unfairly benefits Air Canada by halting negotiations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire is complicating efforts to end the war. This comes as former U.S. President Donald Trump, following a summit with Vladimir Putin, has shifted his position to advocate for a direct peace agreement, bypassing a ceasefire. Trump is expected to press Zelensky on a deal, which reportedly involves Ukraine ceding territory, a proposal that has raised concerns among European allies and in Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully captured a serial killer responsible for two murders in the 1990s through an elaborate undercover sting at a Chili's restaurant. The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, was lured to a meeting under the guise of a job offer. Investigators covertly collected his DNA from a water glass, which provided a definitive match to evidence from the crime scenes, finally solving the decades-old "canal murders" case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a ban on exporting certain AI chips, announcing a new policy that allows companies like Nvidia and AMD to sell to China in exchange for sharing 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move, described as a "revenue-sharing" agreement, has sparked criticism from trade experts who warn it sets a dangerous precedent of selling export control licenses, potentially compromising national security. The legality of what critics call an export tax is also being questioned, with the Commerce Department still finalizing the details. (not investment advice)</p>

This presentation comes into direct conflict with Ukraine's position, as Kyiv's Ministry of Culture has declared Repin's works to be part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition underscores the ongoing cultural and diplomatic friction between Russia and Ukraine, with China's framing of the artist siding with the Russian narrative.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched peacefully in Washington D.C. to protest former President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" and the subsequent deployment of National Guard troops in the city. Protesters gathered at DuPont Circle before moving toward the White House, chanting against what they called a "fascist takeover" and federal overreach. The demonstration followed a successful legal challenge by the D.C. Attorney General that blocked the administration's attempt to install a federally controlled "emergency police commissioner" to lead the city's police force.</p>

          <p>Chinese merchants who sell goods on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain worried about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on their businesses. Despite a current truce in trade hostilities, policy uncertainty is a significant concern for sellers who rely on the large American market. One electronics company noted that it had to suspend its U.S. operations for nearly two months earlier in the year when bilateral trade relations soured, highlighting the vulnerability of these businesses to geopolitical tensions.

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C. as part of a federal public safety operation may be armed. While stating that the troops are not currently making arrests, the official noted that being armed is consistent with their mission to protect federal assets and deter crime. This clarification represents a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated that weapons would be available but stored in an armory, raising further concerns among residents protesting the increased military presence in the city.</p>
