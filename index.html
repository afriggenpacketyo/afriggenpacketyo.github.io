          <p>Energy experts suggest the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax bill could significantly impede decarbonization efforts in the United States by phasing out or repealing Biden-era clean energy tax credits, potentially jeopardizing up to 330,000 jobs and increasing electricity bills for families and businesses by $51 billion. Republican senators have voiced concerns that repealing these credits could disrupt their states, which have benefited from clean energy manufacturing investments. Environmental policy experts also worry about provisions allowing polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee. The bill is now under review in the Senate, where revisions are expected.

          <p>The White House has rejected a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stating that the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act by blocking $5 billion in spending on electric vehicle charging stations from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, leading to project delays. Budget Director Russ Vought dismissed the GAO's findings, arguing that they hinder effective taxpayer dollar management. Senator Patty Murray criticized Trump's actions, asserting Congress's constitutional power of the purse. The GAO is investigating 39 other potential impoundment instances under the Trump administration, with several states already suing over the paused EV charging funds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university alleging First Amendment and due process violations. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and fostered an unsafe environment for Jewish students, while Harvard President Alan Gerber stated the university did respond as required. The lawsuit accuses the administration of retaliatory attacks due to policy disagreements, impacting over 7,000 international students.

          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of all scheduled concerts up to early July 2026 due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition causing problems with hearing, vision, and balance.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in women with dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound, and can find smaller tumors than regular mammography. While MRI is also effective, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely available. The study, conducted across 10 sites in the United Kingdom, involved over 9,000 women and found that contrast-enhanced mammography detected 19.2 cancers per 1,000 exams, compared to 4.2 with ultrasound. The FDA has not approved contrast-enhanced mammography for screening.</p>

Apple has resisted pressure to move its supply chain, shifting production to countries like India and Vietnam instead of the U.S. Experts suggest that making iPhones in the United States would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling iPhone prices. Apple's move to India was primarily to avoid local taxes on imported iPhones, but the company still relies heavily on China for component assembly.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill that includes significant spending cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially affecting millions of Americans. The legislation proposes slashing Medicaid by roughly $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion, which could lead to many losing benefits. These cuts are intended to offset the costs of tax perks included in the bill, but critics argue that they will disproportionately impact low-income individuals and families. The bill now awaits consideration in the Senate, where its future is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn following President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all declined, reflecting investor concerns about renewed trade tensions. Trump's proposals included a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S. and a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union. These announcements led to declines in European markets as well, with analysts anticipating continued market volatility due to upcoming tariff-related deadlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily allowing President Trump to fire certain federal officials but signaled it would not extend this authority to members of the Federal Reserve. This decision suggests the Court recognizes the importance of the Fed's independence in setting interest rates based on economic calculations, not political considerations. The order stems from a case challenging the president's power to fire officials at independent agencies, reflecting a broader debate about the "unitary executive" theory. The ruling indicates a potential limit to presidential control over previously independent parts of the federal government.</p>

          <p>A report suggesting the Trump administration is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from South Korea has sparked anxiety in the country, especially amid an upcoming presidential election. The plan involves potentially moving around 4,500 troops to other locations in the Indo-Pacific region, including Guam. Fears of a U.S. troop withdrawal have been present since Trump's first term, when he demanded Seoul pay more for the upkeep of U.S. forces. The report has reignited discussions about South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons and has become a point of contention in the presidential race.</p>
