          <p>England has called up fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton for the decisive fifth Test against India at The Oval. The move provides cover for a pace attack that was left exhausted after spending 143 overs in the field during the previous match. Captain Ben Stokes indicated a need for "fresh legs" for the series finale, which begins on a tight turnaround. Overton joins Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue as the other pace bowlers available in the squad.</p>

This is not the first time Shi has faced scrutiny, having been cleared of similar allegations in 2015.

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is anticipated to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase in a consultative vote, increasing the likelihood of strikes later this year.

While the government insists it cannot move further on headline pay, it remains open to talks on wider structural reforms. The union is demanding further negotiations to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn.</p>

The artifact, which dates to between 2055 and 1650 BC, offers a direct and personal connection to the ancient Egyptians who created these objects.

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the Illinois landlord convicted of murdering a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and wounding his mother, has died in prison. Czuba was serving a 53-year sentence for the October 2023 attack, which prosecutors proved was a hate crime motivated by the victims' Islamic faith and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. He was found guilty of murder and attempted murder in the stabbing death of Wadee Alfayoumi. The attack had renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automakers Face Lingering Threats Despite US Tariff Relief</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade deal lowering U.S. tariffs offers only minor relief to Japanese automakers, who face more significant long-term threats. The industry's primary challenge is the meteoric rise of Chinese competitors, who are eroding Japan's market share in key regions like Southeast Asia and Australia. Combined with domestic economic weakness and structural issues, companies like Nissan are particularly vulnerable. While the tariff deal provides some predictability, the competitive pressure from China is reshaping the global automotive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than 70 years of scientific research and planning, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in southern Tibet. The groundbreaking for what is set to be the world's most powerful dam was announced by Premier Li Qiang. The project's origins trace back to the first comprehensive scientific expeditions to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which began in 1951. The massive dam has been a subject of geopolitical and environmental concern for decades due to its location and scale.</p>
