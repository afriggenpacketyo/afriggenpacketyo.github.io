          <p>Following two days of unrest in Los Angeles sparked by ICE raids, President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen to the city. The protests, which began outside the Los Angeles Federal Building, escalated as residents clashed with law enforcement in the Paramount district, leading to the use of tear gas and flash bangs. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of sowing terror. Trump responded by stating that the federal government would intervene if state officials could not maintain order, reflecting the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in the region. Optimism is low considering the escalation and political divide.</p>

          <p>The disappearance of Jermain Charlo in June 2018 remains unsolved, with investigators still actively pursuing leads. Charlo was last seen at a bar in Missoula, Montana, and subsequent investigation has focused on her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, due to inconsistencies in his statements regarding her whereabouts. Cellphone data placed Charlo's phone near DeFrance's residence after her disappearance, and he later admitted to discarding the phone in Idaho. Despite extensive searches and investigation, Charlo has not been found, and DeFrance has never been named a suspect in her disappearance. The family continues to seek answers and closure in this case.</p>

          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in the opening game of the NCAA super regionals, bringing them one step closer to the College World Series.

Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning provided a crucial cushion, and freshman Easton Hawk closed out the game to earn the save. The Bruins' ability to capitalize on hits and walks, coupled with solid defense, propelled them to victory in this tightly contested match.</p>

          <p>Riley Gaines, host of the "Gaines for Girls" podcast, has responded to criticism from Simone Biles after Gaines commented on a transgender pitcher's success in a high school softball championship. Biles called Gaines "truly sick" and accused her of bullying transgender athletes, while Gaines defended her position, arguing that it is her job to advocate for women's sports. Gaines also addressed Biles' comments about her loss to Lia Thomas, a trans swimmer, and highlighted what she sees as a contradiction in Biles' support for transgender athletes given her own experiences with sexual abuse by Larry Nassar. The debate reflects broader tensions surrounding the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has reportedly deteriorated, with Trump allegedly referring to Musk as a "big-time drug addict" and expressing disapproval of Musk's physical altercation with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The tensions stem from disagreements over government spending and appointments, leading to Musk's alienation from key White House staff. The falling out culminated in Musk's critical posts on X, after Trump declined to nominate Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator, signaling a significant rupture between the two influential figures.</p>
