          <h2>UK National Archives Reveal Concerns Over Blair-Era Designer Clothing Discounts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:20:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly released documents from the UK National Archives show that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received significant discounts on designer clothing, totaling tens of thousands of pounds. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair paid just £31,000 for items valued at over £75,000. The files reveal that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and potential breach of the ministerial code, advising the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts. It remains unclear from the documents whether this repayment occurred, though the Blairs' institute states that advice was sought and followed.</p>

          <h2>UK Rental Costs Have Surged by an Average of £221 Per Month Over Three Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has increased by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This rise is attributed to high demand and a shortage of available rental properties, forcing some tenants to turn down job opportunities or relocate. While the rate of increase is now slowing, particularly in major cities, areas adjacent to them are still experiencing sharp rises. The significant increase in rental costs is making it increasingly difficult for many to save for a home deposit, despite a relative stagnation in house prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Images Suggest China's J-35 Stealth Fighter is Nearing Naval Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 stealth fighter jet provide strong evidence that the aircraft is ready for production and naval service. The images clearly show the jets with "Chinese navy" markings and "Flying Shark" insignia, along with official serial numbers, suggesting they are part of an initial production run. According to a former People's Liberation Army instructor, these details indicate the fifth-generation fighter has been formally integrated into the navy's carrier aviation force. This development signals that the J-35 is approaching operational readiness for deployment on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian.</p>

          <p>The family of Keith McAllister, a 61-year-old man who died after a tragic accident involving an MRI machine on Long Island, alleges that a technician was at fault. McAllister was accompanying his wife for a scan when the technician reportedly invited him into the room to assist, without warning him about the machine's powerful magnetic field. A metal chain he was wearing caused him to be pulled into the machine, where he remained stuck for nearly an hour before being freed. He later died from multiple heart attacks following the incident, and the family is now raising funds for funeral expenses while the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 individuals from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The court ruled that while an advocacy group's lawsuit against the termination has merit, there was insufficient evidence to block the policy while the case is litigated. This decision puts thousands of TPS holders, who were granted protection due to unsafe conditions in their home countries, at risk of deportation. Advocacy groups have expressed alarm, warning that lives will be upended and allies could be forced into hiding or deported to dangerous situations.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Trump of attempting to distract the public from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files by posting about a wide range of unrelated topics. Recent social media posts from the president have included demands for the Washington Commanders to revert to their old name and attacks on political opponents. This flurry of activity follows a Department of Justice announcement that it would not release additional Epstein files, a reversal that has angered some of his supporters. Political opponents and commentators suggest these moves are a deliberate strategy to shift the narrative away from the Epstein case and the administration's handling of it.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they have a potential positive side effect. The tariffs are exposing the self-defeating internal trade barriers that nations like Canada, China, and the European Union have maintained for years. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is compelling these countries to confront and dismantle their own long-standing domestic barriers to trade and commerce. This process of internal reform could unlock significant economic potential, potentially offsetting the negative impact of the tariffs and leading to more liberalized and efficient global economies.

The White House press secretary stated that due to the Journal's "fake and defamatory conduct," it would not be one of the outlets covering the trip.

This sharp revision in numbers is common after large-scale disasters, as initial reports are often chaotic.

This prospect raises concerns for computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping, similar to the Y2K problem. Interestingly, scientists note that the melting of polar ice due to climate change has slightly counteracted this acceleration, delaying the potential need for this unprecedented measure.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet has crashed into a school campus in a suburb of the capital, Dhaka, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people and injuring over 170. The F-7 jet reportedly experienced a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff before slamming into a two-story building at the Milestone School and College. The pilot, who was among the deceased, had attempted to navigate the failing aircraft to a less populated area, according to the armed forces. Eyewitnesses, including students and teachers, described a horrific scene of fire and smoke as the plane hit the building near the end of the school day when many parents were present.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration is using the judiciary to advance its agenda, leading to a significant shift in the balance of power. Having reshaped the Supreme Court, the administration is now in frequent conflict with lower federal courts, with the president often using inflammatory rhetoric against judges who rule against his policies. This has led to an unprecedented number of threats against the judiciary. By relying heavily on executive orders and challenging court injunctions, the administration is testing the limits of presidential authority. Some legal experts fear this approach constitutes a grave assault on democracy and is permanently altering the system of checks and balances.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Department of Justice to investigate what it calls "illegal DEI practices" at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The complaint alleges the university systematically uses race and identity-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, violating civil rights laws and the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The group claims Johns Hopkins uses socioeconomic status as a proxy for race and that its diversity-focused programs compromise medical competence. The complaint calls for a federal investigation and the suspension of funding for programs deemed discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Although his 10 shots did not strike anyone, he was convicted of using excessive force. The judge's sentence was significantly harsher than the one-day term recommended by the Trump-led Justice Department, a position that drew criticism from Taylor's family. Hankison is the only officer to be convicted and sentenced to prison in direct connection with the raid, which became a focal point of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

The letter follows revelations from Lionesses defender Jess Carter that she has been a target of racist abuse online throughout the recent tournament.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues that Donald Trump's presidency is not guided by a coherent policy belief but is instead animated by anger, vengefulness, and small-minded pettiness. The article cites several examples, including renaming military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event for a rescue dog, and pressuring the Federal Reserve chairman, as evidence of a culture of retribution. It posits that even major foreign policy decisions, such as a recent shift on aid to Ukraine, are driven by emotional reactions to being slighted rather than strategic thinking. The author concludes this focus on grievances creates a capricious and unstable form of governance.</p>

According to correspondence, the Defense Department approved a DHS request for immediate access to Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey through September 2025. This move is part of the Trump administration's push to increase arrests and detentions amid a shortage of bed space in existing facilities. The plan calls for space for up to 1,000 people at each of the new sites and doubling capacity at Guantanamo.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Emil Bove, President Trump's most controversial judicial nominee, as a symbol of a new phase in the administration's reshaping of the federal courts. During his first term, Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. Now, with the nominations process restarting, Bove's potential appointment to the federal bench is seen as a significant development. The piece suggests that his nomination represents a shift and raises questions about the future direction and criteria for judicial appointments under the current administration, moving beyond the traditional conservative legal movement's framework.</p>

That earlier lawsuit was voluntarily dropped by Trump shortly after the judge, Darrin Gayles, scheduled a deposition for the president. The assignment of Judge Gayles raises the possibility that Trump will again face a deposition under oath, where he could be questioned about his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Legal commentators are divided on whether Trump will proceed with the case or withdraw to avoid such questioning.</p>
