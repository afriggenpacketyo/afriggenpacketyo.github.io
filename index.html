          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for a summit in Alaska, where Trump hand-delivered a letter from Melania Trump concerning Ukrainian children abducted during the war. During the talks, Putin reportedly demanded that Ukraine withdraw from the entire Donetsk region in exchange for halting offensives in other areas. Following the meeting, which did not result in a formal deal, it was announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would travel to Washington D.C. to meet with Trump. European leaders responded by reiterating that Ukraine must have strong security guarantees and that international borders should not be altered by force.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, becoming the first of the Atlantic season with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. The storm is currently moving west near the Leeward Islands, where it is expected to bring heavy rain and potential flash flooding to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands over the weekend. While most meteorological models predict Erin will remain offshore, its path between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast is projected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to 27. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for significant beach erosion and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to apply greater scrutiny to the "good moral character" requirement for immigrants seeking naturalization. New policy guidance instructs officers to conduct a "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal background check, placing more emphasis on positive contributions like community involvement and stable employment. The directive also mandates stricter evaluation of negative factors, including actions that are lawful but deemed inconsistent with civic responsibility, such as habitual traffic infractions. Critics argue this move is designed to create more grounds for denial and discourage legal immigrants from applying for citizenship.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, with their three children. This move is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" for the family following a challenging period that included Catherine's cancer diagnosis and treatment. Sources indicate they view Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home," where they intend to live even after Prince William becomes King. The couple will fund the move and any renovations privately, paying market rent for the property and continuing their focus on maintaining a private family life without live-in staff.</p>

His "X-WING" shelters, developed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyards. These units, which can be constructed in just one week, provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to the affordable housing crisis. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex made from shipping containers, aimed at providing housing for low-income and unhoused senior citizens.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests saw a 13% decrease in July compared to June, a slowdown in the Trump administration's promised deportation efforts. While ICE officials cite the need for more resources, activists believe their resistance tactics are having an effect. In Oregon, for example, a "rapid response" hotline run by non-profits helps connect arrestees with legal aid, sometimes filing habeas corpus petitions before they can be transported to out-of-state detention facilities. The state's "sanctuary" law, which limits cooperation between local and federal authorities, further complicates ICE operations, contributing to lower arrest numbers in the region.</p>

Thompson clocked a swift 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second with a time of 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year prior. Despite the head-to-head victory, Thompson downplayed its significance, stating he primarily competes against himself, while Lyles viewed his performance as a positive step toward the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone.

          <p>This analysis article suggests that Donald Trump's apparent pivot from demanding an immediate ceasefire to prioritizing a comprehensive peace agreement will cause significant dismay in Kyiv. This shift aligns with Russia's long-held position, which implies that any settlement must account for its strategic interests, effectively requiring Ukrainian capitulation. By endorsing this approach, Trump has seemingly undone a week of European diplomatic efforts aimed at influencing the summit's outcome. The move buys time for Vladimir Putin on the battlefield and undermines Ukraine's core demand that an unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward peace.</p>

This technology involves placing large solar power facilities in orbit to convert solar energy into electricity, which is then transmitted to Earth via microwaves or lasers. Unlike ground-based solar plants, space stations offer a continuous and more intense source of energy, unaffected by weather or nighttime. The academic argued that China's current research, led by universities, lacks the capacity for such a complex systems project and requires a more centralized, top-down national strategy.</p>

Putin reiterated his long-standing demands for a new European security balance reflecting Russian interests, effectively offering no path to peace.

Fearing similar state retaliation, at least nine other districts have proactively removed books, including classics by Maya Angelou and Kurt Vonnegut.

          <p>Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney saved Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre in Orefield, Pennsylvania, the oldest operating drive-in in the world, from being sold to developers. To purchase the historic theater, the couple used their life savings and a $1 million small business loan. After taking over in 2022, they have worked to modernize the business by operating year-round and hosting community events like craft fairs and trunk-or-treats to boost revenue. Their efforts have paid off, with the theater becoming profitable in 2024, bringing in nearly $550,000 in revenue and ensuring the preservation of a beloved piece of film history.</p>

          <h2>Fewer Young Adults Achieving Traditional Milestones Due to Economic and Social Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:39:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Census Bureau report indicates that young adults aged 25 to 34 are achieving key life milestones, such as moving out, getting a job, marrying, and having children, at a much lower rate than previous generations. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had met all four milestones, but that figure has dropped to less than a quarter today. Researchers attribute this dramatic shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over traditional family milestones like marriage, which is increasingly viewed as a capstone rather than a foundation of adulthood.</p>

          <p>The ceremonial and warm welcome that Vladimir Putin received from Donald Trump in Alaska has been met with shock and disappointment in Ukraine. Ukrainians watching the summit expressed frustration over the optics, which included a red carpet, a military flypast, and friendly gestures for a leader they consider a war criminal responsible for immense suffering. Analysts and citizens alike felt the pomp was inappropriate and served to legitimize Putin on the global stage without achieving any substantive progress toward peace. The spectacle reinforced Ukrainian fears that Trump could be easily influenced by Putin, undermining their country's position.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has praised Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts, stating they have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before," despite the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin not yielding a ceasefire deal. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that the UK's support for Ukraine remains unwavering. He also welcomed the U.S. and European willingness to provide robust security guarantees as part of a potential agreement. His comments came after a series of calls with Western allies following the high-profile meeting between Trump and Putin.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's share declined. This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which are gaining traction and positive attention for their durability and new form factors. While Apple still leads the market, its lack of design innovation in recent years has created an opening for competitors. Analysts predict Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete with Samsung's growing influence and higher-priced premium devices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A selfie shared on the encrypted EncroChat network was the crucial mistake that led to the capture of fugitive crime boss Jamie Rothwell. While running a multi-million-pound drug and gun trafficking operation from his apartment in Barcelona, Rothwell sent a picture of himself in a mirror, which, combined with photos of his apartment's view, allowed police to identify and locate him. The EncroChat network, once trusted by criminals, was secretly hacked by law enforcement, exposing thousands of private conversations. Rothwell was extradited to the UK and sentenced to 43 years in prison for a range of offenses.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and her former bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, have been federally charged with fraud and corruption. Prosecutors allege the two were engaged in an intimate relationship and misused public funds to facilitate it, including by having Vappie claim he was on duty during personal activities and trips. The indictment claims they spent time together at a city-owned apartment and took personal trips, costing taxpayers over $70,000, while Vappie was being paid for protection work. Both are also accused of intimidating subordinates and lying to FBI agents and a grand jury to conceal their activities.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Shares Three Steps to Cultivate Greater Emotional Endurance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to build emotional endurance, which is the ability to manage stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. First, she advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-uncomfortable space between not knowing and knowing. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe struggles as part of the process rather than a sign of failure. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body that it can tolerate discomfort and build resilience.</p>
