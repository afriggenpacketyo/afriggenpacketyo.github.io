          <p>The Trump administration has imposed economic sanctions on three Mexican nationals and two Mexico-based entities linked to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, targeting their fuel theft network. Cesar Morfin Morfin, accused of transporting fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana into the United States, is among those sanctioned. US officials released an image of a jaguar allegedly seized from Morfin by Mexican authorities. The sanctions aim to disrupt the cartel's financial resources and combat the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States, which has been blamed for numerous overdose deaths.

          <p>Despite the Twenty-Second Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms, Donald Trump has mused about the possibility of running for a third term in 2028. Trump has suggested that there are "methods" to circumvent the constitutional prohibition. The article explores historical precedents, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented third and fourth terms, and examines potential legal challenges to Trump's ambitions. The article also references the idea that Trump could run for Vice President and then ascend to the presidency through a resignation, however, this would be against the constitution.

          <p>A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that semaglutide, sold under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, may effectively treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition linked to obesity and diabetes. The research, involving approximately 800 patients over 72 weeks, demonstrated significant improvements in liver health among those receiving semaglutide. The article notes that MASH can lead to severe complications like liver scarring and failure, and there has been no FDA-approved treatment for this condition. While longer-term studies are needed, these findings suggest a potential new application for these widely used medications. Optimism Score: 75</p>

          <p>The Tony Award nominations reflect a season divided by mavericks and mega-stars, with the mavericks faring considerably better. Three new musicals, “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Death Becomes Her,” and “Maybe Happy Ending,” tied for the most nominations with 10 each. The race for best play also features five contenders, including “English” and “Purpose.” The article also notes that Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Nick Jonas, David Hyde Pierce and Idina Menzel failed to get nods from the nominators.
