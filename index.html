          <h2>Suffolk County, NY, Enacts Law to Penalize Convicted Animal Abusers Who Own Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 03:07:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a crime for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The new law establishes a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine, for those on the county's convicted animal abuser registry who are found to own pets. This expands upon a 2010 law that created the registry, requiring convicted abusers to register their information. The legislation aims to close a loophole by providing penalties for violating the existing prohibition on pet ownership for convicted abusers, ensuring consequences for those who disregard the law and further protecting animals in the county. The expanded law comes after dozens of dead cats were found in a Long Island home, highlighting the need for stronger animal protection measures.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy is considered a strong favorite to win the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course where he has enjoyed considerable success. McIlroy has won multiple times at Quail Hollow, including victories in 2021 and 2024, and feels comfortable with the course's layout and conditions. The course setup for the PGA Championship is expected to be more challenging than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens. McIlroy's confidence is high, and he has positive memories at the venue, making him a top contender for the major championship, with weather forecasts predicting a soft golf course to put an even greater premium on length off the tee.</p>

          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Sparked by a train station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16 people due to suspected corruption, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in Serbia to date. The movement is characterized by solidarity and inclusion, demonstrated when Muslim students from Novi Pazar relieved Orthodox Christian protesters blocking the national broadcaster over Easter. Despite government attempts to undermine the protests, including offering loans to young people and inducing the prime minister to resign, the movement continues to gain momentum, calling for early elections.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group, has announced its decision to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey, marking a potential end to a four-decade-long armed conflict. The announcement, made by the Firat News Agency, follows calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to convene a congress and formally decide to disband. The PKK had led an armed insurgency since 1984, resulting in tens of thousands of lives lost. The group stated that its struggle had achieved its historical mission of bringing the Kurdish issue to a point of resolution through democratic politics.</p>

          <p>Sugar overconsumption can trigger addiction-like behaviors by altering neuronal pathways in the brain, impacting dopamine signaling and stress-related pathways. While it's debated whether sugar is truly addictive, its overconsumption is linked to serious health issues like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, and even neurological disorders. Emotional stress and challenging early life experiences can contribute to sugar cravings and potential addiction, making it essential to understand these patterns. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and nutritional strategies like gradually reducing added sugars and increasing protein and fiber intake. Governments should also increase the availability of healthy food and decrease the excessive publicity of ultra-processed foods.</p>

          <p>Kenbishi, Japan's oldest sake brand, remains steadfast in its commitment to traditional brewing methods despite the sake industry facing declining domestic consumption. Brewing takes place during the winter season, with 60 brewers staying onsite for six months, consuming around 1,500 bottles of sake, as tradition is everything. Kenbishi uses traditional wooden equipment, like the "dakidaru," to maintain essential temperatures, arguing that only wood can ensure the unchanging taste of its sake. While many seek to capitalize on growing interest in sake overseas, Kenbishi sees the UNESCO heritage listing of traditional sake-brewing techniques as an opportunity for people in Japan to rediscover sake.</p>

China has become a significant purchaser of resources from Latin America, while Chinese products have filled markets in the region, and investments have funded infrastructure projects.

The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which could lead to 8.6 million fewer people with healthcare over the next decade.

          <p>Hamas has announced the imminent release of Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli citizen held hostage since October 7, 2023, as part of ongoing efforts to establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The release is intended to facilitate the reopening of crossings into Gaza and the resumption of aid delivery. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office acknowledged Hamas' plan, stating it was informed by the U.S. and that the move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of remaining hostages. President Trump expressed gratitude for the efforts of mediators, while the Alexander family voiced hope that this release would pave the way for the freedom of all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Jens Hölscher is seeking an apology from Sussex PC Christopher Corker three years after his son, Arthur Hölscher-Ermert, was killed after being hit by a police patrol car. PC Corker was accused of causing death by dangerous driving, but charges were dropped by the CPS. Mr. Hölscher has expressed his disappointment that he has received no apology or communication from Sussex Police or PC Corker. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said PC Corker, and another officer who was in the car at the time of the crash both face gross misconduct hearings for potential breaches of the police standards of professional behavior.</p>

          <p>The recent trade talks between China and the US in Geneva are seen as carrying both economic and political significance, offering interim relief to both powers without appearing weak on the trade war front. Negotiators agreed to establish a "trade consultation mechanism," signaling a potential path toward addressing tariffs and other trade barriers. However, analysts emphasize that the US is under political pressure to show wins, while China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience. Beijing's behavior suggests a plan rooted in strategic patience and economic self-preservation.</p>

The visit occurs as antisemitism has risen sharply, particularly among young people in Germany, since the start of the Gaza war.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "substantial progress," but a joint statement from both countries is expected to clarify the details.
