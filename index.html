          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended by the Labour Party for a second time, triggering an internal investigation into comments she made about racism. Abbott defended her 2023 remarks, which differentiated racism experienced by people of color from prejudice faced by Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers, by stating that skin color makes racism immediately visible. Despite previously apologizing, her recent reiteration of this stance in a BBC interview led to her suspension, forcing her to sit as an independent MP. Abbott, the longest-serving female MP in the Commons, expressed her belief that the Labour leadership is actively trying to remove her from the party.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the April Pahalgam attack in India that killed 26 people, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified TRF as a "front and proxy" of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a UN-designated terrorist group. India welcomed this decision as a "strong affirmation" of its counter-terrorism cooperation with the US, viewing it as a sign of deepening support. The move follows a major escalation of hostilities between India and Pakistan after the attack, and Washington's commitment to justice for the victims remains firm.</p>

          <h2>Germany Resumes Deportations of Afghan Nationals with Criminal Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 03:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has resumed deportations of Afghan nationals, sending 81 individuals with criminal records back to their home country on a flight from Leipzig airport. This marks the first such repatriation effort under Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government, which aims to increase removals of rejected asylum-seekers, particularly those who have a criminal record or pose a threat. The German Interior Ministry confirmed these "legally required" deportations implement a key coalition agreement. This policy shift signals a tougher stance on migration, despite Berlin not officially recognizing the Taliban government currently in power in Afghanistan, and is a major pillar of Merz's campaign.</p>

          <p>China's education ministry has issued a warning to Chinese students considering studying in the Philippines, citing unstable public security and frequent crimes targeting Chinese nationals. This advisory comes amid escalating territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where Manila recently accused a Chinese ship of damaging protected coral near Thitu Island. The warning reflects growing safety concerns for Chinese citizens and strained diplomatic relations between Beijing and Manila, with the Philippines increasingly aligning with its treaty ally, Washington. The ministry urged students to "carefully assess security risks" before traveling to the Southeast Asian nation.</p>

          <p>India's Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) has temporarily blocked high-frequency trading firm Jane Street Group, accusing it of large-scale market manipulation. Jane Street disputes this, claiming its actions were "basic index arbitrage trading," which involves exploiting price differences between markets. Experts suggest the distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal manipulation hinges on intent and market impact, particularly whether a firm intentionally distorts prices in less liquid markets for profit, as SEBI alleges in the Nifty 50 index. This case spotlights vulnerabilities in India's market structure and raises questions about regulatory oversight in complex trading strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Personal Reflection on Turning 35: Embracing Life's Uncertainties and Impermanence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A personal essay reflects on turning 35 and the profound realization that adulthood often involves "winging it" rather than achieving a state of complete self-assuredness. The author draws parallels with a French comedy show, "Bref," which depicts a character's evolving life cycles, noting how life's themes deepen with age. The article explores complex themes of identity, particularly as an immigrant navigating dual cultural references, and the continuous process of becoming. It emphasizes the importance of nurturing relationships, accepting failures, and remaining open to unexpected experiences, even amidst a world facing significant global challenges.</p>

          <p>A Chinese farmer from Anhui province, Zhang, has successfully built a 7-meter submarine, fulfilling a lifelong dream of invention. Inspired by a CCTV program in 2014, he scraped together 5,000 yuan (US$700) to buy steel plates, a battery, and an engine, constructing the vessel secretly while his wife was away. Villagers were astonished as his sleek black submarine sliced through the water with a low mechanical growl. This remarkable feat highlights individual ingenuity and resourcefulness in rural China, transforming a lifelong fascination into a tangible, working creation that defies conventional expectations.</p>

          <p>Chinese economists are advocating for more pro-market reforms to address economic imbalances and intense intra-industry competition, following a decline in the country's marketisation index. The National Economic Research Institute reported China's overall marketisation level dropped to 5.62 out of 10 in 2023, a significant decrease from its 2021 peak. The largest deterioration was observed in government-market relations, indicating increased government intervention and a reduced proportion of resources allocated by the market. Experts emphasize the urgent need to reverse this trend to foster a healthier and more efficient economic environment for sustained growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A personal account details a man's arduous 1.5-year journey to a diagnosis of invasive Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare skin cancer often misdiagnosed. Initially dismissed as a common itch, the condition worsened through multiple treatments and doctor visits until he insisted on a biopsy, a decision that "changed everything." His experience highlights the challenges of diagnosing rare diseases, the complexities of navigating the healthcare system with minimal inter-hospital communication, and the critical importance of patient advocacy.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high of 3.7%, aligning with economists' expectations, partly due to a slight easing in rice price inflation, which had seen rapid increases. However, the overall inflation rate remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. Economists note persistent inflationary pressures, particularly for unsubsidized items, and potential risks from yen depreciation and looming US tariffs. While a slight moderation is expected, the central bank's future policy and upcoming Upper House elections add to market uncertainty, with forecasts predicting modest GDP growth.

          <p>The Atlantic questions CBS's assertion that the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is "purely a financial decision," despite Colbert's consistent top ratings. The article suggests the move aligns with a pattern of CBS capitulating to President Trump, a frequent target of Colbert's criticism, especially as Paramount Global seeks federal approval for a merger. It highlights the departure of a respected 60 Minutes chief and a $16 million settlement with Trump, raising concerns about CBS's journalistic independence and legacy. This decision is seen as a strategic maneuver to preserve a deal, potentially at the expense of editorial integrity.</p>

Watters, while offering a partial apology for misunderstanding Newsom's social media post, maintained the governor's tweet was "confusing and unclear."

He emphasized the importance of greater European defense independence as the US shifts focus to Asia.

The group, which documented abuses for 25 years, accuses Bukele's administration of legal harassment, espionage, and defamation campaigns, with the arrest of anti-corruption program leader Ruth López being a "breaking point." This departure contributes to an exodus of journalists and activists, as Bukele's crackdown on crime, while reducing violence, has also led to mass incarcerations and widespread human rights violations, prompting concerns about democratic backsliding.</p>
