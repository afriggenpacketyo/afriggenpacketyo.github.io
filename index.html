        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has tightened its control over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), requiring White House review of new reactor safety rules, a move criticized as potentially undermining the agency's independence. A draft executive order proposes staff reductions, regulation revisions, and possibly looser radiation exposure standards. Former NRC Chair Allison Macfarlane believes these changes could increase the risk of accidents due to political and industry influence, while others like Ted Nordhaus suggest reviewing radiation standards isn't necessarily a bad idea. The NRC stated it is cooperating with the White House to improve regulatory efficiency, while the White House defends the move as aligning with the President's constitutional powers.</p>

          <p>With rising interest rates and living costs, many people are looking to consolidate debts into a single monthly payment to ease financial stress. Debt consolidation combines multiple balances into one new loan with a single due date, interest rate, and payment. Options include personal consolidation loans, balance transfers, home equity loans, debt management plans, and debt consolidation programs. It's important to evaluate the total cost over the life of the loan and maintain discipline to avoid paying more interest over time; successful debt consolidation requires consistent effort and a solid plan.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC, drawing criticism from Democrats who question her qualifications.

          <p>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the main commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to close for several hours on Friday morning, disrupting the commute for over 170,000 passengers. The shutdown was caused by a computer networking problem that affected all 50 stations, preventing trains from operating. Though train service has resumed across the system, major delays are expected. The outage comes as BART struggles to attract passengers after the Covid-19 pandemic, with ridership remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <h2>Americans Still Long for Factory Jobs, Despite Changing Reality</h2>

          <p>Despite the decline in American manufacturing jobs since 1979, many Americans express a desire to bring them back, driven by cultural nostalgia and political appeal. While narratives about factory work align with conservative views, the issue cuts across political lines, with politicians on both sides calling for rebuilding American manufacturing. The reality of American manufacturing today includes a high number of available positions, but the jobs often require more skills and automation. Import tariffs, which have been proposed as a way to bring back manufacturing jobs, have not been shown to increase employment in protected sectors.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance, faces a new unrelated charge of insulting a member of prison staff. Brückner is currently serving a jail term for raping a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005, and is scheduled to walk free in September 2025. Prosecutors are working against the clock, fearing that Brückner, as a free man, will skip Germany and disappear. While no charges have ever been brought against Brückner in the McCann case, German investigators have classed the case as a murder inquiry.</p>

          <p>Members of the board overseeing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum clashed over email after a board member sent a letter condemning the institution’s silence on President Trump’s firings of Biden appointees. The letter invoked the Holocaust, sparking responses from fellow board members, including Representative Max Miller, who defended the President's authority to remove appointees. The United States Holocaust Memorial Council is led by presidential appointees who typically serve five-year terms, and the museum's silence on the firings has drawn criticism and debate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to receive the first group of White South African refugees, claiming they face racial discrimination, while banning most other refugees from entering the U.S. The initiative is a "stated priority" for the administration, and officials have planned a press event to welcome the group. In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to resettle Afrikaners, citing racially motivated seizures of land. The processing of Afrikaner refugees has been unusually fast, and the administration will use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid them.</p>

The government has proposed aggressive measures to fix Google’s illegal monopoly in internet search, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser and share proprietary data with competitors. Google, on the other hand, has argued that small tweaks to its business practices would be more appropriate. Judge Amit P. Mehta is expected to reach a decision by August.</p>

The UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was widely thought to be part of trade talks with the US. The government announced the DST remains "undisturbed and unchanged" as part of the US-UK deal slashing tariffs imposed by President Trump on cars and metals. The DST affects large multinational enterprises who run social media services, online search engines or an online marketplace for UK consumers.</p>

Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles. HHS Secretary Robert F.
