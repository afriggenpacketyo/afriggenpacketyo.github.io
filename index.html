        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Northern Lights were visible across the UK on Monday night due to a strong solar storm. The aurora's bright colors were spotted from northern Scotland to Norfolk and Kent after a coronal mass ejection was detected by satellites. The increased solar energy interacted with oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere, creating the vibrant colors. Space weather forecasters predict a potentially stronger geomagnetic storm, possibly bringing a greater chance to see the aurora across the UK, even with the naked eye, before activity returns to normal levels by Wednesday. The display offered a spectacle for many regions. </p>

The meeting occurred before China's military parade marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War Two. Both leaders criticized Western governments, with Xi denouncing "bullying" and Putin blaming the West for the Ukraine conflict, showing their shared stance against Western influence and solidifying their partnership on the global stage. </p>

          <p>Guyana held its presidential election amidst an oil boom and rising tensions with Venezuela. Voters chose from candidates representing six political parties, with the incumbent People's Progressive Party, the main opposition A Partnership for National Unity, and newcomer We Invest In Nationhood being the primary contenders. The winning party will manage significant oil revenues, though poverty remains a concern despite the country's newfound oil wealth. The election also occurred amidst a territorial dispute with Venezuela, with Guyana accusing Venezuela of firing shots on a boat transporting election officials, adding complexity to the political landscape. </p>

          <p>Newcastle United concluded a busy transfer window by selling Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a record £125m and acquiring Yoane Wissa from Brentford for £55m. The club reluctantly sold Isak after receiving an irresistible offer, while also securing Wissa to bolster their attacking options. The departure of Isak was met with mixed reactions from fans, while the arrival of Wissa and Nick Woltemade is expected to add depth to the squad. The club also hired a technical director to improve recruitment processes for future transfer windows, hoping to enhance their ability to compete with top clubs. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed performance as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in Tianjin and considered tariff uncertainties.

          <p>Scotland is projected to maintain its status as the European country with the highest rate of drug-related deaths for the seventh consecutive year. While experts anticipate a slight decrease in figures for 2024 compared to the 1,172 deaths in 2023, the arrival of deadly synthetic opioids like nitazenes is exacerbating the crisis. The crisis is rooted in social and economic changes, including deindustrialization and cuts to public spending, leading to high unemployment and addiction. Addressing this issue requires focusing on harm reduction and rehabilitation, but experts fear the situation may worsen due to the increased prevalence of synthetic opioids. </p>

          <p>A Chinese research team is developing a compact, detergent-free washing machine for astronauts that uses mist and ozone to clean clothes with minimal water. The cube-shaped device weighs 12kg and uses only 400ml of water per cycle to clean up to 800 grams of clothing. The machine uses ultraviolet light to produce ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes clothes, offering a solution for maintaining hygiene in space. This innovation could address the challenge of laundry in space missions. </p>

          <p>Health officials in New Jersey are sounding the alarm after detecting ticks carrying Lyme disease in all 21 counties across the state. Rising temperatures and shifting seasonal patterns are creating ideal conditions for ticks to breed and survive, expanding into suburban and urban environments. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States, causing symptoms ranging from fever and fatigue to severe joint pain and neurological problems. Residents are encouraged to use EPA-approved repellents, wear protective clothing, and check for ticks after spending time outdoors. </p>

          <p>Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are beginning to affect how Americans buy groceries. Under new policies, SNAP benefits are being reduced, impacting low-income Americans' purchasing power. While smaller, independent stores may struggle, larger grocers like Walmart are expected to benefit as consumers seek value. Experts predict a shift towards cheaper, less nutritious options as SNAP recipients trade down to stretch their dollars, potentially affecting public health. </p>

          <p>The UK government is changing the law to grant the Justice Secretary veto power over new sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. This change allows the Justice Secretary and the Lady Chief Justice to approve future guidelines before they are issued, ensuring greater democratic and judicial oversight. The move follows a dispute over pre-sentence reports for offenders from minority groups, with ministers intervening to block updated guidance. The reforms aim to ensure policy is set by parliamentarians while preserving the independence of judges in individual sentencing decisions. </p>
