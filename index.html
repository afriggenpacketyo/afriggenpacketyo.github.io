          <p>A double-decker bus traveling from Lima, Peru, veered off the road and fell into a ravine, killing at least 15 people and injuring around 30 others. The bus, carrying over 60 passengers, landed on its roof and was split in two by the impact. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, noting that such accidents are unfortunately common in the country, often attributed to reckless driving, excessive speed, and poor road conditions. The incident underscores ongoing road safety issues in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned Hong Kong for offering cash bounties for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in Britain. The Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression," as Hong Kong authorities offer up to $125,000 for 19 individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This action escalates tensions and raises serious safety concerns for the approximately 150,000 Hong Kong residents who have moved to the UK under a special visa scheme since 2021.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Deploy Sharks with Sensors to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are exploring an innovative method for hurricane forecasting by attaching sensors to sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. Led by the University of Delaware, the project aims to gather crucial data on ocean temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane formation and intensity. This approach could provide more efficient and continuous data collection than current methods like satellites or robotic gliders. The research turns these apex predators into living ocean sensors, potentially revolutionizing how scientists predict the behavior of powerful storms.</p>

          <p>A shooting incident inside a University of New Mexico dormitory resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and left a 19-year-old hospitalized with gunshot wounds. The event occurred when four individuals were playing video games in a dorm room, during which an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire. The suspect was taken into custody later the same day, and an investigation is ongoing. The university closed its central campus for the day as a precaution and is providing counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunisia's capital, Tunis, to denounce what they describe as the increasingly authoritarian regime of President Kais Saied. The demonstration marked four years since Saied's power grab, where he dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree. Protesters chanted for the "fall of the regime" and demanded the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists. Critics argue that the country has become an "open-air prison" as the government uses vague legal charges to suppress dissent and dismantle democratic institutions.</p>

The departures come amid a White House initiative to reduce the federal workforce and a proposed 25% budget cut for the agency in fiscal year 2026.

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of "proffer immunity" before her two-day, nine-hour interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. This legal protection allowed her to answer questions freely without her statements being used against her in a future prosecution, a common step when prosecutors are seeking cooperation. Maxwell, who is appealing her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, reportedly initiated the meetings. Her lawyer stated that she answered all questions, which covered roughly 100 different people, and that no promises were made in return.</p>

          <p>In response to a devastating disease that wiped out about 50% of the state's bighorn sheep, wildlife biologists in Texas are conducting a critical rescue and relocation mission. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region, threatening the native sheep population. Last fall, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent check confirmed the relocated herd is not only surviving but growing, offering hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have expressed bewilderment over Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's decision to personally interview convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. They described the meetings as highly unorthodox, breaking with longstanding Justice Department practices. Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge, not high-ranking officials, raising questions about the ability to assess Maxwell's credibility. The move is seen by some as a political effort to address public pressure regarding the Epstein case, rather than a standard procedural step.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores whether strict adherence to popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water or walking 10,000 steps a day, is truly necessary. While experts confirm the vital importance of getting seven to nine hours of sleep, there is more flexibility with other targets. A kidney specialist suggests drinking when thirsty is sufficient for most people, while a nutritionist notes hydration targets can help address symptoms like fatigue. The consensus is that while these benchmarks are useful guides, it is more important to incorporate a healthy outlook into daily life.</p>
