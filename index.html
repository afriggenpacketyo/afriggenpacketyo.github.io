          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is aiming to expand its presence in South Texas with the Starbase project, potentially incorporating the launch site into its own city. This proposal has generated mixed reactions from the local community, as some residents fear limited access to Boca Chica Beach and environmental disruption due to increased rocket launches. SpaceX seeks to increase its launch frequency to 25 times a year, raising concerns about pollution, home shaking, and rising rent. While SpaceX claims to be working with the community, residents express concerns about the long-term impact on their way of life and the natural environment.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, is significantly delayed and over budget, raising questions about America's ability to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. The project, initially intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, now aims to connect Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. Eminent-domain lawyer Mark Wasser, representing landowners affected by the rail line, disputes claims that land acquisition is the primary cause of delays. Farmers and landowners have faced disruptions to their operations due to the rail line's diagonal path across agricultural land, leading to complex negotiations and settlements.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters of the bill, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for students and parents, while Democrats argue that it will harm public schools by siphoning funds. Critics also suggest that the program will primarily benefit wealthier families already enrolled in private schools.</p>

Kerger said the administration is attacking PBS through multiple avenues, including possible rescission of already appropriated funds and challenges to corporate sponsorships. Federal funding constitutes 15% of PBS's budget, but is existential for stations in smaller communities that rely on it for 40-50% of their funding.

          <p>Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez's recent fight against William Scull was criticized for its lack of action, leading to questions about his upcoming bout with Terence Crawford. Experts and fans expressed disappointment with the poor spectacle in Riad, raising concerns about the value of multi-million dollar investments in boxing. Crawford, a highly skilled boxer, will move up two weight divisions to challenge Canelo, raising doubts about the competitiveness of the fight. While Crawford brings talent and aggression, the significant weight difference may lead to another unequal contest, similar to Amir Khan's fight against Canelo.</p>
