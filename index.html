          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals a prevailing negative sentiment towards the U.S. economy and job market, a trend that has persisted for years. Rising prices are identified as the main factor influencing public perception, with most Americans expecting continued increases. Over half of respondents view the job market negatively and believe finding desirable employment would be challenging. The survey also highlights significant public suspicion regarding the impact of AI, with a majority anticipating a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields and the broader U.S. economy over the next decade. This widespread skepticism spans various demographics, though it is slightly less pronounced among younger Americans.</p>

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth saw a significant jump of 6% in extended trading after CEO Barbara Humpton disclosed ongoing "close communication" with the Trump administration. This announcement aligns with the administration's strategy to bolster domestic rare earth supply chains, as evidenced by recent equity investments in Lithium Americas and MP Materials. Humpton supports these governmental moves, emphasizing that building this marketplace will require many players, not a zero-sum game. USA Rare Earth is advancing its own projects, including a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, and a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to help break U.S. dependence on China.

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, Endeavor Air Flights 5047 and 5155, experienced a low-speed collision on a LaGuardia Airport taxiway in New York. The incident occurred when the arriving Flight 5047 struck the wing of the departing Flight 5155, with preliminary information suggesting a possible miscommunication in air traffic control instructions. One flight attendant suffered a minor injury and received medical attention, but airport operations remained unaffected. The National Transportation Safety Board is actively investigating the event, having recovered flight recorders from both aircraft for detailed analysis. Passengers were safely deplaned and offered new travel arrangements.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon is characterized by chaos, focusing on public image rather than substantive policy, according to a recent analysis. His tenure has been marked by significant personnel issues, high-profile resignations, and leak investigations, fostering an atmosphere of paranoia within the department. Critics argue Hegseth, chosen by President Trump for his outward persona, lacks the deep experience of his predecessors, leading to a department primarily focused on implementing executive orders. His ideological flexibility and unwavering loyalty to Trump are seen as crucial factors in his continued, yet controversial, role.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has submitted a letter to the court, taking "full responsibility and accountability" for his past actions, including a 2016 sexual assault against Cassie Ventura. Ahead of his sentencing for two prostitution-related convictions, Combs expressed deep remorse for the hurt caused and claimed to be sober for the first time in 25 years, attributing his transformation to God. While his legal team requested a 14-month penalty, prosecutors are seeking a minimum of 11 years behind bars. Combs hopes to be an example of second chances, despite the judge rejecting his earlier requests for a new trial.</p>

The survivor, Cindy Clemishire, hopes her story empowers other victims to come forward, while Morris's attorneys conveyed his remorse and desire for closure.

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study indicates a concerning trend of more Americans living paycheck to paycheck, severely impeding their ability to save for retirement. The report found that roughly 42% of younger working Americans, across Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X, have no disposable income after covering basic living costs, a figure projected to exceed half by 2033 due to rising housing and healthcare expenses. This financial strain highlights a "financial vortex" that makes traditional retirement advice like "save more" unrealistic for many.

The updated cards showcase California’s diverse natural landscapes, such as redwoods, poppies, and the coastline, replacing previous generic imagery. A notable change is the removal of the magnetic stripe, with new anti-counterfeit measures integrated using next-generation technology. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, and the familiar REAL ID symbol is retained. These periodic updates are part of an ongoing effort to improve security, with the last major redesign having occurred in 2010.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signaled intentions to use the ongoing federal government shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to implement permanent cuts to "Democrat Agencies," sparking strong opposition from Democrats. Budget Director Russ Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, has already announced cancellations of $8 billion in energy projects and $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City. Legal experts, however, argue that the administration lacks the authority for permanent layoffs during a temporary lapse in appropriations, viewing these threats as a political bluff to force negotiations.

          <p>Conservation groups are advising visitors to stay away from U.S. national parks during the government shutdown, citing risks to both public safety and park resources due to skeleton staffing. The National Parks Conservation Association warns that visitors will be "probably on your own" with limited facilities. The Trump administration's decision to keep parks partially open, despite furloughing over half the workforce, draws criticism from former rangers who recall vandalism and looting during the 2018 shutdown. Concerns are heightened by earlier layoffs, meaning fewer staff are available to address potential damage once the shutdown ends.</p>

          <p>This essay delves into Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology that emerged as an act of resistance and remembrance among enslaved Africans in Cuba. Practitioners like Francisco Álvarez León find grounding and connection through its deities, orishas, and emphasis on character and balance. The article highlights efforts by contemporary scholars to destigmatize the religion, which is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black biases. It stresses Lucumí's core principles of protection, healing, and community, challenging sensationalized views on practices like animal sacrifice.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, has resigned following a dispute with the Trump administration over a proposed gift to King Charles.

Arrington stated he was given an ultimatum to "resign or be fired" and denied making any negative remarks about the administration.

          <p>Elon Musk has urged his X followers to cancel Netflix subscriptions, citing a "transgender woke agenda" controversy stemming from the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park." This call to action also referenced alleged statements by the show's creator mocking a conservative activist. While the show was canceled in 2023, Musk's posts have reignited conservative backlash. Analysts, however, believe the boycott is unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's subscriber numbers or stock value, noting the company's large market cap and potential offsets from increased ad revenue, despite a slight dip in shares.</p>

The inquiry found clinical errors, operations beyond her skill, and a failure to seek help.
