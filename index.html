          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% in August, matching economists' forecasts, indicating a slight increase in inflation. The CPI tracks the change in prices on everyday items, and inflation has remained at or below 3% this year. Some economists attribute the rise to the Trump administration's tariffs, as businesses pass on import duties to consumers. The Federal Reserve is considering potential rate cuts amid signs of strain in the labor market, while balancing the need to keep inflation in check. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NPR has appointed Thomas Evans, a CNN veteran, as its new news chief, succeeding Edith Chapin on September 15, as the network faces financial challenges due to the end of federal funding. Evans aims to maintain NPR's journalistic mission and innovate in how it shares its journalism, emphasizing the network's strengths in subject knowledge, international coverage, and storytelling. The appointment comes after public and political outcry over an essay critical of NPR's news coverage, and amid broader concerns about the future of public media funding. NPR is navigating potential budget cuts and strategic shifts in response to these challenges. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the recent military parade in Beijing and the absence of many European leaders, arguing it was a missed opportunity for the EU to engage with China and confront Putin on Ukraine. The author suggests that instead of criticizing China's support for Russia, EU leaders could have presented a unified engagement plan for Ukraine. The lack of European engagement ceded the diplomatic stage to China, reinforcing divisions the EU opposes. The article suggests this reflects a pattern of failed diplomacy where Europe's role is reduced to criticism rather than problem-solving. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the impact of AI chatbots on higher education, arguing that they are incompatible with the liberal arts tradition due to AI-enabled cheating and the subversion of institutional goals. The author proposes that colleges should focus on limiting and abolishing unauthorized AI use on campus. The author suggests measures such as de-teching classrooms, banning smartphones and laptops, and requiring students to live on campus. The author argues that such measures are necessary to prioritize learning, creativity, and sustained intellectual engagement. </p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that husbands can take their wives' surnames, overturning a law that was deemed gender-based discrimination. The ruling came after two couples challenged the law that prevented men from taking their wives' surnames. Parliament will now have to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's decision. The couples argued that the law was archaic and violated equality rights enshrined in the South African constitution. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study links over 200 recent heat waves to human-caused climate change and the greenhouse gas pollution of major fossil fuel producers. The study found that many heat waves were substantially more likely and intense due to the activity of major fossil fuel producers. Some individual fossil fuel companies had emissions high enough to cause some of the more extreme heat waves. The study adds to a growing body of research linking the emissions of fossil fuel companies to extreme weather events and could become more important in climate-related litigation. </p>

          <p>China's top economic planner has announced a megaproject to expand shipping capacity on the Three Gorges, slated to span the coming five-year plan, while also calling for greater investment to drive strategic initiatives. The project would ease traffic at the Three Gorges-Gezhouba hub by building a new double-line, five-stage lock system and increasing Gezhouba's shipping capacity. The project is described as the biggest integrated project on the Yangtze River since the Three Gorges Dam, combining water management, navigation, and ecological functions. The total investment is estimated at about 76.6 billion yuan. </p>
