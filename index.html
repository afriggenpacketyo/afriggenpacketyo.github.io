        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union chief diplomat Kaja Kallas strongly condemned recent deadly Russian airstrikes on Kyiv, urging increased pressure and new sanctions on Moscow, specifically targeting energy exports and financial services. EU defense and foreign affairs ministers are convening in Copenhagen to discuss these punitive measures and explore long-term security guarantees for Ukraine once the fighting subsides. The discussions are set against the backdrop of a massive Russian air attack that resulted in over 20 deaths in Kyiv and damaged the EU delegation office, underscoring Russia's continued disregard for international peace efforts and the urgent need for a unified response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major British banks, including NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays, experienced notable stock declines on Friday. This downturn followed reports indicating that the UK finance minister, Rachel Reeves, might target the banking sector with measures such as a profit surcharge, as she seeks to bolster public finances. These potential actions have generated significant concern among banking executives, contributing to a broader dip in the pan-European Stoxx 600 index. While the wider European market was also influenced by regional inflation prints and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate expectations, the Stoxx 600 is still projected to achieve its first back-to-back positive month this year, suggesting underlying resilience despite current jitters.</p>

          <p>Jose Mourinho has officially departed from his role as Fenerbahce manager after just over a year, with his exit coming two days after the Turkish club was eliminated from the Champions League play-offs by Benfica. During his sole season in charge, Mourinho guided Fenerbahce to a second-place finish in the league. However, his tenure was notably marked by considerable controversy, including accusations of making "racist statements" from rival club Galatasaray, which he vehemently denied and countered with a lawsuit. Mourinho was also a frequent and vocal critic of officiating standards in Turkey, which ultimately led to him receiving a four-match ban, later reduced to two, for his comments about referees.</p>

          <p>A visibly frustrated Stefanos Tsitsipas confronted his opponent, Daniel Altmaier, over the latter's use of underarm serves after Tsitsipas blew a match point and exited the US Open in the second round. Following a five-set loss, Tsitsipas implied he had targeted Altmaier's body during their handshake, drawing boos from the crowd. This defeat marks a significant low point, as the former world No. 3 will end the season without reaching a Grand Slam third round for the first time since 2017. Tsitsipas, who recently reunited with his father as coach, has struggled with his form, failing to win back-to-back matches since April.</p>

          <p>ANZ, one of Australia's largest banks, has issued an apology to staff who discovered they had been fired through an automated email instructing them to return their laptops. Bruce Rush, ANZ's retail banking executive, acknowledged the error, stating it was "not our intention to share such sensitive news with you in this way" amidst ongoing job cuts. The Financial Sector Union strongly condemned the incident, describing the "botched" episode as "disgusting" and a consequence of the company's "chaotic pace of change." The union emphasized that dignity and respect for workers should not be sacrificed for speed and cost-cutting.</p>

          <p>Denmark has significantly reduced its 2025 growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, largely attributing the downgrade to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited increased competition in the weight loss drug market and the impact of US tariffs on European pharma as key factors. Despite the revision, the ministry maintains that Denmark's economy remains strong overall, with high employment and inflation projected below 2%. The 2026 growth forecast was revised higher, anticipating increased private and public consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

While a Home Office minister deemed some roles unnecessary, an asylum seekers' rights charity argued the government has a duty to support the mental health and well-being of detainees.

          <h2>European Leaders Condemn Deadly Russian Strikes on Kyiv, EU Office Damaged</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European leaders, including EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, expressed outrage following Russia's deadliest airstrikes on Kyiv since July, which killed 23 people and severely damaged the EU delegation office. Ukrainian officials reported nearly 600 drones and over 30 ballistic and cruise missiles were fired, primarily hitting a five-storey residential building. The attacks are seen as a deliberate escalation, with leaders reiterating calls for new, tough sanctions on Russia and condemning its disregard for peace efforts, emphasizing that Moscow chose "ballistics instead of the negotiating table."</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully unveiled and tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone that strikingly resembles the enigmatic "Gimbal" unidentified flying object spotted by US Navy pilots in 2015. This experimental aircraft features a unique elliptical, ring-like wing design that integrates a straight central wing section, forming a closed-loop structure. Four rotors are mounted at junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers, serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements. This radical change in aerodynamic design aims to enhance endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight, prompting renewed interest in advanced aerospace capabilities.</p>

Cambricon also highlighted its vulnerability to US export restrictions, which have placed it on the Entity List and could adversely affect its supply chain stability and operating performance. The recent rally was fueled by China's favorable policy support for local AI chips and a new AI model from DeepSeek. (not investment advice)</p>

While Townsend did not perceive a racial undertone, she acknowledged the historical stigma against the Black community regarding education, noting it's "the furthest thing from the truth." Ostapenko later denied any racist intent on Instagram, but Osaka emphasized the deep-seated implications of such remarks within a predominantly white sport.</p>

Both nations face US tariff pressures, which could push them towards reluctant cooperation, transforming their adversarial relationship. While experts doubt the summit will lead to a long-lasting friendship, it offers a chance for dialogue on trade imbalances, with India aiming to curb its widening deficit with China. India also seeks to position itself as a manufacturing hub, but its reliance on Chinese raw materials complicates diversification efforts.</p>
