          <p>England winger Jack Grealish has officially joined Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, citing decisive talks with manager David Moyes as a key factor in his decision. The 29-year-old expressed immense excitement to join what he calls a "great club with great fans," acknowledging the overwhelming support received from Everton supporters. This move offers Grealish a crucial opportunity to revitalize his career after making only seven league starts last season and being excluded from City's Club World Cup squad. Both Grealish and Moyes hope this transfer will help him reclaim his place in the England national team.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 11:57:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July increased by 2.7% on an annual basis, a figure slightly lower than economists' predictions, while core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose to 3.1%. Food prices continued to climb, causing stress for many Americans, though gasoline costs saw a slight decline. Experts suggest that despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, the latest data, coupled with a slowdown in July's hiring, keeps the possibility of a September rate cut on the table. The Federal Reserve's next decision will be informed by upcoming economic reports, as it balances employment and price stability mandates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation in July remained steady at 2.7% annually, with declines in grocery and gasoline prices offsetting increases in other sectors. However, economists highlight worrying signs, particularly the growing influence of Trump administration policies like tariffs and immigration restrictions on consumer prices. Experts predict these effects will become more pronounced later in the year, with some anticipating core CPI to peak at 3.8% by year-end due to tariffs bleeding through. While White House officials deny a tariff link, the data shows core goods inflation at a two-year high, suggesting an impact on household furnishings and apparel.</p>

          <p>Brandon Blackstock, Kelly Clarkson's ex-husband, passed away at 48 from melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, after a three-year private battle. His death brings renewed attention to melanoma, which is the most lethal type of skin cancer, projected to cause over 8,400 deaths in the U.S. this year. Medical experts emphasize that early detection is crucial for curability, with advanced cases now showing improved survival rates due to modern immunotherapy and cell therapy. Prevention methods, including sun protection and avoiding tanning beds, are vital, alongside regular skin checks for high-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant victory in his civil lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell, as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled he is not required to participate in arbitration overseen by Goodell. The court determined that Gruden's resignation made him exempt from the NFL Constitution's arbitration mandate, stating that forcing him into arbitration would be "unconscionable." This decision appears to pave the way for Gruden's lawsuit, which alleges a "malicious and orchestrated campaign" to destroy his career through leaked emails, to proceed in state court. Gruden's attorney expressed satisfaction, stating the victory validates his client's reputation and clears the path to justice.</p>

The Fed has maintained steady rates throughout 2025 despite Trump's calls, with Powell previously stating that tariff policies impacted rate cut decisions.

Both account types offer variable interest rates higher than standard savings accounts, with comparable annual percentage yields (APYs) often ranging between 3.4% and 3.5%. The primary distinction lies in accessibility, as money market accounts typically provide a debit card and check-writing capabilities, unlike most high-yield savings accounts. Experts suggest money market accounts for larger nest eggs requiring occasional access, while high-yield savings are better suited for emergency funds or short-term goals, emphasizing the importance of comparing APYs and minimums.

For those seeking continued long-term growth, reinvesting RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, particularly using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for tax efficiency, is a viable strategy. Charitable individuals can consider Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs), directly transferring up to $108,000 from an IRA to an eligible non-profit, which can satisfy RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, RMDs can be used for legacy planning by contributing to a 529 college savings plan for family members, potentially offering state tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has issued a stark warning that it may not be able to continue as a going concern without securing additional cash, just five months after emerging from bankruptcy. Despite efforts to cut debt and attract bookings with more upscale products, the airline continues to face challenging market conditions, including elevated domestic capacity and weak leisure travel demand. The company's financial results are not improving at the pace required by creditor agreements, leading to a potential risk of default. Spirit is now exploring options such as selling aircraft, real estate, or airport gates to raise necessary funds.</p>

          <p>A new U.K. Online Safety Act, mandating age verification on adult sites and other platforms, has triggered significant backlash from internet users and U.S. politicians. The provisions, aimed at preventing children from accessing harmful content, require users to provide personal information like IDs or credit card details, even for platforms not traditionally considered pornographic. This has led to a surge in VPN usage in the UK and a legal ruling subjecting Wikipedia to stricter user verification. U.S. officials express concerns that the law infringes on free expression and could restrict American tech companies, despite UK officials deeming the issue non-negotiable.</p>

          <p>Proposed federal government cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces are projected to cause 10 million Americans to lose health insurance by 2034, leading to significant hidden costs across society. While intended to address budget deficits, these cuts will shift financial burdens onto federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and nonprofit hospitals, which serve as crucial safety nets for the uninsured. An increase in uninsured individuals is expected to raise uncompensated care costs for hospitals and exacerbate medical debt for patients, potentially leading to bankruptcies. Furthermore, a less healthy populace due to reduced access to care could negatively impact overall economic productivity.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Monica Seles has publicly shared her diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG), a rare neuromuscular autoimmune disease she received three years ago, aiming to raise awareness. MG affects voluntary muscles, causing weakness and fatigue, and can lead to symptoms like double vision, droopy eyelids, and difficulty speaking or swallowing. The autoimmune form occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks itself, though the exact cause remains unclear. While there is no cure for MG, treatments like medication and surgery can help manage symptoms, and some cases may even go into remission, offering hope for those affected.</p>

The article highlights that IonQ's current price-to-sales ratio is extremely high, suggesting an overvaluation fueled by market euphoria for tech stocks. It concludes that investing in IonQ currently appears to be a speculative bet on an unproven market, advising caution for potential investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent emphasis on protecting eagles from wind energy projects, as stated by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, is viewed by critics as a pretext for stalling U.S. wind farm development. While wind turbines do pose a threat to birds, including eagles, environmental experts point out that much larger threats exist, such as stray cats, buildings, and climate change. Ironically, the very policies the Trump administration is now eroding, like those safeguarding migratory birds, were instrumental in the bald eagle's recovery from near extinction. Critics argue that the administration's actions contradict genuine environmental protection, favoring the oil and gas industry instead.</p>
