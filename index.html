        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert proposes a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" that focuses on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions, responding without shame, viewing misbehavior as a stress signal, and taking responsibility after conflicts. Emotionally safe parents create an environment where children feel safe expressing big emotions and showing up as their authentic selves. This parenting style encourages parents to reflect on their own childhood triggers, see behavior as communication, and set boundaries with empathy rather than control, fostering resilience and connection in their children.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, communities commemorated the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, which sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Floyd's family gathered in Houston, his hometown, while Minneapolis held various memorial events. However, some observers note that the national "reckoning" with racism that followed Floyd's murder seems to be fading, particularly as some reforms are being rolled back. The events served as a reminder of the ongoing need to address systemic racism and police misconduct, despite the shifts in national attention and policy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the United States' "silence" regarding recent Russian attacks encourages President Vladimir Putin, following Moscow's largest aerial assault since the war began. The overnight attack involved a high number of drones and missiles, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and numerous injuries across Ukraine. Zelensky emphasized that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without significant pressure on the Russian leadership, likely referring to further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow for its continued invasion.</p>

          <p>Top Republicans in the U.S. Senate are threatening to block President Trumpâ€™s spending bill if it does not address the growing national debt. Senator Ron Johnson stated that his faction has enough votes to halt the bill until Trump commits to spending reductions and deficit reduction. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts in exchange for about $1 trillion in benefits cuts, but budget hawks are concerned that it will add trillions to the federal deficit. The bill's future in the Senate is uncertain due to tight Republican majorities and concerns over the impact on healthcare coverage.</p>

Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for a more dignified approach, leading to the current practice of in-person notifications with additional support. Her work has had a lasting impact, providing comfort and recognition to grieving families. In 2023, the Pentagon renamed Ft. Benning to Ft. Moore, honoring both Julie and her husband, marking the first time an American military base was named for a civilian.</p>

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has joined a growing chorus of European politicians calling for urgent talks with the United States following President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe.

The EU's trade chief also responded, stating the bloc is committed to securing a mutually beneficial deal and that trade relations should be guided by respect, not threats, amid fears of global economic disruption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming towards the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. Despite Israel's previous attacks on Syria to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands, Trump's meeting with President Ahmed al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions have led to a near cessation of Israeli strikes. This shift in American foreign policy has potentially undercut Israeli efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor, raising concerns among Israeli officials about the true intentions of the new Syrian government.</p>
