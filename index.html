          <p>Liverpool has completed the signing of Swedish striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record transfer fee of £125 million, which could rise to £130 million with add-ons.

The deal was finalized on the last day of the transfer window, marking a major acquisition for Liverpool as they bolster their attacking options. Isak will wear the number nine shirt at Anfield.</p>

          <p>Carolina Panthers' starting left tackle, Ikem Ekwonu, is questionable for the team's first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars following an emergency appendectomy. The 24-year-old, a former No. 6 overall draft pick, reported stomach pain last week, leading to the necessary surgery. Coach Dave Canales has listed Ekwonu as "day-to-day," creating uncertainty for the team's offensive line. If Ekwonu is unable to play, veteran backup Yosh Nijman is expected to take his place in the lineup.</p>

The announcement comes shortly after Giuliani was hospitalized with serious injuries from a car crash. Trump praised Giuliani as the "greatest Mayor" in New York's history and a great patriot. The decision highlights Giuliani's complex legacy, from his leadership after the 9/11 attacks to his more recent legal troubles and disbarment for spreading false election claims.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's planned acquisition of Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi for £35 million has unexpectedly fallen through on the final day of the transfer window. Although a deal was agreed upon and Guehi had begun his medical, Crystal Palace reversed their decision after failing to secure a suitable replacement. The collapse means the 25-year-old England international will remain at Palace, where he is in the final year of his contract. The situation leaves Liverpool's defensive reinforcement plans in question while creating a complex future for both Guehi and his club.</p>

          <p>Nine former leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are "endangering every American's health." In a guest essay, they criticized his focus on unproven treatments, downplaying of vaccines, and replacement of scientific experts with unqualified individuals. This public rebuke follows the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, which reportedly stemmed from disagreements over Kennedy's directives on vaccine policy. The former officials describe the situation as unprecedented and alarming for the nation's public health system.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of threatening his country's sovereignty, claiming the recent deployment of US warships in the Caribbean is part of a plan for "regime change." Maduro stated that Venezuela is facing its "biggest threat in 100 years" and would declare a "republic in arms" if attacked. While the US maintains the deployment is for anti-drug trafficking operations, tensions have escalated, with Venezuela's neighbor Guyana welcoming the American military presence amid its own territorial dispute with Caracas.

          <p>According to a Pew Research Center analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has fallen by 1.2 million since January. This decline coincides with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of migrants and increased enforcement. Immigrants constitute a significant portion of the labor force in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and services. Economists suggest this reduction could create labor shortages, impact job growth, and affect states that are highly dependent on foreign workers, potentially complicating the overall picture of the U.S. labor market.

          <p>Following a congressional decision to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding, public broadcasting stations across the U.S. are grappling with severe budget shortfalls. Stations like KSPS in Spokane are launching emergency fund drives, but many, especially those in rural areas, face an uncertain future. While the national NPR and PBS networks are reducing dues to help, job losses and programming cuts have already begun. The funding elimination, long sought by some Republicans, has forced the public media system into a fight for survival, relying on community support and philanthropic efforts to bridge the financial gap.

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas after the jet ski he was riding collided with another vessel in the waters off Paradise Island. Police found the man unresponsive with visible injuries and he was pronounced dead at the scene. The incident has prompted an investigation and draws attention to broader safety concerns in the area. The U.S. Embassy had previously issued a security alert in April, warning citizens about the risks of renting jet skis in Nassau, citing reports of sexual assaults by operators and prohibiting U.S. government employees from using them.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius called the public discussion of such plans "completely wrong" before any negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have occurred, emphasizing that the EU lacks the jurisdiction for such deployments. His remarks reveal a division among European leaders on the strategy for Ukraine's long-term security. The article also notes that leaders from Britain and France are set to co-chair a summit on security guarantees this week.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has cautioned the US team not to expect the same tactics used in their 2023 victory, despite naming a nearly identical roster for the upcoming event at Bethpage. Donald confirmed that 11 of the 12 players from the winning Rome team will return, with Rasmus Højgaard being the only new face. However, he emphasized that playing away from home presents a "different challenge" requiring a new strategy and that pairings will not simply be a "rinse and repeat." Donald also urged his players to embrace the famously raucous New York crowd.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to criticize a new policy in Alberta that requires school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content." The move comes after her iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was banned in some schools under the new rule. Atwood's new story ironically describes two "very, very good children" who grow up and have a family without ever having sex, mocking the sanitized view of the world the ban seems to promote. This act of protest highlights the growing debate over book bans and censorship in Canada.</p>
