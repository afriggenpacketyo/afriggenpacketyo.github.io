          <p>OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit will retain control of the company as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, responding to pressure from civic leaders and former employees. This decision, backed by Microsoft and valued at $300 billion, came after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. The move aims to ensure the nonprofit's mission remains central while allowing for employee and investor equity. OpenAI is currently in a legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes the shift towards a for-profit model, but CEO Sam Altman asserts the company remains focused on its core mission, with the nonprofit retaining control of the majority of shares.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala theme, 'Tailored for You,' will celebrate Black style and the history of dandyism, aligning with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's spring exhibition, 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.' Co-chairs include Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour, with LeBron James as an honorary chair. The exhibition, inspired by Monica L. Miller's book, explores the evolution of Black identity through fashion, from enslavement to global trendsetting. This marks the first time the Met has centered Black identity and Black designers, combating the erasure of Black history, and the event has already raised a record $31 million for the museum's Costume Institute.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the fall of Saigon, adoptees from "Operation Babylift" share their experiences of being airlifted to America for adoption. The U.S. government transported nearly 2,600 Vietnamese children to the U.S. in 1975, but the mission was controversial, as some children had families and were not orphans. A lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government to determine eligibility for adoption, but it was denied and the records were sealed. Many adoptees have turned to DNA tests to uncover their past, while some have no desire to find biological relatives.</p>

China is a major importer of U.S. soybeans, and the new tariffs bring the effective tariff for the crop to 155 percent.

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is experiencing a surge in sponsorships and stadium attendance due to the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S. Sponsorship revenue is up double digits compared to 2024, with brands like Michelob Ultra and Adidas investing in the league. The arrival of Lionel Messi has boosted ticket and merchandise sales, and the upcoming 2026 World Cup is further fueling sponsorship growth. MLS has also attracted a younger, more diverse fanbase, making it an attractive demographic for advertisers and marketers, with over 12 million fans attending games in 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, the national average for gasoline is over $3 per gallon, according to AAA and GasBuddy. Trump's claim appears to be based on RBOB gasoline futures, which track wholesale gasoline prices before taxes and other costs are added. Analysts state this price is irrelevant to consumers, as it does not reflect the actual cost at the pump, and the average pump price may fall below $3 a gallon.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent encouraged global business leaders to invest in the United States, despite concerns about President Trump's trade policies. Bessent argued that tax cuts and deregulation will spur job creation and output, outweighing the negative effects of tariffs. Business leaders, however, expressed concerns about the trade war and its impact on economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected a slowdown in global output, and investors have grown wary of Trump's policies, with stocks, bonds, and the dollar showing signs of weakness.</p>

          <p>New York City has ended its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which began in 1997 to protect the city's drinking water supply by purchasing land in the watershed. The city spent $518 million to assemble a vast area to prevent waste from entering the water, allowing it to avoid filtration. The program has been controversial, with local residents uneasy about the city's land purchases and restrictions on development. The city will now focus on a smaller Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program with local approval required for any land transactions.</p>
