            <p>The Florida Gators secured their third NCAA men's basketball championship by defeating the Houston Cougars 65-63 after staging a significant comeback. Overcoming a double-digit deficit and a scoreless first half from star player Walter Clayton Jr., Florida rallied in the second half, with Clayton ultimately making a crucial defensive play in the final seconds. Will Richard's early offensive contributions and strong team defense in the final minute were also key to Florida's victory. This win marks Florida's first national title since 2007 and makes Todd Golden the youngest coach to win the championship since 1983.</p>

            <p>The stock market fluctuated wildly on Monday as President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs on China, sparking recession concerns among economists. Leading indexes initially dropped sharply before briefly rebounding on a false report of a tariff freeze, only to decline again. Goldman Sachs economists increased the odds of a recession to 45% due to the tariffs' potential impact on economic growth and inflation. Overseas markets also experienced steep losses, reflecting global anxiety over the escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

The Financial Times reports on Trump's new tariff threat as fears of an escalating trade war and potential recession grow.

The Daily Star mockingly portrays Trump as a lettuce, referencing a previous incident involving Liz Truss' mini-budget.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has stated its firm opposition to President Trump's threat of escalating tariffs on Chinese goods, promising to take countermeasures to protect its interests. This response follows Trump's announcement of a potential 50% tariff increase if China does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs on American products. China views the U.S. actions as economic bullying and insists it will defend its rights. The expanded tariffs have already increased the U.S. weighted average tariff rate on China, potentially impacting China's economic growth.</p>

This shift has prompted increased defense spending in Europe and Asia, benefiting companies like Germany's Rheinmetall and South Korea's Hanwha Aerospace, as these countries seek to bolster their own military capabilities and secure weapons from reliable allies.

Zhou argues that while the Taiwan issue is a potential flashpoint, China's military build-up, especially its navy, is also driven by the need to safeguard overseas interests and shoulder international responsibilities. He notes that China is focused on building a hi-tech "global navy," while the US, under President Trump, pressures its allies.

            <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concern that President Trump's sweeping tariffs will lead to a recession, with 69% expecting a downturn, many as soon as this year. The survey indicates that CEOs anticipate price increases, potential job cuts, and resurgent inflation due to the tariffs. Concerns also extend to potential boycotts of American brands overseas as a result of the U.S. trade policy. While some hope for a reshoring boom, many CEOs believe any such gains will take years to materialize, and few plan to build new domestic manufacturing facilities in response to the tariffs.

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can continue using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport alleged gang members, but with certain limitations. While the court sided with the administration, it emphasized that judicial review is required, ensuring that deportees have a chance to challenge their removal. The ruling mandates that notice be given to those facing deportation, allowing them to seek habeas relief in the proper venue before being removed.

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting Saturday. The meeting will be at "almost the highest level," and Trump hopes that a deal can be made. Netanyahu, who has frequently called the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran an existential threat to Israel, said he and Trump are united in the goal that Tehran will never get nuclear weapons. Trump also reiterated his vision of a post-war exodus of Palestinians from Gaza, which Arab nations have rejected.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, with the condition that certain limits are applied. Any challenges to the wartime law, called the Alien Enemies Act, must take place in Texas, where the migrants were held, and not in Washington DC, the court said. The court’s majority placed limits on how deportations may occur, emphasizing that judicial review is required. Trump celebrated the ruling, while conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett and the court’s three liberal justices dissented.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to assemble a task force to change the CDC's guidance on recommending fluoride in public water, while the EPA is reviewing "new science" on fluoride. Utah recently became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water. A National Toxicology Program report found lower IQ in children with higher fluoride exposure, prompting a federal judge to order the EPA to assess the potential risk of fluoride. The American Dental Association maintains that fluoride at U.S.-recommended levels is safe and necessary for good oral health.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take “countermeasures” against any move by the United States to further raise tariffs and pledged to take firm action to stabilize the markets, after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap another 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports. China’s Ministry of Commerce said that China “firmly opposes” any moves to increase tariffs by the US and vowed to “resolutely respond” if it does so. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market”.</p>

The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations issued an unusually tough statement, accusing China of “illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions” endangering maritime security.</p>

The trial is expected to last until mid-May and will examine Vallow Daybell's relationship with Charles Vallow and the circumstances surrounding his death, including her apocalyptic religious beliefs.</p>

Zelensky thanked several army units defending Ukraine, including the 225th Assault Regiment deployed in the Belgorod region.

The effort — which had overwhelming support among lawmakers — responds to a troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country. The “turquoise alert” system — taking its name from the blue-green mineral — will allow law enforcement to quickly share information. It will function much like “amber” and “silver” alerts that highlight the disappearance of children and the elderly.</p>
