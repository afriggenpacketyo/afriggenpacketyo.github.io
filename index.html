          <p>Minneapolis is grappling with increased violence, exemplified by recent shootings that resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries, which Jim Schultz, a former attorney general nominee, attributes to years of anti-police rhetoric and failed leadership. He argues that reduced police staffing and lenient prosecution policies have emboldened criminals. Schultz criticizes Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty for policies that undermine public safety, such as considering race in sentencing guidelines. The Justice Department has initiated an investigation into whether the Hennepin County Attorneyâ€™s Office is engaging in illegal consideration of race in its prosecutorial decision-making.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in the UK Parliament that would allow for an additional two years of imprisonment for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from avoiding justice and provide a sense of closure for victims' families. The bill could apply to cases in the Crown Court, including those who are disruptive and removed from court. While some believe an extra two years may not be a significant deterrent, restricting family visits and parole eligibility are other options being considered.</p>
