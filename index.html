          <p>Financial experts assert that the 10-year Treasury yield has a more direct and significant impact on mortgage interest rates than the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. While the Fed's decisions influence short-term borrowing costs and overall economic sentiment, mortgage rates more closely follow the long-term Treasury yield, typically running about 1.5% to 2.0% higher. This is because the duration of Treasury bonds better aligns with the average life of a mortgage loan. Lenders and investors use the 10-year yield as a primary guide for pricing mortgage products.

          <p>The UAB Blazers have fired head football coach and former Super Bowl champion Trent Dilfer following a 2-4 start to the season. The decision came after a 53-33 blowout loss to Florida Atlantic, marking another season without a winning record under his leadership. UAB's athletics director, Mark Ingram, stated that the team's on-field performance did not meet the program's standards for winning. Alex Mortensen has been appointed as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season while the university begins its search for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>Following the impeachment of President Dina Boluarte, concerns are rising about the future of the Chinese-invested Chancay Port in Peru, a major Belt and Road Initiative project. The $3.5 billion deep-water facility, operated by China's Cosco Shipping, is a flagship of Chinese investment in Latin America. The recent political instability in Peru, which led to José Jerí becoming interim president, could create an opening for the United States to exert pressure on the region. Observers remain cautiously optimistic that the project can avoid significant disruption despite the political upheaval in the country.</p>

          <p>U.S. retailers are adopting a cautious approach to seasonal hiring for the upcoming holiday season, citing uncertainty over the economy and the impact of tariffs. Companies like American Christmas LLC and Radial are reducing their temporary workforce or delaying hiring to mitigate financial risks.

          <p>At least 153 unvaccinated students in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, are in quarantine after being exposed to measles at two local schools. This measure follows the confirmation of the state's 11th measles case this year, indicating active community transmission in the Upstate region. Health officials are urging the public to get vaccinated, as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the most effective protection against the highly contagious virus. The local outbreak is part of a larger national trend of rising measles cases, linked to vaccination rates falling below the 95% community immunity threshold.</p>

His absence will include Premier League games against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Burnley, and Sunderland, as well as two important Champions League matches against Atletico Madrid and Slavia Prague.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 young Native Americans was empowered to distribute $720,000 in grants from Newman’s Own Foundation and Novo Nordisk to address food insecurity in their communities. Organized by Native Americans in Philanthropy, the youth-led Indigenous Tomorrows Fund allowed participants to design the selection process and choose 24 finalist organizations. This rare approach cedes decision-making power to the beneficiary community, reflecting Indigenous values of self-determination. The funded projects focus on reclaiming traditional food practices and land stewardship to combat high rates of food insecurity and promote health.</p>

          <p>With Congress failing to pass a funding deal, a government shutdown is now in effect, forcing all active-duty U.S. military personnel to continue working without receiving their pay until the stalemate is resolved. While a 2019 law ensures federal employees eventually receive back pay, military pay is not guaranteed unless Congress passes separate legislation. Essential civilian Department of Defense employees will also continue to work, while others are furloughed. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA have announced plans to offer no-interest loans to affected service members.</p>

          <p>Housing experts indicate that the government shutdown is not expected to significantly disrupt the mortgage market, though some delays are possible for government-backed loans. Mortgages from private lenders should proceed as usual, but applications for loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA may experience processing slowdowns due to furloughed staff. The USDA will halt the issuance of new home loans entirely during the shutdown. Another potential issue is for homebuyers in flood zones, as the shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which is required for federally backed mortgages.</p>

          <p>While most TSA and FAA employees are deemed essential and must work during the government shutdown, a prolonged impasse could lead to significant travel disruptions. Experts warn that if the shutdown lasts for weeks, essential workers who are not being paid may begin calling in sick or seeking other employment, leading to staff shortages. This could result in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations, similar to what occurred during the 2018-2019 shutdown. The U.S. Travel Association estimates a prolonged shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has confirmed that all 74 million beneficiaries will continue to receive their monthly checks on schedule despite the government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles. However, the agency will furlough about 10% of its workforce, leading to the suspension of some non-essential services. Halted activities include benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, processing overpayments, and issuing replacement Medicare cards. The shutdown could also delay the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which is based on inflation data that may not be released on time.</p>

          <p>Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed is employing a fiery, anti-establishment populist strategy in Michigan, drawing parallels to Zohran Mamdani's successful mayoral primary campaign in New York City. El-Sayed is focusing on bold economic policies like Medicare for All and taxing the wealthy, while also taking a strong critical stance on U.S. military aid to Israel. His campaign aims to resonate with voters frustrated with the political establishment, but he faces a more challenging landscape in a swing state like Michigan. The race is being watched as a test of whether left-wing populism can succeed in statewide campaigns in the American Midwest.</p>

          <p>West Yorkshire Police have arrested a man in connection with the 1994 murder of 13-year-old Lindsay Rimer. The suspect was already incarcerated in a UK prison for other offenses when he was arrested on Monday. Lindsay disappeared in November 1994 after going to a shop in Hebden Bridge, and her body was discovered in the Rochdale Canal five months later. This is the first arrest in the case since 2017, and police are continuing the investigation while keeping Lindsay's family updated. The arrest marks a significant development in the decades-long search for justice.</p>

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs' 30-17 victory over the Detroit Lions was marred by a post-game brawl that erupted on the field. The fight began when Lions safety Brian Branch refused to shake hands with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, leading to a confrontation with Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. Branch shoved Smith-Schuster, who was left with a bloody nose, and a large scrum involving dozens of players from both teams ensued. Lions coach Dan Campbell called Branch's actions "inexcusable," while Branch admitted his behavior was "childish" but stemmed from frustration over on-field incidents.</p>

          <p>A prominent academic has suggested that China's latest trade "countermeasures" against the United States could paradoxically be a positive step toward stabilizing the relationship between the two economic giants. The argument is that these retaliatory actions might compel the Trump administration to adopt a more realistic and grounded approach in its trade negotiations with Beijing. This analysis comes as the White House has recently softened its rhetoric regarding the renewed trade tensions. Both sides still appear willing to proceed with planned meetings, indicating a potential path to de-escalation despite the recent tit-for-tat actions.</p>
