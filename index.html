          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to over seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos expressed regret for defrauding voters and betraying the institutions he swore to uphold during his tearful address to the judge. Prosecutors had requested the maximum possible sentence, citing his "brazen web of deceit," while Santos sought a shorter two-year term. The judge agreed to delay Santos' prison reporting date to allow him to earn money from his podcast to pay restitution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that tariffs imposed by President Trump would disproportionately burden the poorest U.S. households. The study projects that in 2026, taxes for the lowest 20% of households would rise significantly more than for the wealthiest 1%. Economists suggest consumers will bear some of the tax burden through higher prices. The analysis aligns with findings that Trump's tariffs are a regressive policy, negatively impacting those with lower incomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's draft budget proposal seeks to eliminate a $56 million annual grant program that distributes Narcan and trains emergency responders. The decision to cut the program, which is vital in reversing opioid overdoses, has sparked concern among addiction specialists. While other resources for obtaining Narcan exist, the elimination of the federal grant raises symbolic and practical implications. The cuts are part of a broader effort to reorganize and shrink the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

          <p>A hairdresser in East London, who has run her salon for 30 years, fears she may lose her business and home due to recent tax increases. She states that tax rises in October's Budget are "crippling" her salon business, adding an extra £23,000 a year in costs. The government says the tax changes were needed to stabilize the economy, but salon owners fear they may come too late to save their businesses. She has had to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum and will halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.</p>

          <p>Parts of England are expected to experience a mini heatwave next week, with temperatures potentially reaching 26 or even 27 degrees Celsius. High pressure to the east of the UK and low pressure to the west will draw heat from continental Europe. The warm weather is expected to persist until the end of the week.</p>

          <p>The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank were marked by uncertainty and concern over the Trump administration's policies. Policymakers expressed worries about the impact of Trump's trade policies and potential economic shocks.
