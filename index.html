          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised caution regarding the initial public offering of design software company Figma, suggesting its stock may quickly become too expensive. While praising Figma's strong business fundamentals, impressive client list, and profitability, Cramer noted its high initial valuation. He also raised concerns about the broader weakness in the enterprise software sector and the potential for AI investments to negatively impact Figma's profitability in the near term. The company recently increased its expected IPO price range, valuing it at up to $18.8 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

According to sources, Las Vegas was selected after potential venues in the other host countries were ruled out. This will be the second time the city has hosted the draw, having also done so for the 1994 World Cup, despite not being a match host city.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has highlighted the recent arrests of several immigrants with severe criminal histories across the country. The agency detailed cases including a Laotian and Thai dual citizen in Pennsylvania convicted of conspiracy to murder a teenager with a baseball bat. Other arrests involved individuals from Guatemala, Mexico, and Ecuador with convictions for offenses such as fatal hit-and-run, predatory sexual assault on a child, and child neglect. The Department of Homeland Security stated these actions reflect a priority to remove public safety threats from American communities.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," a crucial scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and allows for their regulation under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action intended to lower costs for consumers and businesses, particularly in the automotive sector. Critics and environmental scientists have condemned the decision, calling it scientifically baseless and warning of severe consequences for climate change and public health. Legal challenges are expected if the proposal is finalized.</p>

This account contrasts with previous White House statements that Trump cut ties with Epstein for being a "creep." The claim also complicates the timeline of their relationship, as Trump spoke highly of Epstein in 2002, two years after Giuffre said she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

          <p>The greater Los Angeles area saw a significant surge in venture capital funding, more than doubling to $5.8 billion in the second quarter compared to last year. This boom is largely fueled by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have increased investor interest in defense and aerospace technology startups. Defense tech company Anduril led the charge, securing a massive $2.5 billion funding round. The trend reflects a belief among investors that Southern California's established aerospace hub is ripe for disruption by innovative startups challenging industry incumbents.

          <p>Republican lawmakers in North Carolina successfully overrode several of Democratic Governor Josh Stein's vetoes by securing a few crucial votes from Democratic party members. The overrides allowed the enactment of conservative legislation targeting transgender rights, allowing firearms on private school property, and repealing a greenhouse gas reduction mandate. While the GOP fell short on other measures, such as eliminating DEI initiatives and allowing permitless concealed carry, the votes demonstrated their ability to build a "working supermajority" on certain issues, highlighting deep divisions within the state's Democratic caucus.</p>

          <p>A photo essay from The Atlantic documents the severe hunger crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip, where a blockade on most food and aid has pushed its 2 million residents to the brink of starvation. According to United Nations agencies, the situation is escalating into a full-blown famine, with mounting evidence of malnutrition and starvation-related deaths. The article notes that the limited aid that does enter is difficult to distribute, and health authorities report over 130 deaths from famine since the conflict began.

          <p>With an August 1 deadline approaching for numerous trade deals, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attempted to reassure American businesses about the potential return of high tariffs. Bessent suggested that if "snapback tariffs" are reimposed on countries without a new agreement, it would not be "the end of the world" and could be short-lived as negotiations continue. This comes as President Trump considers a blanket tariff of 15-20% on countries that have not yet secured a deal. However, import-dependent businesses, particularly small ones, remain concerned about the financial impact of the looming tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>
