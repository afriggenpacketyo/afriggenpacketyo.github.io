        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has intensified its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing formal warnings to California, New York, and Illinois. The letters demand compliance with ICE detainers, which are requests for local authorities to hold undocumented immigrants for federal custody. Citing public safety concerns, the Trump administration threatens to involve the Department of Justice to sue these states and potentially block federal funding. The states argue that detainers are non-mandatory requests and that compliance could lead to legal liability and erode community trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested following a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The incident, where at least three bullets were fired into the building's occupied lobby, resulted in no injuries. Police are currently investigating the motive, noting the shooting occurred a day after protests concerning the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, though a direct link has not been established. The station's parent company, TEGNA, has increased security and journalism organizations have condemned the act of violence against the media.</p>

          <p>The Southwestern U.S. is bracing for a renewed threat of flash flooding as monsoonal moisture moves into the region, following recent deadly floods in California. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is intensifying and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season. While Gabrielle is not projected to make direct landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast. The storm's center is anticipated to pass east of Bermuda early next week, bringing potential rain and wind impacts to the island.</p>

Cleary, a conservative lawyer, takes over an office in turmoil over claims of political interference in prosecutorial decisions. This appointment follows a contentious period where James led a successful fraud lawsuit against Trump.</p>

          <p>An armed man, Joshua Runkles, was arrested at State Farm Stadium in Arizona for impersonating a law enforcement officer ahead of a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The 42-year-old was detained by the Secret Service and local authorities after exhibiting suspicious behavior and was found to be carrying a weapon in a prohibited area. While Runkles has since been released on bond, an investigation into his motives and purpose at the high-security event is ongoing.

          <p>Dutch police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse a violent anti-immigration protest in The Hague, resulting in thirty arrests and injuries to two officers. The demonstration, organized by a right-wing activist, saw around 1,500 people block a major highway, with some protesters throwing rocks and setting a police car on fire. Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders both condemned the violence as unacceptable. The unrest highlights the intense political tensions over migration in the Netherlands, which contributed to the collapse of the previous government coalition.</p>

          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are forced to take on part-time jobs and lengthy commutes because their government maintenance loans do not cover basic living expenses. Research indicates a significant shortfall between the maximum loan amount and the actual cost of living, compelling students to work long hours, sometimes at the expense of their studies and university experience. Some students even wear work uniforms to lectures to save time between commitments, while others move back home to commute. This financial pressure highlights a worsening cost-of-living crisis for students in higher education.</p>

While some users report positive effects on mental clarity, scientific evidence is still emerging and considered limited. Experts caution that while the supplement is generally safe for healthy adults, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for cognitive function.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to recognize a Palestinian state is a significant shift in foreign policy, driven by a combination of international and domestic pressures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's move follows growing calls from within his Labour Party and from allies like France to act, amid the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. While the government frames it as a necessary step to preserve the viability of a two-state solution, critics argue it is a symbolic gesture that rewards terrorism without securing the release of hostages. The decision also reflects an attempt to manage internal party divisions and voter sentiment on the conflict.</p>

Critics pointed to Dolan's own controversial history, including his handling of clergy sexual assault cases, and rejected the comparison of Kirk to the apostle.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of five bills designed to protect California residents from federal immigration enforcement operations directed by the Trump administration. The most prominent new law, the "No Secret Police Act," bans law enforcement, including federal ICE agents, from wearing face coverings while on duty and requires them to be clearly identifiable. Other bills in the package restrict immigration enforcement access to schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant. Newsom framed the legislation as a necessary resistance against what he termed the "authoritarian tendencies" of the federal government's immigration tactics.</p>

          <p>In a significant advance for fusion energy research, scientists have for the first time observed diamond capsules undergoing shock-induced amorphization. By using powerful lasers to compress the diamonds, researchers were able to collapse their atomic structure, a key step in understanding how to create the symmetrical implosion needed for nuclear fusion. This discovery provides crucial data for controlling the extreme pressures and heat involved in the process. The research moves science closer to harnessing fusion, a potentially limitless and clean energy source that could reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

The mission follows a series of airspace violations by Russia against NATO members, which has significantly escalated regional tensions. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated the operation sends a clear signal that NATO airspace will be defended against reckless Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, launching over 600 drones and missiles against multiple regions, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. The strikes targeted critical infrastructure, residential areas, and civilian enterprises, killing at least three people and injuring dozens. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assault as a deliberate strategy of terror, not a military necessity, and called for a strong international response. While Ukraine reported that its air defenses intercepted most of the projectiles, the attack represents a significant escalation in Russia's long-range assault campaign.</p>

          <p>The White House has denied that pressure from the Trump administration led to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, despite public threats from the FCC Chairman to review ABC's broadcast license. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the decision was made independently by ABC executives because Kimmel "knowingly lied" about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel's show was pulled indefinitely after he linked the alleged killer to the MAGA movement, sparking a fierce political backlash and accusations of the administration engaging in "cancel culture" to silence critics.</p>

          <p>An undercover FBI investigation into White House border czar Tom Homan was reportedly shut down by Trump-appointed officials at the Justice Department. The probe allegedly recorded Homan in 2024 accepting $50,000 in cash from agents posing as executives, after indicating he could help them secure government contracts in a second Trump administration. According to sources, the investigation was stalled after the election and officially closed recently. The White House and FBI dismissed the probe as a baseless, politically motivated effort from the previous administration, while legal experts note that soliciting funds to influence future contracts can constitute a crime.</p>

The new strategy aims to position the party as the true voice of British values, contrasting with what they term the "plastic patriotism" of figures like Nigel Farage. This marks a significant shift for the party, which has traditionally been more reserved about overt displays of national pride.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue the case has been prejudiced by official statements, including Attorney General Pam Bondi's public call for capital punishment, and a highly publicized "perp walk" after his arrest. The defense claims these actions have tainted the legal process and violated Mangione's rights, making a fair trial impossible under the threat of execution. This legal battle is unfolding as his state-level terrorism charges were recently dismissed.</p>
