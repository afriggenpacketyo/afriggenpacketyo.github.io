          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:24:43 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled for an official visit to the Federal Reserve, a move seen as a significant escalation in his public campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first time a U.S. president has made such a visit in nearly two decades, challenging the central bank's long-standing tradition of political independence. The visit brings Trump's persistent criticism of the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates directly to the institution's leadership. This action symbolizes a direct confrontation with the established autonomy of the nation's monetary policy authority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed Customs and Border Protection to offer unaccompanied migrant teens aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This policy change, previously limited to children from Mexico and Canada, upends a 2008 anti-trafficking law that provided special protections for minors from noncontiguous countries by mandating their transfer to HHS shelters. The Department of Homeland Security stated the change was enabled by new spending law authorities. The number of migrants affected may be limited due to a significant drop in border crossings.</p>

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of water pollution tests over the last three months due to significant staff shortages at its main laboratory. The suspended tests were designed to detect inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which are indicators of sewage or agricultural runoff in rivers, lakes, and estuaries. Critics and former employees express concern that the lack of routine monitoring could prevent the timely identification of environmental problems and toxic substances. The EA acknowledged operating below capacity but stated its overall testing program remains robust despite the cuts.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are in Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations with China, though the summit is shadowed by significant disagreements. Key points of contention include trade imbalances, uneven market access for EU firms, and China's industrial subsidies, as well as geopolitical issues like the war in Ukraine. Despite Chinese state media emphasizing partnership, the relationship is strained, with Brussels viewing the talks as an opportunity for frank discussion. The summit occurs as both blocs navigate a challenging global landscape, including an aggressive U.S. trade strategy.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into an armed exchange of fire at a disputed border area near the Ta Muen Thom temple. Both nations have accused the other of initiating the hostilities, with Cambodia claiming its troops acted in self-defense to protect its territorial integrity. The clash follows a recent landmine incident that injured a Thai soldier and led to Thailand recalling its ambassador. This event marks a significant deterioration in bilateral relations, which are now at their worst in over a decade amid increased military presence from both sides.</p>

          <p>A Scripps Institution of Oceanography researcher discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically found in the area. These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, usually inhabit warmer subtropical seas. This is the first sighting by Scripps researchers in a decade and coincides with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists suggest that continued warm water trends could lead to more frequent appearances of such species, prompting further study.</p>

The company projects that HBM sales for the full year will double compared to 2024. Despite intense competition from rivals Samsung and Micron, SK Hynix is solidifying its market leadership and plans to increase capital expenditure to meet future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Formed in working-class Birmingham, the band reacted against the 'hippy' music of the era by creating a darker, heavier sound that would define the heavy metal genre. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, was central to their sound, characterized by detuned, powerful riffs. Despite initial critical dismissal and controversy over their supposedly satanic imagery, Black Sabbath's music, from 'Paranoid' to 'War Pigs,' established an enduring and influential legacy.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts remain cautious, suggesting the growth pace is unlikely to last due to softening global trade and the looming threat of tariffs on the country's externally-facing sectors.

          <p>An investigation is underway into how classified information about a U.S. military strike in Yemen was allegedly shared on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's personal Signal account. The information, marked 'SECRET/NOFORN,' included operational details such as takeoff times and when bombs were scheduled to hit targets. This disclosure undercuts the Pentagon's insistence that no classified data was shared on the commercial app. The incident has raised serious concerns about operational security and the handling of sensitive military intelligence at the highest levels of the Department of Defense, prompting a review by the Inspector General.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old teacher from San Francisco, Nicholas Pellegrino, is returning to the U.S. after surviving a violent attack and robbery at a train station in Milan, Italy. Pellegrino was slashed in the throat with a pocketknife by a group of men who also stole his belongings, including his passport and a gold cross. He sustained a life-threatening injury to his jugular vein but received emergency medical care. Italian authorities have since arrested four suspects, identified as North African migrants, in connection with the attack, which was reportedly one of several they committed in a short period.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed three executive orders as part of a new 'AI Action Plan' aimed at cementing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. One order targets what the White House calls 'woke Marxist lunacy,' requiring AI companies with federal funding to maintain politically neutral models free from 'ideological dogmas such as DEI.' Other orders focus on expediting permits for data center construction and promoting the export of American AI technology. The plan emphasizes deregulation to spur innovation, a move that critics argue prioritizes corporate interests over public safety and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, imposing a 19 percent tariff on imports from these nations while ensuring American exports face no duties. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and potentially accessing rare earth mineral reserves. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is debated, as Chinese companies have been proactively localizing their production within Southeast Asia for years. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment routes that previous U.S. trade policies have targeted. (not investment advice)</p>

Firefighters, with the assistance of aircraft and bulldozers creating containment lines, were able to stop the forward rate of spread by the evening. As of early evening, the fire was not yet contained, and no evacuation orders had been issued for the surrounding areas.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track for its highest number of annual deportations in a decade. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting a total over 300,000 for the year, a level not seen since the Obama administration in 2014. This increase reflects the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, including expanded funding and a broader mandate for arrests. However, this pace still falls significantly short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational challenges of such a large-scale effort.</p>
