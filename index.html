          <p>A 48-year-old man in Japan was apprehended after allegedly breaking into a cram school naked and committing a series of crimes in the Tokyo area. Daisuke Nishimura is suspected of hit-and-runs, theft, and assault, resulting in one death and injuries to about a dozen people. The incidents occurred within a 90-minute period, starting with reports of a tattooed man driving erratically and culminating in his arrest at the cram school after assaulting a teacher and grabbing a student. Police believe Nishimura may be connected to approximately 20 similar incidents in the area.</p>

          <p>The European Union has levied significant fines against Apple and Meta for violating the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple was fined 500 million euros for failing to comply with anti-steering obligations, which require the company to allow developers to inform customers of alternative offers outside the App Store. Meta received a 200 million euro fine for similar breaches. Apple plans to appeal the EU fine, arguing that the decision unfairly targets the company and harms user privacy and product security.</p>

          <p>Cable companies like Comcast and Charter are increasingly prioritizing mobile services as a significant financial driver and growth opportunity. Once primarily known for pay TV and landline services, these companies are now focusing on home internet and mobile phone offerings.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that U.S. tariffs will contribute to a slight decrease in the country's fiscal deficit in 2025, despite a worsening outlook for U.S. growth and inflation due to an intensifying trade war. The IMF's Fiscal Monitor report projects the U.S.'s overall federal deficit will fall to 6.5% of gross domestic product this year, down from 7.3% in 2024, contingent on higher tariff revenues. The report acknowledges uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of the tariff revenue increase and potential risks to the forecast.</p>

          <p>The European Union is considering a proposal to impose export restrictions on all eel species under an international agreement regulating trade in endangered species. If approved, the proposal would place Japanese eel, among other species, on the list requiring an export permit issued by the exporting country. The EU argues that this measure is necessary for effective enforcement, given the ongoing smuggling of European eels. Japan's Fisheries Agency is lobbying the EU to forgo the proposal and plans to oppose it if submitted.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich is facing increasing pressure regarding its sponsorship deal with Rwanda, particularly due to allegations of Rwanda's involvement in conflicts in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite promising to investigate the sponsorship, the club has remained silent, drawing criticism from fans and human rights groups. Other clubs associated with Rwanda, such as Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, are also facing scrutiny. The German government has restricted its bilateral cooperation agreement with Rwanda, adding further pressure on Bayern Munich.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted college loan payments from millions of borrowers could contribute to an economic slowdown. Approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections starting in May. This will involve wage garnishments, potentially reducing consumer spending and damaging credit scores. While the impact may be smaller than other economic factors, it could compound the damage if the economy enters a downturn.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is experiencing a surge in price, heading towards $95,000, as part of a broader market relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and rhetoric against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The price of Bitcoin has risen, giving back more than half of its losses since Inauguration Day and hovering just under the flat line for the year. Market analysts suggest this reflects a market seizing the opportunity to capitalize on a dip in an asset considered a compelling option for portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

While AI is driving demand for data centers that in turn are creating demand for more energy, the author argues that it's important not to panic about AI's energy use just yet. The author highlights the uncertainty about how data center energy demand will grow and that computing is getting more efficient. The article also notes that AI tools can have their own environmental benefits and that tech companies need to continue pulling on the efficiency lever.</p>
