          <p>During closing arguments in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, his defense attorney, Marc Agnifilo, characterized the prosecution as a "fake trial" and an overreach into the music mogul's private life. Agnifilo argued that the government exaggerated Combs' swinger lifestyle and recreational drug use to construct a racketeering conspiracy case, asserting that the charges were not supported by witness testimony. The defense claimed the case was primarily motivated by money following a civil lawsuit and rested its case without calling any witnesses to the stand. Prosecutors countered that Combs used his power and influence to facilitate and conceal serious crimes.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with a group of Maryland parents, affirming their right to opt their elementary-aged children out of classroom instruction involving storybooks about gender identity and sexuality. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that the school district's refusal to allow opt-outs substantially burdened the parents' First Amendment right to guide their children's religious upbringing. This ruling reverses lower court decisions and requires the Montgomery County school board to permit students to be excused from the lessons in question, which feature LGBTQ-inclusive narratives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue sweeping nationwide injunctions, ruling 6-3 in a case related to a Trump administration birthright citizenship policy. Authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the majority opinion argues that such universal orders often exceed the authority Congress has granted to federal courts. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, the decision restricts injunctions to apply only to the specific plaintiffs in a case, significantly curbing a tool used to block executive policies. Justice Sotomayor's dissent warned that the ruling creates a legal regime where "no right is safe."</p>

          <p>Recent diplomatic engagements, particularly the NATO summit in The Hague, have sparked commentary on the obsequious approach some European leaders are taking toward U.S. President Donald Trump. Critics have described the praise from figures like NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte as an "orchestrated grovel" designed to placate the president and achieve policy goals, such as increased defense spending. Some analysts argue this strategy of flattery is a pragmatic way to manage Trump's transactional style of leadership. Others contend that it signals weakness, demeans the alliance, and ultimately earns disdain rather than respect from the U.S. administration.</p>

The initial plan would have applied stricter criteria for receiving Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefits to all claimants. After facing a significant backbench rebellion, the government amended the bill so the new, stricter rules will only apply to new claimants, protecting the 3.7 million current recipients. Starmer stated the revised package strikes the "right balance," though some MPs on the left of the party still plan to vote against the proposals.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns over inflation, tariffs, and market volatility, Americans are shifting from "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," significantly increasing their personal savings. The U.S. personal saving rate rose to 4.5% in May, up from 3.5% in December, as consumers prioritize building emergency funds and pare back discretionary spending. This cautious behavior is also reflected in retirement savings, with 401(k) contribution rates hitting a record high in the first quarter of 2025. Financial experts say this trend indicates a defensive consumer mindset, preparing for potential future economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, candidate Zohran Mamdani has faced social media claims of antisemitism and Islamist extremism. A fact-check found no evidence that Mamdani has advocated for Sharia law; on the contrary, he has supported LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive freedoms, positions often at odds with conservative Islamic law. Allegations of antisemitism are more complex, stemming from his criticism of Israeli government policies and support for the BDS movement. While these views are controversial, they do not conclusively meet a universal definition of antisemitism, as Mamdani has also worked with Jewish politicians and condemned antisemitism.</p>

The launch highlights Tesla's unique camera-based approach to autonomous driving, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar, and it demonstrates the significant challenges still remaining before full autonomy is achieved.</p>

Experts note that despite increased seizures, street prices have remained stable or even fallen, indicating a massive surge in supply.

The author, a former political prisoner, recounts experiences of being moved through unmarked buildings, secret offices, and interrogation rooms hidden in plain sight within ordinary neighborhoods. This hidden infrastructure of control, from Evin Prison to disguised safe houses, represents the regime's power, which operates parallel to the vibrant, public life of Tehran's citizens. Recent Israeli airstrikes, the author argues, have briefly illuminated this invisible network, exposing the deep integration of military and intelligence assets within the city's civilian fabric.</p>
