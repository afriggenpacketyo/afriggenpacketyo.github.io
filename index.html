            <p>Danish shoppers are protesting President Trump's stance on Greenland and trade tariffs by boycotting U.S. products, with some stores labeling European-owned brands to facilitate the boycott. This consumer action reflects broader sentiment, as travel data indicates a decline in trips to the U.S. from Canada. Despite the protests, some consumers prioritize deals over political statements, suggesting that the boycott's long-term impact may be limited as consumers revert to normal habits. The situation underscores the interconnectedness of political tensions and consumer behavior in the global marketplace.</p>

            <p>China has responded to U.S. tariffs by raising levies on American goods to 125%, stating that further U.S. tariff increases would be economically meaningless. While refraining from additional export controls, China reiterated its openness to negotiations on an equal footing. Despite the escalation, analysts suggest that bilateral tariff rates have reached their peak, with the next step being an evaluation of the economic damage.

            <p>Betty Brown, a 92-year-old victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal, has rejected a revised compensation offer, deeming it insufficient after losing over £50,000 due to faulty software. The Horizon IT system wrongly accused over 900 sub-postmasters of theft, leading to prosecutions and jail time. Despite over £892m being paid to claimants, MPs criticize the slow pace of compensation, and Brown's case highlights ongoing disputes over fair redress. The Post Office Minister understands the frustration when lawyers are not able to reach an agreement on a claim.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is invoking the McCarran-Walter Act, a Cold War-era law, to potentially deport pro-Palestinian student protesters, arguing their actions affect American foreign policy. This law allows deportation of non-citizens whose activities are deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences. Critics argue this infringes on free speech rights, while the administration asserts non-citizens have limited free speech. The law, originally designed to target communists, has a history of being used to enforce racial and ethnic immigration quotas, raising concerns about its current application.</p>

            <p>Congressional Democrats are facing criticism for opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, which is aimed at eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending. DOGE's findings, such as identifying Social Security numbers given to non-citizens, have been met with denials and personal attacks from Democrats. Critics argue that Democrats' opposition to DOGE's efforts suggests they are in favor of fraud and waste, undermining their credibility with voters.

Internally, provinces are working to reduce trade barriers, and the country may see a reversal of the brain drain as skilled workers choose Canada over the U.S. Politically, Trump's actions have weakened pro-Trump candidates in Canada, leading to a re-evaluation of the country's role in the world.</p>

            <p>Despite a pause on some reciprocal tariffs, Apple faces challenges due to its heavy reliance on supply chains in China, where tariffs continue to rise. Analysts warn that Apple could be significantly set back by these tariffs, as nearly 80% of iPhones shipped to the U.S. come from China. Under current tariffs, Apple may be forced to increase prices by around 85% to maintain its margins, making U.S.-China negotiations crucial for the company's future.</p>

            <p>Colorado's governor has signed a bill requiring background checks and safety courses for purchasing most semiautomatic guns with detachable magazines. The law, effective in August 2026, aims to reduce gun violence in a state that has experienced several mass shootings. Republicans argue the measure violates the Second Amendment, while proponents say it will save lives. The law is a watered-down version of a proposed ban on certain semiautomatic guns, reflecting the state's political landscape.</p>

            <p>Republicans face challenges in drafting legislation to implement their budget plan, requiring them to balance spending cuts with the reelection prospects of vulnerable lawmakers. With thin majorities in both the House and Senate, Republicans can afford to lose few votes, giving individual lawmakers leverage over the process. Democrats are framing the debate as Republicans seeking to slash government programs to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. The road ahead is daunting, as Republicans must navigate internal divisions and external opposition.</p>
