          <p>A Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of mismanaging an "ostentatious" office renovation, suggesting potential legal violations. This criticism follows months of President Trump's attacks on Powell for not cutting interest rates, which the administration believes would stimulate the economy. The letter from the Office of Management and Budget questions changes to the renovation plan and its escalating costs, while Powell has previously testified that descriptions of the project were inaccurate. This action intensifies the political pressure on the traditionally independent Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Columbia University trustee, Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, is publicly calling for the university's board to fully comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding antisemitism and Title VI. In a letter, she criticized the university's leadership for a perceived lack of moral clarity and failure to protect Jewish students, which has led to significant legal and financial repercussions. The call for compliance comes amid controversy over released text messages from the acting school president suggesting Shendelman's removal from the board. Columbia leadership has since apologized and affirmed its commitment to combating antisemitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced executive actions to increase logging on federal lands, framing the policy as a way to boost timber production and reduce wildfire risks. This has drawn mixed reactions in places like Oregon, where timber towns welcome the move, but environmental groups express alarm over potential deregulation and harm to forests. Critics, including former Forest Service employees, worry that federal agencies lack the staffing to implement such projects properly while adhering to environmental laws. The debate highlights the deep-seated conflict between economic interests and environmental protection in managing public lands.</p>

          <p>In Wilmington, Los Angeles, 31 construction workers were successfully rescued after a tunnel they were working in collapsed, trapping them underground. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's Clearwater Project, a major infrastructure initiative. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, ensured all workers were brought to safety without any visible injuries.

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for successful political slogans by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. The research suggests eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—resonate universally with voters by acting as emotional shortcuts. While not a guarantee of victory, these words serve as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging across different cultures and political ideologies. The analysis also notes the rise of bespoke, issue-specific slogans and the increasing use of AI to craft personalized messages for individual voters.</p>

The analysis contrasts the current, widespread heat events with the more isolated 1976 heatwave, demonstrating that what was once a rare occurrence is becoming a regular feature of British summers.

          <p>Clashes erupted between federal immigration agents and protesters during a large-scale raid at an agricultural farm in Ventura County, Southern California. Onlookers and activists confronted masked federal agents, who were seen using crowd control measures and detaining at least one person. The incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement actions in the region, which has heightened tensions and fear within communities. This follows a recent operation in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park, which the mayor criticized as a political act intended to provoke fear.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel following an internal investigation into the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania last year. A report released by the agency acknowledged the event as an "operational failure" and detailed the disciplinary actions, which include suspensions without pay. The Secret Service stated it is accountable for the security lapses and has already implemented reforms, such as improved technology and clearer lines of accountability, to prevent future incidents. The attack resulted in the death of one rally attendee and prompted the resignation of the agency's director.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals an alarming trend: the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the rise in average global temperatures. This non-linear acceleration means that even small increments of global warming will have a disproportionately large impact, making the longest and most extreme heat waves significantly more frequent. The findings underscore the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to protect people, agriculture, and infrastructure from the growing threat of prolonged, intense heat. Researchers warn that defunding climate science will limit the ability to make crucial region-specific projections for risk management.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration has announced that children without legal immigration status will be excluded from Head Start, the federal preschool program for low-income families. The move reclassifies Head Start and at least a dozen other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby restricting access for undocumented immigrants. Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn that this will create fear and confusion among all families and deny vulnerable children access to crucial early education and nutrition. The policy is seen as part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants.</p>
