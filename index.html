          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded with a friendly tone but no concrete deal on the Ukraine conflict. The article notes Trump's brief, four-minute press statement and his uncharacteristic deference to Putin, who used the platform to promote Russia's security narrative. Observers question the extent to which the Russian perspective influenced Trump, who later suggested that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is now responsible for reaching an agreement with Moscow. The summit raised more questions than answers regarding future steps toward peace and the nature of any backroom discussions.</p>

          <p>Bob Simpson, a celebrated former captain and transformative coach for the Australian national cricket team, has passed away at the age of 89. Simpson's distinguished career included 62 Test matches as a player and a remarkable comeback at age 41 to lead the team during the World Series Cricket era. As a coach starting in 1986, he is credited with reviving Australian cricket, leading the team to a 1987 World Cup victory and laying the groundwork for a generation of dominance by mentoring future legends.

          <p>The upcoming heavyweight boxing match between 20-year-old rising star Moses Itauma and veteran Dillian Whyte is being framed as a pivotal career test for both fighters. Itauma, undefeated and viewed as a future champion, faces his most experienced opponent yet in the 37-year-old Whyte, who has fought top names like Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua. A panel of boxing experts largely favors Itauma, citing his speed, youth, and momentum against Whyte's recent inactivity and age. They predict that while Whyte's experience makes him dangerous, the fight is perfectly timed for Itauma to secure a career-defining victory.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump engaged in phone calls with NATO leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In a subsequent interview with Fox News, Trump provided little new detail about the negotiations but reiterated that significant items remain unresolved. He stated that the onus is now on President Zelenskyy and European nations to finalize an agreement with Moscow. When asked for his advice to the Ukrainian leader, Trump was direct, stating, "Gotta make the deal," emphasizing Russia's status as a major power.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are publicly voicing concerns about the sustainability of the United States' expanding national debt, leading to calls for Beijing to reduce its holdings of U.S. dollar assets. China has already been decreasing its ownership of U.S. Treasuries, which in June reached their lowest point since 2009. The article from a central bank-supervised publication suggests that while a U.S. default is not imminent, the current trajectory is unsustainable. The researchers advocate for gradually adjusting Treasury holdings while increasing reserves of gold and other strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains have resulted in the deaths of more than 300 people across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been hit hardest, with numerous homes damaged and a rescue helicopter crashing, killing its five crew members. Authorities have declared disaster zones in several areas as forecasters predict the intense rainfall will continue. Survivors described the deluge as apocalyptic, and scientists attribute the increasing frequency and extremity of such weather events to climate change, which exacerbates the annual monsoon season's impact.</p>

The superheavy Long March-10 is designed to carry 27 tonnes to a trans-lunar orbit and is central to China's plan to land astronauts on the moon by 2030.

          <p>A high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a significant breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. While Trump described the talks as "productive," he acknowledged that key issues remain unresolved and that the final steps are up to Ukraine and its allies. Putin called the discussions a "starting point" for resolving the conflict and improving U.S.-Russia relations, which he said are at a post-Cold War low. The summit was viewed as a diplomatic victory in Russia, while Ukraine expressed apprehension about potential deals being made without its direct involvement.</p>

          <p>This article offers a critical analysis of the dynamic between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at their Alaska summit, portraying it as a strategic success for the Russian leader. It argues that Putin effectively "romanced" Trump by validating his grievances, particularly by endorsing the claim that the 2020 U.S. election was rigged and that the Ukraine war would not have happened under a Trump presidency. The piece highlights Trump's deferential posture and the symbolism of the warm reception for Putin, who is under indictment for war crimes.

          <p>This article breaks down the recent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin into five key observations, starting with the symbolic victory for Putin in being welcomed back onto the world stage with a red-carpet reception on U.S. soil. It notes that while no concrete deal on Ukraine was announced, Putin reiterated his maximalist demands by referencing the need to eliminate the "root causes" of the conflict. The analysis also points out the unusual brevity and vagueness of Trump's statement, in which he failed to mention Ukraine by name.

          <p>Taiwan is proposing significant changes to its residency rules for mainland Chinese nationals, a move critics are calling an "attack" on cross-strait spouses. The new policy, part of President Lai Ching-te's strategy to counter threats from Beijing, would require applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. The government argues these measures are necessary to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that could pose national security risks amid escalating tensions. The amendment marks a sharp turn in cross-strait governance and reflects a tougher stance on identity and security under the new administration.</p>

The analysis shows the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio has reached a record high of 5.3, exceeding the peak of 5.1 seen during the dot-com bubble in March 2000. While high valuations reflect strong expectations for future AI-driven earnings, they also signal potential froth in the market.

The proposed maps would significantly alter several GOP-held districts to create strong Democratic voter advantages.

He told investigators that staff never properly searched the trash cans where he hid his materials. The escape led to the firing of two employees and highlighted significant procedural failures, including Hardin's misclassification at a medium-security facility, prompting calls for systemic security reforms.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court hearing, the U.S. Justice Department has agreed to remove its newly appointed emergency police chief for Washington D.C. and rewrite a directive that would have ended the city's "sanctuary" policies. The city had sued the Trump administration, arguing that its takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department and its orders to force cooperation with federal immigration authorities were illegal. While D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, the revised federal directive will still be negotiated, with a judge indicating that the mayor must comply with lawful presidential requests for police services but that a full takeover is likely unconstitutional.</p>
