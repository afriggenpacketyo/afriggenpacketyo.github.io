        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ofcom has announced new regulations requiring tech firms to implement age verification checks and adjust algorithms to filter harmful content, aiming to protect children online. Social media platforms and websites must legally shield children from harmful content or face potential fines. Critics, however, argue the restrictions don't go far enough, while others see it as a positive step with tech companies investing resources into child safety. The regulations also mandate streamlined reporting systems and the appointment of a dedicated person accountable for children's safety, with annual risk reviews by senior management.</p>

Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law received substantial salary and allowances from the airline, which they consider a bribe paid by a businessman and former lawmaker who controlled the airline. The indictment claims the son-in-law was given an executive position as a favor to Moon's family, despite lacking the necessary qualifications, continuing a pattern of criminal investigations into former South Korean leaders.</p>

          <p>Starting April 2026, Japan will enforce a revised road traffic law, imposing fines on cyclists aged 16 and older for minor traffic violations such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights.

The fines range from 3,000 to 12,000 yen depending on the offense, and this initiative follows previous measures to reduce bicycle-related accidents, including penalties for cycling under the influence of alcohol.</p>

While existing laws like the Online Safety Act deem such videos illegal, Fergus believes they are insufficient to force platforms to remove harmful content and prevent the misuse of AI for these purposes. The government has acknowledged the vile nature of using technology for these purposes and says it will take further action if needed.</p>

          <p>China is reshaping the global scientific publishing landscape through its updated Journal Ranking Table, which prioritizes domestic journals and adjusts the evaluation criteria for international publications. This ranking system, used to assess researcher output and promotions, has downgraded some established international journals while elevating domestic Chinese journals. This move signals an attempt by Beijing to enhance its scientific soft power by showcasing its growing research capabilities and influence within the global scientific community.</p>
