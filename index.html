        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade agreement, a process that was reportedly expedited by the tariff policies of the U.S. Trump administration. The deal will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and pharmaceuticals while opening investment in sectors such as electric vehicles. For Indonesia, the pact offers tariff-free access to the EU for about 80% of its exports, including palm oil and textiles. This agreement marks the EU's third such deal with a Southeast Asian nation, following those with Singapore and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended the production shutdown at its factories until at least October 1 following a significant cyber attack in late August. The attack forced the company to shut down its IT networks, halting car production and raising serious concerns about the financial stability of its supply chain. Government officials are meeting with JLR and its suppliers to address the crisis, as fears grow that smaller firms in the supply chain could face bankruptcy without support. The full extent of the disruption and the timeline for a complete recovery remain uncertain.</p>

The focus has been amplified following recent recognitions of a Palestinian state by several European nations, including France and Belgium. This diplomatic shift is increasing political pressure on other countries, such as Germany, to reconsider their long-held positions on the matter. The discussions are taking place as the UN itself grapples with financial challenges and questions about its relevance on its 80th anniversary.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has granted an injunction that overturns a Trump administration stop-work order, allowing Danish renewables firm Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. The nearly completed offshore wind farm is located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. This legal victory provides a significant reprieve for the company, which has been impacted by the administration's policies against wind power projects. Following the news, Orsted's shares jumped by more than 6% in morning trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's claim blaming Tylenol for rising autism rates, this article examines the broad scientific consensus on the matter. Medical experts assert that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder linked to a combination of genetic risks and potential environmental factors, not a single medication. The documented increase in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to greater public awareness, improved screening, and broader diagnostic criteria. The article also reinforces the thoroughly debunked nature of claims linking vaccines to autism, highlighting the importance of scientific evidence in public health discussions.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service has introduced a new patient safety initiative called "Jess's Rule," named after Jessica Brady, who died from cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed. The rule is a strong reminder for general practitioners to adopt a "three strikes and rethink approach." This means if a patient attends three appointments for the same symptoms without a clear diagnosis or with worsening conditions, the GP should reconsider the diagnosis, order more tests, seek a second opinion, or make a specialist referral to prevent avoidable deaths.</p>

Kickers and backup quarterbacks emerged as unexpected heroes in several contests. In a stunning comeback, the unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles blocked a game-winning field goal attempt by the Los Angeles Rams and returned it for a touchdown. Another major upset saw the Cleveland Browns defeat the Green Bay Packers with a 55-yard field goal as time expired, capping a day of thrilling and unpredictable football across the league.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writing in response to recent political claims, Australian paediatrician Dr. Mike Freelander provides an expert opinion on the safety of paracetamol (Tylenol) during pregnancy. He firmly states that there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between the medication and autism, explaining that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Dr. Freelander emphasizes that large, credible studies have disproven such a connection and warns that unscientific claims can cause significant distress. He urges the public to trust reliable medical regulatory bodies, which classify paracetamol as safe for use in pregnancy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed the large-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized resale websites charge exorbitant prices. The report highlights the case of a fan from South Korea who paid £900 for a ticket to a Brighton vs. Spurs match, only to be denied entry because the ticket was illegitimate. In response, Brighton is using new technology to identify and cancel touted tickets, blocking hundreds for that single game. Football supporter groups describe the issue as endemic, as it prices out long-term fans and leaves others out of pocket.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Beijing, U.S. Representative Adam Smith, the senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, emphasized the critical need for regular communication between the U.S. and Chinese militaries.

Smith argued that as China's military capabilities rapidly expand, especially in areas like AI and cyberspace, direct engagement is essential for deconfliction and maintaining global stability.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The administration had previously frozen the funds, which were primarily designated for medical research projects, citing allegations of civil rights violations at the university. In granting the preliminary injunction, the judge ruled that the government likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific procedures and explanations for the funding cuts, a tactic the administration has used to pressure several elite universities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This sports analysis suggests that tactical trends in modern football are increasingly mirroring the direct, pragmatic style famously associated with manager Sam Allardyce. The article notes a growing emphasis on set-pieces, long passes from the goalkeeper, and the use of a physical striker, all hallmarks of the 'Big Sam' playbook that was once heavily criticized. As teams move away from a strict possession-based philosophy, the piece argues that Allardyce's data-driven and results-oriented approach was ahead of its time and is now being vindicated by some of the sport's top coaches.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation offers a rare glimpse into the lives of asylum seekers in UK hotels, uncovering difficult and often unsafe living conditions. The report documents families resorting to cooking illegally on makeshift stoves in their rooms because the provided food is inedible, and children having no adequate space to play. It also highlights systemic issues, including some residents working illegally to repay people-smugglers and an over-reliance on costly taxis for essential travel. The findings paint a grim picture of a temporary system struggling to cope, with thousands housed in unsuitable accommodations for extended periods.</p>

The sales are for the fourth quarter, a period traditionally dominated by U.S. soybean exports, highlighting the profound impact of geopolitical tensions on global agricultural trade flows.

Israel strongly rejects this charge, calling it antisemitic and maintaining that its actions are a legitimate act of self-defense against Hamas.
