          <p>Russia has cautioned that any military intervention by the United States in Iran would be a dangerous move with unpredictable consequences, as stated by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. She also addressed the ongoing Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, expressing particular concern for facilities where Russian specialists are working. Zakharova urged Israel to cease these raids immediately and emphasized the need to prevent further escalation, achieve a ceasefire, and restore peace through negotiations. Russia has offered to contribute to these efforts through political and diplomatic means.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has advocated for diplomatic negotiations to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict, while Conservative figures like Dame Priti Patel have urged the UK government to support the US if it attacks Iran. Reports indicate that Britain's top legal advisor, Lord Hermer, has privately raised concerns about the legality of UK involvement under international law, potentially restricting governmental support for any US action. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to discuss the matter with his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, and Iran's foreign minister has confirmed plans for talks with counterparts from the UK, France, and Germany. Amidst these discussions, the Conservatives have stated they would support the government assisting the US in Iran.</p>

          <p>Kylian Mbappe, Real Madrid's forward, has been hospitalized with gastroenteritis, causing him to miss the Club World Cup opener against Al-Hilal. The 26-year-old player had been experiencing a fever and was excluded from the team before doctors determined the need for medical intervention. Gastroenteritis is an infection affecting the gut, leading to symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, which may have contributed to his exclusion from the lineup.

          <p>Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S., is being celebrated for the fourth year as a federally recognized holiday, but with some corporate sponsors tapering their support amid broader political efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Despite funding changes, communities across the country are still holding festivities, including parades, parties, and cultural events. The holiday's name combines June and nineteenth, marking the date in 1865 when the last enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. The holiday serves as an anniversary of independence and an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <p>International calls for restraint are being ignored as the world prepares for an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. The White House is under scrutiny as President Trump considers direct military strikes on Iran, which would significantly deepen U.S. involvement. The Kremlin has warned that U.S. intervention would trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," while other countries are taking steps to protect their citizens. Diplomatic efforts appear increasingly unlikely as both Iran and Israel continue to exchange deadly blows, with leaders showing no signs of backing down.</p>

          <p>More individuals filing for bankruptcy are carrying retail credit card debt, which is becoming increasingly difficult to pay off due to record-high interest rates. Retail credit cards typically have higher interest rates than traditional cards, and these rates have reached an all-time high of 30.45%. As a result, consumers are struggling to manage their debt, leading to a rise in bankruptcy filings involving retail credit card debt. Industry trade groups maintain that retail credit cards help consumers manage expenses and build credit, but data suggests otherwise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirement professionals are advising seniors to avoid common mistakes when considering annuities, including not understanding fees, choosing the wrong type of annuity, failing to designate a beneficiary, and withdrawing excessive funds. Annuities offer steady income in retirement, but can be complex, requiring careful consideration of the contract's fine print. Experts recommend understanding the fees, aligning the annuity type with financial goals, designating a beneficiary to ensure benefits pass to loved ones, and avoiding excessive withdrawals to maintain long-term retirement income. Annuities should be viewed as part of an overall financial strategy, rather than a complete solution. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that while Juneteenth was codified during a purported transformation in Americaâ€™s racial consciousness, the election of Donald Trump to a second term has signaled a national retreat from racial egalitarianism. Policies and structures that made progress possible are being dismantled, and the holiday now stands in stark contrast to the ongoing rollback of civil rights.
