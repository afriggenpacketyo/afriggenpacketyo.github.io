          <p>After 36 years, investigators identified Marina Ramos as the woman found murdered in the Arizona desert in 1989, leading to the discovery of her two infant daughters. Ramos's DNA, cross-referenced with old fingerprints, helped identify her and subsequently locate her children, Elizabeth and Jasmin, who were abandoned in a California park two days after their mother's death. The girls were adopted and raised together, bringing a resolution to their mysterious past, though the search for Ramos's killers continues. This article details the long-awaited breakthrough in a cold case.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off for a "stupid" shirt-removal celebration after scoring the winning goal in a Carabao Cup match, according to manager Arne Slot. Ekitike, who had already received a yellow card, apologized on social media, acknowledging his emotions got the better of him. This incident means the £69m signing will be suspended for an upcoming Premier League game, a setback for the in-form player. Slot emphasized that such a celebratory action is unwise, especially with a prior booking, and expressed confidence Ekitike would learn from the mistake.</p>

          <p>Aakash Singh, an associate deputy attorney general leading aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes in Washington D.C., pleaded guilty to driving under the influence four years ago. Experts note his promotion to a high-ranking Department of Justice post is unusual given his criminal history, which typically faces strict scrutiny. Singh has instructed attorneys to prioritize misdemeanor charges and even suggested impaneling new grand juries if indictments fail. The Justice Department defended Singh, citing his role in the President's "America First agenda," while critics highlight potential hypocrisy given the department's firing of others for minor offenses.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office rejected President Trump's "bigoted" claims made at the UN General Assembly, where Trump falsely suggested London was moving towards Sharia law. Trump's comments echoed far-right conspiracy theories linking Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, to Islamic fundamentalism, despite no evidence. Khan's spokesperson affirmed London as a global city, safer than major US cities, and welcomed American residents.

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a groundbreaking scholar of Chinese law and a consistent critic of its system, has died at 95. As professor emeritus at NYU Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen was the first American to practice law in Communist China in 1960. His extensive writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law are widely regarded, and he was known for advocating for Chinese dissidents while promoting engagement with Beijing. Cohen's profound influence shaped global debates on China's legal system for over six decades.</p>

          <p>Following the 2024 presidential election, spurious online claims of fraud, alleging Kamala Harris actually won, are flourishing, mirroring theories from the 2020 election. These theories, often using elaborate but flawed statistical analyses or unsubstantiated claims from alleged former intelligence officers, lack credible evidence. Elections experts highlight the striking similarity in the poor methodology of these new claims to those debunked previously. Despite state audits and the logistical impossibility of widespread, undetected multi-party conspiracies, such theories persist, often appealing to those struggling to accept electoral outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently made a dramatic shift in his foreign policy, suggesting Ukraine could win back all its territory, a stark contrast to his previous stance. This change followed meetings with Ukrainian and French leaders at the UN General Assembly, where he also advocated for NATO to shoot down Russian aircraft. The article questions the sincerity of this reversal, suggesting it might be a "tantrum" or a way to disengage from the conflict, rather than a genuine commitment to bolstering Ukraine. Trump's past unpredictability and lack of concrete action items for Ukraine's war effort further complicate the interpretation of his new position.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, now awaiting the governor's signature, seeks to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. Inspired by a new mother's frustration with ads waking her baby, the legislation would prohibit commercials from being louder than the programming they accompany. This expands on the existing federal CALM Act, which applies to broadcast, satellite, and cable TV but not streaming. While streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill, they became neutral after an amendment removed the ability for private lawsuits.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is addressing the urgent cash needs of local governments, which are grappling with financial woes. Recent actions, such as Hubei province forcing a resident to pay $200,000 in back taxes on undeclared overseas income, signal a wider clampdown on tax enforcement. While China has long required tax on foreign earnings, enforcement was previously lax.

Harris, promoting her memoir, stated she "didn't fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference" between them. Emanuel argued this indicated a fundamental misunderstanding of the election's major fault lines, where voters sought change. He highlighted her campaign's initial surge when she embraced change, followed by a decline when she returned to continuity with Biden.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is rehiring hundreds of federal employees laid off during an aggressive cost-cutting initiative by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These General Services Administration (GSA) employees, who managed government workspaces, were dismissed as part of a push to reduce the federal workforce. However, the downsizing left the agency understaffed and led to high costs due to mishandled property leases. Democrats criticize the "indiscriminate" approach, arguing it created costly confusion without delivering promised savings. The reversal reflects that the initial cuts went "too far, too fast."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has averted all planned layoffs of over 1,600 city workers, initially proposed to address a $1 billion budget shortfall. This achievement follows months of negotiations and cost-cutting measures, including agreements with city unions for unpaid holidays and scaling back hiring in the LAPD and LAFD. Some workers had already been laid off but will now be reinstated, with others moved to open positions. While celebrating this fiscal year's success, officials caution that budget challenges persist, requiring continued focus on long-term solutions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle strengthened to a Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center forecasts Gabrielle to move northeast, approaching the Azores by Thursday, and generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the US East Coast and Bermuda. Despite initial predictions for a busier-than-usual season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated. Only one of the previous six named storms made US landfall, and officials continue to monitor Gabrielle's powerful trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a player challenge system for called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, following years of testing. The system, powered by an automated strike zone (ABS), allows batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge calls immediately, with a video replay displayed on the scoreboard. Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system balances the umpire's role with correcting missed calls and preserving game pace, a change largely welcomed by players.</p>

          <p>YouTube announced a reversal of its policy, allowing creators previously banned for Covid-19 or election-related misinformation to apply for reinstatement. This change, described as a limited pilot project, follows mounting Republican pressure on tech companies to revise Biden-era speech policies. Alphabet's lawyer, Daniel Donovan, stated that YouTube's Community Guidelines now permit a wider range of content on these topics and that pressure from the Biden administration to remove certain videos was "unacceptable." YouTube emphasized its commitment to "free expression" and will not empower third-party fact-checkers for moderation.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a major shift in his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." This declaration, made after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, cited Russia's economic troubles as a key factor. Trump previously suggested Ukraine might need to cede territory, an idea Zelenskyy consistently rejected. Trump also advocated for NATO nations to shoot down Russian aircraft violating their airspace. Zelenskyy hailed the "big shift," though specific details on US security guarantees remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the US by volume, two years after its parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw Bud Light lose the top spot following a consumer boycott. The success marks a turnaround for Anheuser-Busch, which faced a difficult 2023. Constellation, Modelo's owner, cited a "challenging macroeconomic environment" and stricter US immigration policies impacting Hispanic consumers for its declining sales. Michelob Ultra's growth is attributed to the launch of its non-alcoholic version and increased marketing efforts, amid a broader trend of declining beer consumption in the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has stunned tech companies and skilled foreign workers, prompting calls for Canada to capitalize on the opportunity. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney acknowledged the potential to retain more homegrown talent and attract those deterred by US policy changes. While Canada's immigration system is seen as a viable alternative, some experts caution about its own challenges, including scaled-back immigration and lower average wages compared to the US. The article indicates this move creates a window for Canada to attract highly skilled professionals, as evidenced by past H-1B holders relocating north.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent dramatic shift on Ukraine, now suggesting Kyiv can reclaim all its land, is part of a broader pattern of emboldened and controversial behavior. This analysis links his Ukraine U-turn to other recent statements, including expressing hatred for opponents, making unscientific claims about Tylenol and autism, and deriding the UN. The article suggests Trump thrives on controversy and is feeling less constrained, using his combative style to energize his base. While his approach causes "political earthquakes," it risks deepening polarization, just nine months into his four-year term.</p>

          <p>Car buyers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) before federal tax credits of up to $7,500 expire on September 30, due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Dealerships are offering additional incentives to clear inventory, resulting in significant savings for consumers. While September is expected to be a record month, experts anticipate a potential sales slowdown post-expiration, as automakers have already begun to adjust production.</p>

          <p>Amid President Trump's controversial claims linking Tylenol (acetaminophen) to autism, medical experts are advising parents on the drug's safety. While Trump emphatically warned against its use during pregnancy and childhood, major physician groups and Tylenol's manufacturer refute a direct causal link, citing decades of research. This article explains that studies on the association are mixed, with some finding correlations but others, particularly sibling-comparison studies, showing no causal effect. Experts stress that untreated fever and pain in pregnancy pose significant risks, and acetaminophen remains one of the safest over-the-counter options, urging parents to trust medical providers over unsubstantiated claims.</p>
