          <p>Shakira, Jason Aldean, and Brooks & Dunn had their concerts at Boston's Fenway Park abruptly canceled due to stage safety concerns discovered during a routine pre-show check, revealing structural elements that were not up to standard, according to Live Nation. Fenway Park also confirmed the cancellations, offering refunds to ticket holders and apologizing for the inconvenience. Sources indicate that the staging fell apart during rehearsal, leading to an inspection by Boston Inspectorial Services, which deemed the staging structurally unsound. While Aldean and Brooks & Dunn acknowledged the cancellation on social media, Shakira has yet to comment publicly. The cancellation disappointed many fans, some of whom had traveled from out of state to attend the concerts.</p>

McAllen, Texas, ranks as the top overall city due to stable housing prices and moderate home prices relative to local income. Midwestern metro areas like Peoria and Decatur, Illinois, lead in affordability, while Cape Coral and Port St. Lucie, Florida, offer the most robust housing inventory per capita.

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused China of violating a recent trade agreement with the United States, raising concerns about a potential resurgence of trade tensions. Trump's criticism follows pessimistic comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding U.S.-China trade talks. A previous trade agreement had reduced tariffs between the two countries, boosting the stock market and easing recession fears. However, a recent court ruling invalidated the legal basis for some tariffs, adding uncertainty to the trade policy landscape (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former Sinn Féin leader, has been awarded €100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a story that alleged he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson. Adams has consistently denied any involvement in Donaldson's death. The BBC defended its reporting as fair and reasonable on a matter of public interest, but the court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith. The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder, expressing frustration with the legal proceedings.</p>

The director stated that the Israeli forces threatened to bomb the hospital if it was not evacuated, leading to the relocation of patients to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that there is no remaining functioning hospital in the North Gaza governorate, severing a critical lifeline for the people there. The IDF stated it was operating in the area against terror targets, but was not aware of any siege on the hospital itself.</p>

          <p>Costco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, with sales increasing by 8% year-over-year; however, shares fell slightly. Despite not providing an annual outlook, Costco leaders noted that tariffs have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments, prompting some price increases. The company's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, compared to $1.68 billion, or $3.78 per share, in the previous year. Costco's competitive prices and bulk discounts may benefit from tariff-related economic concerns (not investment advice).</p>
