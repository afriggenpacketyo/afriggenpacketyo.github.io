          <p>Premier Li Qiang has called on Chinese officials to enhance their ability to anticipate challenges and implement policies effectively amidst a complex and severe global environment. Li emphasized the importance of promoting China's modernization with high-quality development during a ceremony for newly appointed government officials. His comments come as China navigates rising tensions with the West over trade and technology, including ongoing negotiations with the United States regarding tariffs and export controls, and preparations for a trade summit with the European Union. Recent talks between American and Chinese officials in London resulted in a framework to de-escalate disputes over rare earths and strategic technologies, though the U.S. plans to maintain tariffs on Chinese goods. The stability of this relationship will be tested as these issues progress.</p>

          <p>China has entered the race to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, which an industry expert says will position the country for significant advancements in artificial intelligence, 6G technology, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) announced the production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, utilizing light instead of electrical signals for information processing. While Europe and the U.S. have already established themselves in the field, China's pilot production line is showing gains in technical performance. TFLN is known for its ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption, potentially overcoming global limits for high-speed optical links, marking a significant advancement for China in the competitive tech landscape.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are engaged in a behind-the-scenes race to fill the ranking member position on the House Oversight Committee following the death of Representative Gerry Connolly. Four Democratsâ€”Stephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfumeâ€”are vying for the role, which offers a significant platform and potential to become chair if the party regains the majority. As Democrats weigh their options, they are considering factors such as public communication skills, ability to support lawmakers in battleground districts, and strategies to challenge President Trump. The vote for the Oversight ranking member is scheduled for June 24, with candidates addressing various caucuses this week, and the outcome is expected to be closely contested.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan aims to achieve progress in ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States but will not compromise national interests for a quick agreement. Ishiba's remarks preceded a potential meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Canada. Japan's chief tariff negotiator is expected to hold further talks with the United States, as Japan urges the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy and pursue a mutually beneficial deal. Increased Japanese investment, Ishiba argues, will help create jobs in the United States, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a possible extension of the current pause on tariffs if negotiations proceed constructively.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are currently in an Algarve training camp, preparing for their upcoming tour of Australia. Despite a relaxed atmosphere, the team faces the challenge of building cohesion quickly before their match against Argentina in Dublin on June 20. Fifteen players from Leinster, Bath, and Leicester are absent due to domestic finals, meaning head coach Andy Farrell has yet to have his full touring party together. Assistant coach John Dalziel emphasizes the need for adaptability, citing the demanding schedule and potential for injuries, and the team has already had to reshuffle due to Zander Fagerson's injury, while Bealham and the Opoku-Fordjour brothers have joined to bolster training numbers.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation revealed that ticket touts made millions by exploiting loopholes and allegedly receiving assistance from staff at major ticketing firms. Prolific touts like Peter Hunter and Maria Chenery-Woods fraudulently traded tickets, using resale sites like StubHub, Viagogo, and Ticketmaster-owned platforms. Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites admitted to working closely with touts, while court documents revealed that some staff even bought tickets for touts. Email evidence suggested that one tout was offered a meeting with a top Ticketmaster lawyer to brainstorm ways the company could assist them, raising questions about the extent of collusion within the industry.</p>

This decision follows the resumption of daily loudspeaker broadcasts last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons. South Korea hopes that this proactive step will reduce military tensions and alleviate concerns for residents in border areas, who have been affected by North Korea's retaliatory broadcasts, and while North Korea has not commented, South Korea's military reported no North Korean broadcasts in frontline areas on Thursday morning.</p>

Lady Brittan expressed that her trust in the Met and the police watchdog has been severely undermined, and she described the raid on her home shortly after her husband's death as insensitive.

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center against the backdrop of protests in Los Angeles. The musical, which tells the story of revolution against authoritarianism, created a moment of irony as Trump has sent troops to quell immigration protests. Trump's appearance, intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, was met with a mix of cheers and boos, and his attendance followed his seizure of control of the center in February, and the event was described as a surreal combination of theater and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, revealing a dark legacy from the U.S. military occupation after World War II. The Mace B cruise missile site, constructed in the 1960s, is the last remaining of four such sites, and it was restored by Soka Gakkai to educate the public about Okinawa's history with nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, the U.S. deployed nuclear weapons on Okinawa, despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan following the Fukuryu Maru No. 5 incident. The missiles, with a range of over 2,000 kilometers, could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union, but they were removed starting in 1969 as Okinawa returned to Japan without nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Despite promises to break the cycle of political revenge, newly elected South Korean President Lee Jae-myung has approved investigations into his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, and his wife. Each of the previous six South Korean presidents has faced criminal investigations during or after leaving office. Lee, who previously vowed to end this pattern, is now facing criticism for potentially continuing the cycle, and he has signed bills mandating special counsel investigations into Yoon's declaration of martial law and his wife's alleged corruption.

Non-essential embassy staff and their dependents are being removed, and officials have indicated that Israel may be ready to launch an operation into Iran.
