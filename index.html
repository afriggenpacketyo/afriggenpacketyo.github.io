          <p>The UK jobs market weakened in the first quarter of 2025, with payroll numbers declining, according to the Office for National Statistics. Job vacancies also decreased, indicating a cooling demand for labor. Wage growth experienced a slowdown, but regular earnings continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation, providing some relief for workers facing increased living costs. This mixed data suggests a complex economic environment where employment opportunities are becoming more limited while wages still manage to outpace inflation, reflecting ongoing adjustments in the UK economy.</p>

          <p>Addiction experts are warning that proposed cuts to addiction funding by Congress could lead to a rise in overdose deaths. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers was delivered to Congress, highlighting concerns over drastic cuts to key agencies. While fatal overdoses decreased in 2024 due to sustained financial investment, experts fear that reducing these investments will reverse progress. Recovery programs in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods may be particularly affected, and research efforts tracking new synthetic street drugs could be defunded.</p>

Experts suggest that China's technological progress may not be sufficient to overcome these structural economic issues, as advanced manufacturing constitutes a smaller portion of China's output compared to real estate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the US-China trade talks, tariff rates have been significantly reduced, but a complex web of duties remains. The headline changes include lowered tariffs for the next 90 days, with Chinese goods facing at least 30% in tariffs and American exports a minimum of 10%. However, these rates do not account for previous tariffs from the initial trade war or other duties on specific goods. The new effective tariff rate is estimated to be around 50%, combining the existing tariffs and the new duties, impacting Chinese manufacturers and exporters.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, which initially struggled with interest rate hikes in 2022, saw increased profits as higher rates boosted net interest income. Now, these fintechs, especially digital banks, face a key test as declining interest rates raise questions about the sustainability of their business models. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on card fees and interest, offering services like crypto and share trading. The industry's resilience will depend on its ability to adapt and monetize its customer base through non-interest services.</p>
