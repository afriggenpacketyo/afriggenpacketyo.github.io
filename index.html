          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court is set to deliver its verdict regarding the prison term of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who returned to Bangkok after a period of exile. Thaksin, a prominent figure in Thai politics, faces scrutiny over whether he properly served his sentence, which was initially commuted by the king and later saw him released on parole. The court's decision comes amid ongoing political tensions and concerns about the influence of the Shinawatra family, whose popularity has waned with the rise of other political movements. Supporters of Thaksin gathered outside the Supreme Court, awaiting the ruling amidst tight security measures. The verdict will have implications for Thai politics and the legacy of the Shinawatra dynasty. </p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson expressed opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," citing a lack of prior notice and concerns about potential human rights abuses. The DHS stated the operation targets criminal illegal aliens drawn to Chicago due to sanctuary policies. Governor Pritzker accused the Trump administration of failing to coordinate with state and local leaders. Johnson urged residents concerned about the crackdown to access resources on the city's website. The announcement followed a controversial social media post by President Trump referencing deportations in Chicago. </p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch voiced concerns that the UK might need an IMF bailout similar to the 1976 crisis, urging collaboration with Labour to cut welfare spending and stimulate economic growth. She cited rising borrowing costs and a lack of economic growth as indicators, while a Labour Party source criticized her remarks as hypocritical given the Conservative government's past economic policies. Badenoch offered an "olive branch" to Prime Minister Starmer to work together on economic solutions, emphasizing the need for a growth plan to avoid a crisis. The article discusses the potential economic challenges facing the UK and the political debate surrounding solutions. </p>

          <p>US lawmakers have released Jeffrey Epstein's "birthday book," which contains a note allegedly signed by Donald Trump, alongside other documents like Epstein's will and address book. The White House has denied the authenticity of the alleged Trump letter, which features a drawing of a woman's body. The book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, includes messages from various high-profile figures connected to Epstein, including former President Bill Clinton and Lord Peter Mandelson. The release comes amid growing pressure for transparency on investigations into Epstein's activities. </p>

          <p>The murder of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on the Charlotte Metro has prompted a federal investigation led by the FBI and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, indicating national implications. Patel hinted at new developments in the case, while Duffy announced an investigation into the Charlotte transit system's security failures. President Trump has weighed in on the incident, demanding accountability and suggesting federal transportation funding could be at risk for cities failing to curb violence on public transit. The administration views the case as a national test of accountability and is considering using federal funds as leverage. </p>

          <p>President Trump's social media post referencing "Apocalypse Now" and mass deportations in Chicago has drawn concern and outrage, with critics calling it a threat of military action against an American city. The post, featuring an AI-generated image of Trump, was denounced by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Senator Dick Durbin. Trump defended the post as a joke and stated his intention to "clean up" cities, targeting those under Democratic control. The Department of Homeland Security announced a surge of immigration law enforcement in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." </p>

          <p>Max Muncy has been activated from the injured list and returned to the Dodgers' lineup, aiming to boost the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who was hitting .258 with 17 home runs, missed 23 games due to an oblique injury. The Dodgers had a losing record during Muncy's absence and hope his presence will provide a spark. Other players, including Alex Vesia and Tommy Edman, are also expected to return soon. </p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is constructing a transit center to handle seaborne imports of durians, complementing a new "durian express" shipping service. The service aims to reduce shipment times to as little as six days, handling approximately 10,000 TEUs of durians annually. Northeastern China's population of roughly 100 million wants more durians, but shipments from major sources such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam take a relatively long time to reach Dalian, threatening the freshness of deliveries. This initiative seeks to improve logistics and freshness for durian deliveries to the region. </p>

          <p>The Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest has burned through part of the McKinley grove of giant sequoias, setting some of the trees on fire. Firefighters are working to protect the trees by setting up sprinkler lines and wrapping trunks with fire-resistant material. The fire has been difficult to contain due to steep terrain, dead trees, and a lack of recent fires in the area. An estimated 20% of the world’s mature giant sequoias have died in the last decade due to severe wildfires. </p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a bill that would ban online pet dealer websites and brokers from selling dogs to consumers, aiming to curtail the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills. The bill seeks to prevent buyers from being misled about the origin of their puppies and ensure transparency in pet sales. It builds on a 2019 law that banned pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs, addressing the growing online pet sales market. The bill now heads to Governor Newsom for consideration. </p>

          <p>Despite a ban on disposable vapes, millions are still being thrown away incorrectly, causing chaos for the waste industry, according to a waste firm boss. He said cheap reusable devices have been launched, and people are binning them instead of refilling and recycling them. A vape industry spokesperson claims the ban has been successful, and any rise in devices being thrown away is likely due to black market trade. Vapes contain lithium batteries, which can cause fires when crushed, costing the UK waste industry a billion pounds a year. </p>
