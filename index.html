          <p>Luxembourg is preparing for a change in leadership as Grand Duke Henri, 70, will abdicate after a 25-year reign, with his son, Crown Prince Guillaume, 43, set to take the throne. The transition, which began in 2024, will be formalized in a ceremony attended by European royalty and political leaders. While the head of state role is largely representative, the new Grand Duke is expected to bring a warmer touch to the position, though no major policy shifts are anticipated.</p>

Portraying himself as an anti-establishment outsider, Babis pledges to run the country like a company, despite his long history within the nation's elite. His political career has been marked by numerous controversies, including allegations of EU subsidy fraud, conflicts of interest, and collaboration with the communist-era secret service, all of which he dismisses as attacks from "the system."</p>

The report notes that despite economic growth, the demographic challenge of an aging population and outward migration from the east makes closing the gap with the west increasingly difficult.

          <p>Recent satellite images show that China has constructed additional replicas of key Taiwanese government buildings at its Zhurihe military training base in Inner Mongolia. The expanded training area now includes mock-ups of Taiwan's foreign and defense ministries, in addition to the previously identified presidential office building. According to a Japanese think tank, this development suggests the People's Liberation Army is conducting more systematic and combat-oriented training for a potential conflict, including drills simulating an assault on the capital.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams were left "sick" after a 26-23 overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers, with players and the coach taking individual blame for critical errors. Running back Kyren Williams lamented a costly fumble near the goal line, while coach Sean McVay faulted his own play call on the final fourth-down attempt that ended the game. The loss was a missed opportunity for the Rams to take first place in the NFC West and was particularly painful given it was against an injury-depleted 49ers team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a move that follows standard regulatory procedure but has drawn immediate criticism from anti-abortion groups and Republican politicians. Opponents called the decision "a stain on the Trump presidency," increasing pressure on the administration's health officials who have already pledged a new safety review of the long-approved drug. The FDA maintains it has very limited discretion in approving generic drugs that are proven to be identical to their brand-name counterparts.</p>

The defeat comes as Milei's popularity wanes amid public discontent over his severe austerity measures, which have curbed inflation but deeply impacted social services. (not investment advice)</p>

Legal experts suggest that banning such apps could be difficult, as they may be protected under the First Amendment, similar to police radio scanners.</p>

The report found that 42% of working-age Americans have no spare savings after covering basic living expenses, a significant increase from 31% in 1997. This financial pressure is driven by the rising costs of essentials like housing and healthcare, making the traditional advice to simply "save more" unrealistic for millions and widening the nation's retirement savings gap.
