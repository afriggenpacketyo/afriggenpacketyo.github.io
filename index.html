          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville and Minneapolis, ending investigations initiated during the Biden administration. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that consent decrees sought by the Biden administration would have led to excessive federal oversight of local departments. These investigations followed the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, but the Trump administration claims the consent decrees were factually unjustified. The Justice Department is also closing investigations into several other police departments, retracting findings of unconstitutional violations. </p>

          <p>The New York Times article examines text messages between Russian deep-cover operatives, Artem Shmyrev and his wife Irina, revealing the difficulties and frustrations of their assignments in Brazil and Greece. The messages, recovered from Shmyrev's phone, highlight the emotional toll of living under false identities and being separated for extended periods. The exchanges reveal feelings of loneliness, disillusionment with the realities of espionage, and the challenges of maintaining a long-distance marriage while working for Russia’s foreign intelligence service. The article suggests that deep-cover work is not as glamorous as recruits might expect. </p>

The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5 percent, reflecting these worries, with the 30-year yield exceeding 5 percent. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that volatility in the Treasury market could further destabilize the economic outlook. The administration's tax bill is expected to increase the federal debt, potentially leading to higher interest rates demanded by investors. </p>

Higher energy and water bills, along with increases in food and service costs, contributed to the surge. Economists predict inflation could inch up further before falling back to 3% next year, potentially limiting the Bank of England's ability to cut interest rates. However, factors such as US President Trump's trade war and a recent deal with the EU could help bring inflation down. </p>

          <p>A South Carolina death row inmate, James Robertson, is seeking to represent himself, potentially leading to his execution, after several of his friends were executed.

The company now expects a low-single-digit decline in sales for the fiscal year. Target also announced leadership changes and a new office aimed at improving results. </p>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli troops could effectively take control of all of Gaza as part of the offensive. Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare public reprimand of Israel, demanding that it cease its widening military offensive in Gaza. The past few days have been especially deadly for Palestinians in Gaza, with Israeli strikes having killed more than 400 people since last Thursday. </p>

The Trump administration scrapped rules prohibiting the sale of high-end chips to these countries, leading to criticism that this could benefit China in the global AI race. Experts note that the alternative would be to exclude strategic allies from the AI ecosystem, potentially driving them into China's arms.

          <p>A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, highlighting the advantages of telework.

Companies that ignore these findings risk talent attrition and reduced agility. The GAO study reveals that offering remote days can significantly reduce turnover and that employees value autonomy and work-life balance. </p>

Callable CDs offer higher interest rates than traditional CDs but allow the bank to redeem them before the full term.
