          <p>This article details former U.S. President Donald Trump's reported efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize, including a surprising call to Norway's finance minister to inquire about his nomination. Despite his public desire for the award, his economic policies are drawing significant criticism from Nobel Laureate economists, who are meeting for their annual event in Lindau, Germany. Joseph Stiglitz, for instance, expressed concerns about the U.S. becoming a "scary place to invest" due to tariff policies risking stagflation. Other laureates, Roger Myerson and Simon Johnson, voiced worries about American politics and isolationism, respectively, presenting a tough economic reality that contrasts sharply with Trump's peace prize ambitions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines why numerous major brands, including American Eagle and Swatch, are increasingly facing public backlash for their marketing campaigns and product launches. Experts suggest these blunders stem from an outdated approach to cultural complexity, indicating "empathy failures" rather than mere "sensitivity failures" in understanding modern consumers. Companies are struggling to genuinely connect with diverse consumer bases in an era of heightened scrutiny and social media, with some even taking calculated risks for attention, leading to disproportionate publicity that could convert into sales. This dynamic highlights the fine balance brands must tread to stand out and maintain relevance without causing widespread offense in an increasingly sensitive market.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to establish a new independent body with adjudicators to expedite case hearings and cut costs. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated this initiative is a practical step to end "unacceptable delays" in the current system, which sees 51,000 cases awaiting decision and many asylum seekers housed in taxpayer-funded hotels. The move comes amid increasing public pressure and protests over the policy, with ministers committed to closing all asylum hotels in a managed way. This article highlights the government's response to ongoing challenges in the immigration system and recent legal setbacks.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has strongly criticized reports of the Trump administration planning to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime. Pritzker asserts there is no emergency warranting federal intervention and accuses President Trump of "attempting to manufacture a crisis" to politicize the military and distract from his policies impacting working families. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also expressed concerns, stating such a deployment would be "uncoordinated, uncalled-for and unsound" and could inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement.

          <p>This article reports that Virginia Giuffre's family is "outraged" by the U.S. Department of Justice's release of an interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, claiming it provided her a "platform to rewrite history." Maxwell, who is serving a prison sentence for luring young girls for Jeffrey Epstein to abuse, refuted several child sexual assault claims, including those against Prince Andrew and denying inappropriate settings with Donald Trump. The family argues Maxwell was "never challenged" on her "court-proven lies," and her recent move to a minimum-security facility sends a disturbing message, invalidating survivors' experiences.</p>

          <p>This article reports on a call from disability charity Disabled Motoring UK for all UK airports to waive drop-off fees for blue badge holders. The charity argues that the current system is inconsistent and complex, with many airports still charging disabled passengers for close-to-terminal drop-offs, sometimes as high as £7. While some airports offer discounts or exemptions, others require complex online registration or charge full fees, causing frustration and inconvenience. This article highlights the need for standardized, respectful treatment of disabled customers and greater accessibility at airports across the country.</p>

          <p>This article explores the controversy surrounding three alleged Kazimir Malevich paintings, valued at over £100 million, reportedly discovered under an Israeli pensioner's bed and now exhibited in Bucharest.

He notes the lack of documentation during the artist's life and questions the reliability of the authenticating art historian, who has previously authenticated disputed works.
