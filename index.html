          <p>A Brown University sophomore, Alex Shieh, is facing disciplinary action after emailing non-faculty employees to inquire about their roles and responsibilities, mirroring Elon Muskâ€™s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) style. Representative Troy Nehls has intervened, urging the university to reconsider any disciplinary action, arguing it infringes on free expression and open inquiry. The university claims the issue is not about free speech but about potential misuse of non-public data and violation of IT policies. Tuition at Brown University is approximately $96,000 per year, and Nehls is seeking more information on how Brown uses its $7.2 billion endowment to improve the student experience or lower tuition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing the university's refusal to comply with demands related to antisemitism and DEI policies. A Harvard spokesperson argues there is no legal basis for such action and that it would harm the university's educational mission by reducing financial aid and hindering medical research. The Trump administration has already frozen over $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, prompting a lawsuit from the university alleging First Amendment violations. Federal law restricts the president from directly ordering the IRS to conduct investigations, but sources indicate the IRS was considering the revocation before Trump's public statements.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed Americans to purchase goods from China worth up to $800 without paying tariffs. This move aims to support U.S. manufacturers struggling to compete with low-cost Chinese products, but it is expected to increase prices for American consumers shopping online. The administration also cited concerns about the loophole being exploited for fentanyl trafficking, as it allowed less scrutiny of shipping details. Retailers like Temu and Shein have already begun indicating that tariffs are included in their prices, and analysts predict a price shock for U.S. consumers who benefited from cheap goods. </p>

          <p>Mumbai, India's entertainment hub, is facing increasing scrutiny over free speech as artists and entertainers are targeted by censors and opponents. Comedian Kunal Kamra faced a mob attack and venue closure after satirizing a politician, while a film release was delayed due to objections from Brahmin groups. Writer and political analyst Raju Parulekar argues that these attacks have become state-sponsored since the ruling BJP came to power in 2014. Lawyer Anamika Jha provides legal services to independent creators, noting that content about political or religious themes puts them at greater legal risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are poised to disrupt holiday sales and deplete retail inventories, impacting events like Amazon Prime Day, July 4th sales, and Black Friday. Many small businesses that supply big box retail stores are reviewing their product inventories and discount plans based on the new tariff economics. Companies like YouCopia have already temporarily shuttered factories in China due to the increased costs, potentially leading to bare shelves by August. Retailers are attempting to mitigate the tariff impact by raising prices and asking retailers to share the burden, while consumers may see fewer promotions and higher prices. </p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating a former fish market in Barcelona have discovered the wreck of a ship that may have sunk around 500 years ago. The ruined stern of a large vessel, possibly from the 15th or 16th centuries, was found in good condition. The fragment, measuring 10 meters long and 3 meters wide, is believed to be of Mediterranean-style construction with Atlantic influences. The timbers of the vessel have been preserved by damp sand, requiring constant watering to prevent drying out.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal bid to reinstate automatic, taxpayer-funded police protection during visits to the United Kingdom. A judge ruled that Harry's security situation will remain as is, with state-funded police protection provided on a case-by-case basis. The ruling marks the end of a multiyear legal challenge stemming from a 2020 decision that denied his family automatic security after he and his wife stepped away from their roles as senior working royals. Harry's lawyers argued that he faces security risks, including threats from al-Qaeda.</p>
