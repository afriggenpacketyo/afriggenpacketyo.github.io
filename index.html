          <h2>Tesla Reports Sales Miss and Declining Automotive Revenue for Second Straight Quarter</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 16% year-over-year decline in its second-quarter automotive revenue, marking the second consecutive quarter of falling sales that missed analyst estimates. The company's performance is partly attributed to increased competition from other automakers, particularly affordable Chinese EVs, and a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities. While Musk is focusing investors on future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots, the company's stock has underperformed this year, and it has only recently started building a more affordable vehicle model.

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has rejected a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury records from the 2005 and 2007 investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. The judge cited strict precedent in the Eleventh Circuit that limits the disclosure of such materials, stating her "hands are tied" and that the government's arguments did not meet the high bar for an exception. This decision is a setback for the Trump administration, which has been seeking the release of records from multiple Epstein-related cases amid public and political pressure for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, driven by strong growth in its software and infrastructure segments. The company's revenue increased by nearly 8% year-over-year, with its hybrid cloud division showing 16% growth. Despite the positive results, IBM's shares experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. The technology firm maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating over $13.5 billion in free cash flow and revenue growth of at least 5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill has reduced its same-store sales growth forecast for the year to be flat, a significant downgrade from its previous projection of a low-single-digit increase. This revision came after the company experienced a second consecutive quarter of declining customer traffic, with same-store sales shrinking by 4%. Executives attribute the downturn to a broader consumer pullback, as economic concerns lead diners to reduce their restaurant spending. The news caused Chipotle's stock to fall sharply in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of recent drowning fatalities, including that of "The Cosby Show" actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner and a former police officer, are raising awareness about the dangers of rip currents. Experts emphasize that these powerful channels of water are a leading cause of beach rescues and can be deadly even for strong swimmers. The United States Lifesaving Association advises against attempting rescues without a flotation device and recommends that anyone caught in a rip current should stay calm, float, and swim parallel to the shore. This year, 36 deaths have already been attributed to rip currents.</p>

This approach, often referred to as a carbohydrate revolution, is critical for performance, allowing cyclists to maintain energy levels and recover effectively between stages.

Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds provide a yield, making them an attractive option for large investors to manage cash.

Ekitike is noted for his versatility, tactical understanding, and all-around game, though his conversion rate in front of goal has been cited as an area for improvement.

          <p>The opening day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford was an evenly fought contest, ending with India at 264-4. The day was marked by a significant injury to India's wicketkeeper, Rishabh Pant, who retired hurt on 37 after being struck on the foot. Before his injury, Pant and debutant Sai Sudharsan (61) had built a crucial partnership. England captain Ben Stokes was a key performer, taking two important wickets after once again choosing to field first on a pitch that offered assistance to the bowlers throughout the day.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Michael Vaughan has praised veteran spinner Liam Dawson, stating that his inclusion makes the national team stronger. Playing in his first Test match in eight years, the 35-year-old left-armer made an immediate impact against India, dismissing opener Yashasvi Jaiswal early and providing crucial control for England's bowling attack. Dawson, who has a stellar domestic record, was recalled to the side due to an injury to Shoaib Bashir. Vaughan argued that Dawson's all-around package of control, batting ability, and fielding is exactly what the current England side needs.</p>

He argued that the political center has become too passive, allowing a vocal minority on the far left to gain outsized influence, and must articulate a clear, affirmative agenda, especially on affordability. Torres, who grew up in public housing, emphasized the need for pragmatic, results-oriented governance over ideological sloganeering. He also discussed how foreign policy, particularly regarding Israel, has become a significant and sometimes strange flashpoint in local and national Democratic politics.</p>

The demonstrations, which have seen over 1,000 attendees, have resulted in 10 arrests after eight police officers and two hotel staff members were injured.

The announcement provided a political lifeline for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who faced pressure to resign after recent election losses.

He openly discussed his past crack addiction and directed sharp criticism at media figures and factions within the Democratic Party, while staunchly defending his father. This article argues that while his refusal to accept accountability for his actions is a clear character trait, his raw and unfiltered communication style may be what is required to connect with certain voter demographics in the current media landscape.</p>
