          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 12:52:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is poised to announce a connection between prenatal Tylenol use and an increased risk of autism, while simultaneously advocating for the drug leucovorin as a treatment for certain autism symptoms. This forthcoming announcement has drawn significant pushback from Tylenol manufacturer Kenvue and a broad consensus of medical experts. They firmly assert that robust, independent scientific studies clearly demonstrate no causal link between acetaminophen, Tylenol's active ingredient, and autism. Experts underscore that Tylenol remains the safest pain relief option for pregnant women, and discouraging its use could compel them towards potentially more dangerous alternatives for managing conditions like high fever, which itself can be detrimental to fetal neurodevelopment.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as patron from six charities, including Julia's House and the Teenage Cancer Trust, following the emergence of a 2011 email. In the email, she reportedly referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend" and appeared to apologize for publicly criticizing him. Her spokesperson stated the email was sent to assuage Epstein's threats of defamation, asserting her regret for any association. This development rekindles scrutiny over her past ties, echoing the controversies faced by her ex-husband Prince Andrew regarding his own connections to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019.</p>

          <p>Nvidia plans a substantial $100 billion investment in OpenAI, facilitating the AI lab's ambitious goal to construct data centers demanding 10 gigawatts of power, which translates to an estimated 4 to 5 million graphics processing units. This significant partnership highlights the integral relationship between these two leaders driving the current AI boom, with OpenAI depending heavily on Nvidia's advanced chips for its software development and deployment to 700 million active weekly users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stressed the critical nature of this infrastructure challenge for future AI advancements. Nvidia is designated as a preferred supplier for chips and networking gear, with the initial phase of this massive buildout slated for the latter half of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey asserts his party bears a moral responsibility to thwart Nigel Farage and his Reform UK party from gaining political influence. During the party's autumn conference, Sir Ed presented the Liberal Democrats as a viable alternative to the established Labour and Conservative parties, advocating for "radical change" aligned with traditional British values, in stark opposition to what he described as Farage's desire for a UK resembling "Trump's America." Despite acknowledging the party's current poll standings, he underscored their growing "momentum," suggesting that addressing key voter anxieties, such as illegal immigration and the cost of living, with the Liberal Democrats' proposed policies could sway Reform supporters.</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled the structural details of a proposed deal aimed at preserving TikTok for its 170 million U.S. users, asserting that Beijing has approved the framework. The plan involves transitioning TikTok's U.S. operations into a new, American-based joint venture, featuring a majority of U.S. investors and board members. Oracle is slated to act as the comprehensive security provider for these operations, including configuring content recommendations and bringing the app's powerful algorithm under the control of the U.S. entity. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week, affirming the deal meets national security interests and extending the enforcement pause on the ban for an additional 120 days to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>Google is now engaged in a second federal court battle against the U.S. Justice Department, which aims to dismantle its internet empire, this time targeting its digital advertising practices. The trial in Virginia focuses on the "remedy" after U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema already declared parts of Google's ad technology an illegal monopoly, harming online publishers. The Justice Department seeks a breakup, proposing Google sell parts of its ad tech business, while Google argues this would cause disruption and claims its recent changes suffice. This follows a search engine monopoly case where the outcome was less severe than the DOJ sought, prompting the judge to consider that precedent.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is set to furlough around 1,800 flight attendants, constituting approximately one-third of its cabin crew, as part of an aggressive cost-reduction strategy during its second bankruptcy filing within a year.

The airline will initially offer voluntary furloughs, but due to the exhaustion of voluntary leave options, involuntary furloughs are anticipated.

The attack, which occurred during early Friday prayers, also claimed at least 70 lives and damaged nearby homes. Local aid groups and the Sudanese army have attributed the strike to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell denounced the incident as "shocking and unconscionable," drawing attention to the severe plight of children trapped in the besieged city, enduring violence, and lacking access to food, clean water, and healthcare amidst the escalating civil war.</p>

          <p>Median household incomes experienced a decline in seven of the 50 largest U.S. cities between 2023 and 2024, contrasting with a modest national increase of just over 1%. Minneapolis recorded the most significant decrease, exceeding 4%, with incomes for households with children dropping by over 19%. An analysis by SmartAsset suggests these trends might indicate families facing challenges with wage growth or be influenced by demographic shifts, such as increased divorces or parents opting out of the workforce. Even in cities like Denver and Seattle, which saw declines, their median incomes remain comfortably above the national average, underscoring localized economic fluctuations.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate reduction, the first such cut in nearly a year, has notably influenced the mortgage market, pushing 30-year fixed rates down to an average of 6.13%, their lowest in almost three years. This shift offers considerable relief for borrowers, especially those with large loans. For instance, a $1 million 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now carries a principal and interest payment of $6,079.34 per month, representing a saving of over $600 compared to the 7.04% rates seen in January. Over the entire loan term, these savings could exceed $200,000 in total interest, making both new purchases and refinancing opportunities more appealing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced its acquisition of weight loss drug developer Metsera in a deal valued at up to $7.3 billion, including contingent future payments. This strategic move is designed to significantly enhance Pfizer's competitive position in the rapidly expanding obesity drug market, projected to reach $100 billion by the 2030s, especially after previous internal drug development challenges. Metsera contributes a robust pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments, notably a GLP-1 drug, MET-233i, which demonstrated substantial weight loss in early-stage trials and is being developed as a potential once-monthly injectable. This acquisition is anticipated to fast-track Pfizer's entry into a market currently led by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. (not investment advice)</p>

This simultaneous introduction of a new, fully homegrown carrier design and at least two novel naval aircraft designs is a significant feat.

          <p>On September 22, 2025, the price of gold is $3,728.61 per ounce, a figure that constantly fluctuates due to various market dynamics. Historically, gold serves as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, particularly appealing during periods of economic or market instability. Its value is significantly influenced by fundamental economic principles like supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate policies. Geopolitical uncertainties also drive investors towards gold, while currency movements, such as a weakening U.S. dollar, can make it more appealing to international buyers. Central bank actions and overall market sentiment further contribute to its price determination. (not investment advice)</p>
