          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm made a deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The departures follow an executive order from Trump that criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who investigated Trump, and for taking on a pro bono case related to the January 6 Capitol riot. The order was later rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, including auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on mutually agreed causes. The deal and subsequent departures have sparked controversy in the legal community.</p>

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a 22-year-old inmate, was captured after escaping from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail for the second time in a year. Johnson, awaiting trial for a home invasion case, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, and he was lifted over the perimeter fence by another inmate. Sheriff Gerald Sticker said at least four individuals were placed on administrative leave pending a full review. Johnson had previously escaped in May 2024 and was found hiding in a dumpster. Manpower shortages and inadequate staff training contributed to the prior escape.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting the resource-rich Jiangxi province to the wealthy coastal Zhejiang province. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, part of a larger project to connect Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water, is expected to cost $44.4 billion, making it the most expensive artificial canal in China. The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. Planned as a Class III waterway, it will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dramatically curtailed press access inside the Pentagon, citing recent leaks of classified and unclassified information. The new restrictions limit reporters to one corner on one floor of the building, requiring escorts for access to other areas, including those near the joint chiefs and press offices. The Pentagon Press Association condemned the measures as an attack on the freedom of the press, questioning the effectiveness of the restrictions in preventing leaks. Hegseth has taken an adversarial stance toward the media, including ejecting several news organizations from their workspaces.</p>

The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, doubling last year's level due to a poor harvest and increased demand.</p>

          <p>Stock markets declined following President Trump's threats to impose new tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all experienced losses. Trump's threats included a 25% tariff on Apple if the company did not shift iPhone production to the U.S. and a 50% tariff on the European Union, citing difficult trade discussions. The markets are expected to remain volatile, with concerns over rising debt and ongoing tariff policies creating different realities for equity and bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition causing issues with hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. NPH involves a buildup of fluid around the brain, which can cause pressure on normal brain tissue. The condition is relatively uncommon and more likely to occur in older people, but is usually treatable with a surgical procedure to drain the fluid.</p>
