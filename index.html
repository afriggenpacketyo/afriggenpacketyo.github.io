            <p>Two political appointees at the Pentagon, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were terminated following a leak investigation initiated by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff. The investigation, prompted by unauthorized disclosures, involved reviewing potential leaks and considering polygraph tests. Colin Carroll, chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, was also placed on administrative leave as part of the probe. There are discussions about suspending more officials in what appears to be a widespread investigation into leaks to news outlets.</p>

            <p>Tasneem Abbas, a 16-year-old Palestinian girl who lost her arm in an Israeli bombing in Gaza, has arrived in Philadelphia to receive medical treatment. After months of coordination, Abbas and her sister Ashjan were hosted by a local family and supported by the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF). The community has rallied to provide support, and Shriners Children’s Philadelphia is covering the cost of her prosthetic limb and medical treatment. While Abbas’s story is one of hope, thousands of other children in Gaza lack access to adequate medical care, and the future remains uncertain as her visa renewal approaches. </p>

            <p>U.S. chocolate prices are surging due to soaring cocoa costs caused by climate-related crises in West Africa, where 70% of the world's cocoa is harvested. Additionally, Trump's tariffs on imports are expected to further increase chocolate prices, as shifting manufacturing to the U.S. is not feasible due to the tropical climate required for cacao plants. Smaller chocolate businesses are particularly vulnerable to these unstable conditions, as they lack the leverage and resources of larger manufacturers. The rise in prices poses a challenge for consumers and the chocolate industry alike.</p>

            <p>The article contrasts President Trump's hard-line immigration policies with the Christian message of love and charity during Holy Week. Trump's administration is criticized for denying birthright citizenship, rescinding legal status for migrants, and deporting individuals like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national. The author argues that Trump's actions embody the worst of humanity, reminiscent of figures like Judas and Pontius Pilate from the Bible, and calls for standing with the least among us to uphold good against evil.</p>

            <p>China's beach resorts, particularly in Sanya, Hainan province, are experiencing a surge in Russian tourists. The increase in Russian visitors is helping the local travel sector recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. The rise is attributed to a general recovery in Russian outbound tourism and China's relaxed visa policies. The influx of Russian tourists has led to the prevalence of Russian language and culture in the area, with signs and menus often translated into Russian.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelan migrants detained under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law. The ACLU challenged the deportations, arguing that the migrants were not given a chance to contest their removal. The lawsuit stated that some detainees received deportation notices in English, despite only speaking Spanish, and were not informed of their right to challenge the decision in court. This order follows a previous ruling that allowed the Trump administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, provided they are given a court hearing.</p>

            <p>Since assuming office, Donald Trump has prioritized mass deportations, resulting in controversial removals to El Salvador's mega-prison and a surge in immigration arrests. The Supreme Court issued an emergency order to halt deportations of Venezuelans, prompting an examination of the Trump administration's deportation efforts. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has been invoked to deport immigrants identified as criminals, raising concerns about due process. Despite these efforts, data shows that the Trump administration's deportations in its first month were slightly behind those under Joe Biden at the same time last year.</p>
