          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence tools to improve their online dating experiences, according to a recent study. AI-powered dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler help users craft witty messages, navigate conversations, and even handle difficult situations like being "ghosted." While these apps can boost confidence for those who struggle with writing, their rising popularity also sparks questions about authenticity and the risk of over-reliance on technology for human connection. Experts suggest these tools can be helpful supplements but should not become a substitute for genuine interaction.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of notorious drug lord "El Chapo," has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea deal, he admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation that funneled vast quantities of the opioid into the U.S. Guzman Lopez has agreed to cooperate with federal authorities, which may lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. This cooperation could require him to provide significant details about his family's cartel operations, potentially including testifying against his own brother.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau on the fatal Air India crash has revealed a critical detail from the flight recorders. Moments after the Boeing 787 took off, the fuel control switches for both engines were moved from the "run" to the "cutoff" position, causing a loss of thrust. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. The investigation into the crash, which killed 260 people, is ongoing and has not yet assigned blame or found evidence of mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>During a visit to central Texas following devastating flash floods that killed over 120 people, President Donald Trump praised the response from local, state, and federal agencies as "incredible." When a reporter questioned the timeliness of the flood warnings, Trump dismissed the query as coming from an "evil person," insisting that everyone involved had performed heroically under unprecedented circumstances. The article notes this supportive tone contrasts sharply with his past criticisms of disaster management in states led by his political opponents, highlighting his close relationship with Texas's Republican governor.</p>

          <p>Two employees at an Arkansas prison have been fired for policy violations that directly led to the escape of inmate Grant Hardin, known as the “Devil in the Ozarks.” According to corrections officials, one employee allowed Hardin unsupervised access to an outside dock, while another opened a gate for him without proper identity confirmation. Hardin escaped wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform. While officials have fired the two individuals, lawmakers on an oversight panel argue that the incident points to deeper, systemic problems within the facility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods starting August 1, a threat delivered via his social media platform. The letter tied the potential tariffs to several issues, including Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl, existing levies on U.S. dairy, and the trade deficit. This move escalates trade tensions between the two nations, even as they approach a deadline for a new trade agreement, with the Canadian Prime Minister vowing to protect his country's workers and businesses.

          <p>Crystal Palace is set to lose its hard-won place in the Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations, with Nottingham Forest poised to take the spot instead. The conflict arises from John Textor's ownership stake in both Palace and French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. Because Palace missed a key deadline to alter its ownership structure to comply with the rules, and Lyon finished higher in their respective league, the French club was given priority, leaving Palace to compete in the lower-tier Conference League.</p>

For Ukrainians, the flight was a symbol of resilience and a demonstration of their ability to operate within their own airspace.

This monthly surplus provides a temporary bright spot in the nation's finances, though it comes against the backdrop of a fiscal year-to-date deficit of $1.34 trillion and rising interest payments on the national debt.
