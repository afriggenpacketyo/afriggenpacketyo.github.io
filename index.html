            <p>A Greenlandic geologist warns that the prospect of a mineral bonanza in Greenland is a mirage, challenging the Trump administration's interest in acquiring the territory. Minik Rosing argues that Greenland does not have a unique concentration of rare earth minerals and that extracting them would be difficult and costly. He also points out that the U.S. lacks the processing facilities to refine these minerals, which are largely controlled by China. Rosing suggests that the focus should be on developing processing capabilities and fostering a competitive market rather than acquiring more territory. Optimism score: 50</p>

The U.S.'s interest in Greenland dates back to the 19th century, but Trump's overtures have fueled a spirit of independence and prompted locals to reassess their relationship with Denmark.
