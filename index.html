          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue that the legislation will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private schools, while supporters say it will give parents the freedom to choose the best educational option for their children.</p>

The end of the exemption, which allowed packages worth $800 to enter the country without import levies, will lead to higher costs for many goods. Trade experts also anticipate administrative challenges and potential delays in shipments due to increased inspections by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs, raising questions about the country's ability to build large-scale infrastructure. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now limited to a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser argues that eminent domain is not the primary cause of the delays. The project has faced challenges related to property acquisition, environmental regulations, and funding, impacting farmers and communities in the Central Valley.</p>
