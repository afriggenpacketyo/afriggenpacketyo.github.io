          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass declared a local emergency and imposed a curfew for downtown Los Angeles, effective from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests that have resulted in vandalism and looting. The curfew applies to a one-square-mile area encircled by major freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and individuals experiencing homelessness. The decision follows several days of unrest and nearly 469 arrests, prompting the deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal properties and personnel. Bass emphasized that the curfew aims to protect lives and property, warning that violators will face arrest and prosecution.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom delivered a scathing address accusing President Trump of undermining democracy by deploying military forces to Los Angeles and targeting immigrant communities. Newsom claimed that Trump's immigration crackdown extended beyond criminals, detaining ordinary workers and families, and that the deployment of the National Guard without his consent was an abuse of power. He asserted that Trump intentionally incited violence to divert attention from his actions in Washington, warning other states that they could be next. Newsom called on Americans to stand up against Trump's actions and uphold democratic values.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver was indicted on three counts of assaulting federal law enforcement officers during a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center last month. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and other members of Congress attempted to conduct oversight of the detention center, leading to a scuffle between protesters and law enforcement. Authorities allege that McIver physically interfered with officers during the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was also arrested for trespassing. McIver has denied the charges, calling the indictment a politically motivated attempt to intimidate her, while U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a close ally of Trump, is prosecuting the case.</p>

The incident, captured on video, showed a vehicle moving through protesters, with a police officer attempting to stop the driver. While most Chicago protesters remained peaceful, some clashed with police and vandalized vehicles, leading to temporary suspensions of public transportation. Alderman Raymond Lopez criticized the anarchy and property damage, while protesters expressed concerns about immigration enforcement practices, stating people are being taken off the street.

          <p>The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) suffered a 4-0 defeat against Switzerland in a friendly match, marking their fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2007. Switzerland dominated the first half, scoring all four goals and exposing vulnerabilities in the American defense. The match, played a year before the 2026 World Cup, raised concerns about the team's preparedness, especially with several key players missing. Coach Mauricio Pochettino made numerous changes to the lineup, providing opportunities for new players but failing to produce a cohesive performance. The result extends the USMNT’s winless streak against European opponents since 2021.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted President Trump to deploy additional military personnel, leading to legal challenges from California Governor Gavin Newsom. The deployment includes Marines and National Guard troops, with an estimated cost of $134 million. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a curfew for downtown to curb vandalism and looting, while tensions escalate between protesters and law enforcement. The protests are a response to immigration raids that have resulted in numerous arrests, with officials citing the California Values Act as a constraint on local law enforcement's involvement in federal immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to restore the original names of several Army bases that previously honored Confederate military figures, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress and completed under President Biden. However, the bases will now be named after other service members with similar names, rather than Confederates. The move affects bases such as Fort Gordon, Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Hood, Fort Lee, Fort Pickett, Fort Polk, and Fort Rucker, with Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll tasked with implementing the changes. This decision unwinds efforts by the Naming Commission, which aimed to remove Confederate symbols, and reflects Trump's sentiment that there's no need to change names after winning battles from those forts.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of serious disorder as fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs were thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The violence, described by police as racially motivated, followed an earlier peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Homes and businesses were attacked, with some properties displaying signs indicating the nationalities of the residents. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some attributing the tensions to an oversubscription of migrants in the area, while others criticized such explanations as insincere.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area to join National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of troops onto city streets, arguing it is an overreach of federal authority. The state's filing requests a temporary restraining order to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active duty Marines for law enforcement purposes. The U.S. Northern Command stated that the Marines would integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property.

          <p>An appellate court ruled that the wide-reaching tariffs imposed by President Trump can remain in effect until at least the end of July, granting the administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for July 31, meaning the tariffs will stay in place unless further court action occurs. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled that many of Mr. Trump's signature tariffs are illegal, but the appellate court quickly paused that ruling from taking effect. The legal battle over the tariffs continues, with the president justifying them using a 1977 law that lets the president regulate imports during emergency situations. (not investment advice)</p>

Tesla has been testing driverless vehicles on Austin roads without a human safety supervisor behind the wheel, and Musk plans a small rollout with a new, "unsupervised" version of Tesla's FSD technology. The service will initially be "geofenced" and remotely monitored by employees, and is expected to include Model Y cars, not the CyberCab.
