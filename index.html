          <p>A man in southern Turkey sustained serious injuries after being attacked by a lion that had escaped from a nearby zoo. The 53-year-old man was sleeping outdoors when the lion, named Zeus, pounced on him, leading to a struggle before the animal fled. The lion was later located by police and shot dead. The incident occurred at the Land of Lions park in Manavgat, and an investigation is underway to determine how the animal managed to escape its enclosure.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods have struck central Texas, resulting in at least 50 fatalities and leaving over two dozen people, including campers from a children's summer camp, missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, with some areas seeing a 26-foot surge in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and leading to hundreds of air and water rescues. Officials, including the governor, have declared a disaster, acknowledging that the rainfall's intensity far exceeded forecasts. The search for survivors continues amid widespread devastation, with many homes and infrastructure destroyed.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee of nearly £60 million. The 26-year-old deep-lying midfielder has signed a five-year contract, becoming the club's second major summer acquisition. The deal was reportedly in the works for over a year, with Arsenal choosing to pay more than the player's release clause to structure the payments. Zubimendi, who rejected an approach from Liverpool last year, was said to be captivated by the prospect of working with manager Mikel Arteta. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Three's Company" actress Jenilee Harrison recently reflected on her experience posing for Playboy magazine in 1987, revealing she contractually refused to appear nude. Harrison explained that she had to stand her ground when the photographer was surprised by her insistence on being clothed, forcing a halt in the photoshoot to procure a wardrobe. She discussed the discomfort of being viewed as a sex symbol, preferring to be recognized for her acting work rather than her appearance. Harrison is now co-hosting a podcast titled "Stall Talk," sharing personal stories and wisdom.</p>

          <p>A recent trend among Black artists like Beyoncé is prompting a broader conversation about the complex relationship between the Black community and the American flag. Ted Johnson, a retired US Navy commander, explains that for many, the flag represents both a set of ideals worth defending and a history of oppression enacted under its banner. The act of reclaiming the flag is seen by some as an assertion of ownership and belonging, acknowledging the progress made since the Civil Rights era. However, this patriotism is nuanced, honoring the sacrifices of ancestors while not excusing the nation's ongoing struggles with racial inequality.</p>

          <p>A key federal advisory committee has recommended that flu shots for all age groups be made without thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. This move comes despite a long history of the ingredient's safe use and the fact that 94% of current flu shots are already thimerosal-free. Critics of the decision, including one dissenting committee member, argue it addresses a non-existent problem, as scientific evidence has repeatedly debunked any link between thimerosal and health issues like autism. The recommendation now awaits a final decision from the CDC, with some experts concerned it could undermine vaccine confidence.</p>

          <p>The UK's Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has stated that a recent government U-turn on welfare reforms has made future spending decisions, including the potential removal of the two-child benefit cap, more difficult. The government was forced to retreat on a package of welfare changes, losing potential savings and putting pressure on the upcoming budget. While a child poverty taskforce is considering scrapping the cap, which affects 1.6 million children, the chancellor has indicated she is not committed to any specific policy. The move to keep the cap is framed as a fiscally responsible decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The program, initiated by George W. Bush and credited with saving 26 million lives, has been hobbled by recent administrative actions, yet many of its former religious supporters are now silent. The analysis suggests a combination of factors, including ignorance of the program's status, compassion fatigue, aversion to political controversy, and fealty to the current administration. This silence contrasts sharply with the community's vocal stance on other culture war issues.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a novel data sorting system that is faster and more energy-efficient, potentially overcoming a key bottleneck in AI and high-performance computing. The system utilizes memristors, electronic components that combine memory and processing functions, to perform "sort-in-memory" operations. This approach helps to mitigate the "Von Neumann bottleneck," which limits the speed of data transfer between a system's memory and its central processing unit. The researchers from Peking University demonstrated the prototype's effectiveness in tasks like route finding and neural network inference.</p>

          <p>The family of a Canadian woman, who has lived in the U.S. without legal status since she was a child, reports feeling betrayed after she was detained by ICE agents during her permanent residency interview. Her husband, a U.S. citizen and Trump supporter, said he voted for the president based on his promise to deport dangerous criminals, never believing it would apply to his wife, who has no criminal record. The 45-year-old mother of three U.S.-born children is now in a detention center awaiting deportation to Canada. An ICE spokesperson confirmed her status as an "illegal alien" who will be removed.</p>

The effort allegedly targeted countries that have purchased or are considering purchasing the Rafale, promoting Chinese-made alternatives instead.

          <p>In the wake of the catastrophic flash floods in central Texas that have killed at least 51 people, questions are being raised about the timeliness and effectiveness of the warnings issued to residents. While forecasters state they sent alerts hours in advance, local officials and residents claim they were unprepared for the flood's unprecedented intensity, with the Guadalupe River rising dramatically in under an hour. Some officials noted that earlier forecasts did not predict the extreme amount of rain that fell. The disaster has sparked a debate over the adequacy of current flood warning systems in a notoriously flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has shown that a single injection of a gene therapy can reverse a form of congenital deafness and severe hearing impairment in both children and adults. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain, directly to the inner ear. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial showed significant hearing improvement within weeks, with one 7-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for treating other forms of genetic deafness.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, England, who personally apprehended a man stealing a crate of beer, expressed frustration with the lack of legal consequences for the offender. The thief was dealt with through a "community resolution," which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The store owner, Andrew Board, argues this sends the wrong signal and fails to deter repeat offenses, reflecting a national trend where most shoplifting reports do not lead to charges. He has been forced to remove high-theft items from his shelves due to frequent incidents.</p>
