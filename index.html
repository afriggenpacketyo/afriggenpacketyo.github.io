        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the government's increasing debt and interest payment ratios, which are significantly higher than those of similarly rated countries. The credit rating firm noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. Moody's expects federal deficits to increase from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% by 2035, driven by rising interest payments, increased entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. The downgrade occurred as the House Budget Committee rejected President Trump's domestic policy bill, which would extend tax cuts from his first term, potentially adding $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade.

          <p>Danette Colbert, awaiting trial for the murder of Telemundo reporter Adan Manzano, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for a 2021 case of drugging and robbing a man. Colbert had her probation revoked under Louisiana’s repeat offender law, a decision praised by Attorney General Liz Murrill who argued Colbert should have been incarcerated earlier. Colbert is accused of drugging and robbing Manzano, who was found dead from a combination of drugs, alcohol, and positional asphyxia after covering Super Bowl LIX. Several other men have come forward alleging similar experiences of being drugged and robbed by Colbert in New Orleans, criticizing the initial suspended sentence she received in the 2021 case.</p>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles fires, many residents from Altadena and Pacific Palisades have been displaced, moving across Los Angeles and even to other states, disrupting tight-knit communities. A New York Times analysis of change of address records revealed that over half of those displaced moved at least a half-hour's drive away, while a quarter left the Los Angeles metro area entirely, settling in areas with higher population density. The fires, which occurred amid high Santa Ana winds in January, destroyed thousands of homes and properties, leading to challenges such as school transfers, longer commutes, and the loss of neighborhood relationships. While most displaced residents relocated within Southern California, Texas and Florida were the top out-of-state destinations.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports, along with The Guardian and FERN, conducted an investigation that found price tag errors at Kroger stores, leading to customers being overcharged for items marked as on sale. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, revealed expired discount tags on numerous products, resulting in an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. While Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors were minimal compared to the volume of transactions, the issue raises concerns about pricing accuracy and potential customer distrust.</p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing rising debt levels and the potential for further fiscal deterioration if new tax cuts are enacted. This downgrade signifies that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the U.S. their highest rating, reflecting concerns about gridlock and dysfunction in Washington. The agency pointed to the failure of successive administrations to address rising debt and underfunded programs like Social Security and Medicare. Despite the downgrade, the U.S. financial system is considered stable, and the dollar remains strong.</p>

Real-time data indicates a substantial decrease in murder, violent crime, and property crime.

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the U.S. after a 2005 removal order. ICE is charging the woman $500 for every day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. The woman's attorney, Michelle Sanchez, is appealing the fine, arguing that her client was never advised of the consequences and is the mother of three U.S. citizen children. This case reflects the Trump administration's plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>
