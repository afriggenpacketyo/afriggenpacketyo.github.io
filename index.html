          <p>This article details the experiences of immigrants in Southern California facing increased enforcement by ICE. Following campaign promises, the Trump administration has intensified immigration raids, creating fear within the undocumented community. The article recounts a specific raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles, where ICE agents, allegedly supported by local law enforcement, detained around 25 people. The piece also highlights the economic impact of these raids, as immigrants become afraid to seek work, and emphasizes the psychological toll on those living in constant fear of deportation.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team has signaled a change in strategy, indicating they will present their case in a shorter timeframe than initially anticipated. Legal experts suggest this shift may reflect perceived weaknesses in the prosecution's case, which relies heavily on testimony from former associates. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, and the defense may be aiming to emphasize the prosecution's burden of proof. The judge has also cautioned both sides against violating a sealing order by speaking to the media, and the jury has been shown videos and text messages related to the case.</p>

Under the new rules, donors will be asked about anal sex with new or multiple partners, rather than their sexual orientation, and those taking HIV prevention drugs will be eligible to donate plasma.

          <p>The leaders of the G7 nations have launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, largely due to overreliance on China. The plan involves increased cooperation among G7 members and like-minded countries to safeguard economic security against nonmarket practices. The areas of cooperation include monitoring shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining and processing. The G7 also intends to develop a road map for standards-based markets for critical minerals, reflecting extraction and trade costs.</p>
