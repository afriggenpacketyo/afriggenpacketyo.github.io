          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. is planning to meet with Iran the following week, following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Speaking at a news conference after a NATO summit in The Hague, Trump mentioned that a formal agreement with Iran might not be necessary due to the destruction of their nuclear sites. He emphasized that the U.S. is primarily concerned with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, noting that recent strikes have significantly hampered their enrichment efforts, potentially setting them back for decades. Trump also addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict, expressing optimism about progress being made in Gaza. The president's remarks followed meetings with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, discussing defense spending and peace efforts.

          <p>Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for President Trump and current DOJ official, faced a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship. Bove disputed claims that he acted as Trump's "henchman," asserting his independence and integrity.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran is merely a tactical intermission rather than a resolution to the ongoing conflict. Despite the announced ceasefire, both countries reportedly engaged in limited retaliatory actions, underscoring the fragility of the agreement. The author suggests that the war has shifted forms, with the shadow war continuing through proxy warfare, cyber operations, and intelligence targeting. The lack of a formal treaty, verification regime, or mutual recognition of legitimacy between the two states further highlights the unresolved nature of the conflict.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in its incarceration rate, potentially reaching a 60% reduction in the prison population by the next decade. After peaking at over 1.6 million in 2009, the prison population fell to 1.2 million by the end of 2023 and is projected to drop to around 600,000. This decline is attributed to falling crime rates since the 1990s and a lower-crime generation not replacing the older, high-crime generation at an equal rate. The trend is expected to continue, with the imprisonment rate potentially falling as low as 200 per 100,000 people by 2035, which may cause states to tear down their most deteriorated and inhumane correctional facilities.

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have declined for the fifth consecutive month in May, with a 27.9% year-on-year decrease. This decline is attributed to increasing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles, leading to a drop in Tesla's European market share from 1.8% to 1.2%. The company has also faced brand and reputational challenges, partly due to CEO Elon Musk's political activities and rhetoric. Despite these challenges, Tesla continues to compete with traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD, which has recently outsold Tesla in Europe.

          <p>The Club World Cup in the USA has been marked by slow-paced matches, sweltering players, and complaints about extreme heat, leading to criticism that FIFA is not taking the dangers seriously enough. Environmental advocacy groups warn of a "perfect storm" of unsafe conditions at major events like the 2026 World Cup. Despite FIFA's claims of implementing preventative measures like cooling breaks, many believe these are insufficient, particularly with the expanded format of the 2026 World Cup set to be played in similar conditions.
