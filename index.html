          <p>Lindsay Lohan is celebrating her return to Hollywood with the premiere of "Freakier Friday," a sequel to the beloved 2003 film. She expressed that her motivation for the project was to bring joy to audiences, especially given the current state of world events. Lohan also reflected on how becoming a mother has given her a new perspective on the film's mother-daughter themes and helped her balance her career and personal life. Co-star Jamie Lee Curtis noted that their bond has remained strong over the years and that the sequel's themes of understanding and empathy are particularly relevant today.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially modified its tariff schedule, imposing new duties on numerous countries that range from 10% to as high as 41% for nations like Syria. The executive order also introduces a significant 40% tariff on any goods that are transshipped through other countries to evade the primary duties. While some Asian nations received slightly lower rates than previously announced, tariffs on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA will increase to 35%. The move has created further uncertainty in global markets, with Asian indexes falling in response to the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An office cleaner has shared her harrowing experience of coming face-to-face with the gunman during the recent mass shooting in a Manhattan office tower. Sebije Nelovic, 65, stated that the attacker pointed his rifle at her before she managed to flee and lock herself in a closet, where she hid for several hours while praying. The gunman, who killed four people before taking his own life, was reportedly targeting the NFL headquarters but went to the wrong floor. A note found on the suspect suggested he believed he suffered from CTE and asked for his brain to be studied.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has acknowledged for the first time that an air traffic controller made an error preceding the fatal midair collision over Washington D.C. in January. An FAA official testified at an NTSB hearing that the controller should have explicitly warned the commercial plane's crew that an Army helicopter was in its path. The hearing also revealed that controllers at the busy airport felt they were "pushing the line" on safety by using nonstandard procedures to manage high traffic volume. This included relying on helicopter pilots for visual separation and using a shorter runway for jets.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died this year, has stated that she strongly supported the public release of documents related to the case. Her siblings said Giuffre fought for transparency and justice for victims until the very end. They also expressed shock at President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, emphasizing that she was a person who was recruited, not an object. The family urged the president not to consider a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

The government stated the hike is in line with inflation, while universities have been advocating for more funding due to financial pressures. The increase comes as students also face sharply rising accommodation costs and depend more on maintenance loans, which have also been slightly increased. Critics note that recent changes to loan repayment rules in England mean many graduates will likely pay back more over a longer period.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels chose to be modest buyers at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring two veteran relief pitchers and an infielder in exchange for minor league prospects. With the team under .500 and facing long odds to make the playoffs, the strategy has been met with some criticism. General Manager Perry Minasian defended the decision, stating the goal was to remain competitive and provide young core players with the experience of playing meaningful games in August and September. However, the moves stand in contrast to other wild-card contenders who made more significant acquisitions to bolster their rosters.</p>

According to the press secretary, funding for the new building will come from President Trump himself and other "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948 and will replace the current East Wing.</p>

          <p>Researchers have published a study in the journal Cell suggesting an unexpected evolutionary link between two common foods: the potato and the tomato. According to the scientists, the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event with another wild species. The study proposes that a gene from the ancient tomato, which does not produce tubers, combined with a gene from the other species to enable the formation of the starchy tubers we know today. This finding helps solve a long-standing puzzle about the potato's genetic origins.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has uncovered that China is systematically evading U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of tankers to secretly purchase Iranian oil. The operation involves ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers often turning off their transponders and covering their names to avoid identification. This illicit trade, which props up the Iranian regime and its nuclear program, is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran.

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its second quarter, with sales increasing 13% to $167.7 billion. Despite the strong top-and-bottom-line beats, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading. Investors were reportedly underwhelmed by a relatively small revenue beat from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division and mixed guidance for the third quarter. The company's forecast for operating income fell short of Wall Street expectations, raising some concerns even as Amazon projects another quarter of healthy overall revenue growth.

          <p>A growing trend among U.S. teenagers using small, teabag-like caffeine pouches is causing concern among health experts. These products, which are placed between the lip and gum, deliver a rapid and potent dose of caffeine directly into the bloodstream, with a single pouch containing as much as two cups of coffee. Experts worry that the discreet nature of the pouches and their promotion by social media influencers could lead to overuse and dangerous side effects, such as rapid heart rate and seizures. They also caution that it could be a gateway to using other oral products like nicotine pouches.</p>

          <p>A surge in cases of Chikungunya fever in southern China has prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to consider issuing a travel notice for the country. The mosquito-borne illness has seen over 5,000 cases reported since last month, with the majority concentrated in Guangdong province. The Chikungunya virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and its most common symptoms are fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms can include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and rashes, which can be debilitating for those infected with the disease.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have long served as economic engines for southern China, are reporting underperforming GDP growth, signaling a potential loss of momentum. Analysts attribute the simultaneous slowdown to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and a significant downturn in the local property market. In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment and real estate development have both plunged, reflecting a drop in investor confidence. The trend has prompted calls for stronger government action to revive business activity and counteract the dual headwinds facing the region.</p>

          <p>The UK's new Online Safety Act has resulted in social media companies like X and Reddit broadly restricting content, including posts about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, for users who have not completed age verification. BBC Verify found that a range of public interest content, including a video of a destroyed drone and a parliamentary debate on grooming gangs, was blocked. Experts warn that companies, in their effort to comply with the law and avoid hefty fines, are over-applying the rules and risk stifling legitimate public debate and suppressing factual information.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reforming its civil service internship program to exclusively recruit students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves by harnessing a broader range of talent. Under the new rules, eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will then be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the main graduate entry program, creating a new pipeline for working-class students into senior government roles.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has provided more details on his plan to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts by potentially calling a special election on November 4. The election would ask voters to approve new congressional maps drawn by the legislature, which would remain in effect through 2030. Newsom casts the move as a direct response to President Trump's call for states like Texas to redraw their maps to secure a GOP House majority. The governor stated that while the cost is not yet determined, preserving democracy is "priceless" and that the process would be transparent.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski, a man convicted of killing his wife and two children in 1994, marking the state's ninth execution this year. This total sets a new single-year record for the state since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, surpassing the previous high of eight. Florida has now carried out more executions in 2025 than any other state. Opponents of the execution had pointed to Zakrzewski's military service and the fact that his original jury recommendation for death was a narrow 7-5 vote, a split that would not be sufficient for a death sentence under current state law.</p>

          <p>Will Lansing, the CEO of Fair Isaac (FICO), has pushed back against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency regarding his company's pricing. In an interview, Lansing argued that the cost of a FICO score, which he stated is $4.95 for a mortgage, is not a significant barrier to homeownership when compared to the thousands of dollars in total closing costs. The defense comes after the FHFA head criticized FICO's price hikes and announced that mortgage lenders can now use a rival score from VantageScore, ending FICO's exclusive use for government-backed loans.
