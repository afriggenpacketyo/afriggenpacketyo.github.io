          <p>The BBC postponed a documentary about Ozzy Osbourne's final years out of respect for his family's wishes following his recent death at 76. The film, "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," was originally scheduled to air less than a month after he passed away. It was adapted from a planned series and covers the last three years of his life, including his return to the UK and his farewell concert. The broadcast has been rescheduled, with a new date to be announced soon.</p>

          <p>Major luxury conglomerates such as LVMH and Kering are experiencing a significant slowdown in sales after a post-COVID boom. Factors contributing to the decline include reduced spending from aspirational buyers, slowing demand in China, and general economic uncertainty. Analysts note that rising prices, declining quality, and the increased availability of discounted overstock are eroding the brands' exclusivity and appeal. The industry faces its biggest setback since the 2008 financial crisis, though some experts predict a future rebound driven by an increase in high-net-worth individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States Director of National Intelligence announced that the UK has rescinded its demand for Apple to create a "back door" into its encrypted services. The UK government had previously issued a formal notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, which would have required Apple to provide access to global user data. In response, Apple had withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection feature from the UK market and initiated a legal challenge. Privacy advocates have cautiously welcomed the development, though Apple has not yet received formal confirmation of the policy reversal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing acquiring a 10% stake in Intel, which would make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. The plan involves potentially converting some or all of Intel's $10.9 billion in CHIPS and Science Act grants into equity in the company. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and bolster national security, as Intel has fallen behind global competitors. While the discussions are ongoing, it highlights the administration's interest in creating government-backed national champions in strategic sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

This market reaction occurred amidst a broader downturn in Asia-Pacific markets, as investors anticipated an upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. The investment itself reflects a belief in the expansion of advanced semiconductor manufacturing within the United States, with Intel expected to play a crucial role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev publicly taunted European leaders after their meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding the war in Ukraine. On social media, Medvedev claimed the "anti-Russian warmongering Coalition of the Willing" had failed to influence Trump and had instead "sucked up" to him. He also derisively questioned what message Zelenskyy would deliver back home about security guarantees and territorial concessions. The comments reflect Russia's dismissive stance towards the diplomatic efforts aimed at coordinating a Western approach to ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Helsinki has become one of the largest European cities to record zero traffic-related deaths in a year, a significant achievement in urban safety. The Finnish capital's success is attributed to a comprehensive strategy that includes lowering speed limits to 30 km/h on most city streets, particularly around schools. The city also utilizes extensive data collection to identify and redesign dangerous intersections, improves infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, and enhances public transport. This approach is part of the EU's "Vision Zero" program, which aims to eliminate road fatalities by 2050.</p>

On aesthetics, the 1990 Ferrari 641 is highlighted as a work of art, having been displayed in New York's Museum of Modern Art. The piece also explains that a car's performance differs between qualifying and a race due to how peak tire grip can mask underlying flaws, which become apparent over a long stint as tires degrade.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the prospect of peace in Ukraine has diminished following President Trump's recent diplomatic engagements. The consensus among allies was that ending the war required an immediate ceasefire and stronger sanctions against Russia, but Trump has now reversed his position on both points, aligning more closely with Vladimir Putin's stance. There is now immense pressure on President Zelenskyy to cede territory in exchange for vague security guarantees, which are viewed with skepticism. The article suggests that while the diplomatic activity may suit Trump's desire for attention, it moves further from a resolution that protects Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a three-year prison sentence set a new precedent for pay-per-view spectacles. His fight against Peter McNeeley, while lasting only 89 seconds and ending in a farcical disqualification, shattered revenue records and drew a massive celebrity audience. The event demonstrated that a superstar's drawing power could transcend the competitiveness of the actual match. This focus on spectacle over sport paved the way for modern crossover events, such as those involving YouTubers and MMA fighters, proving that a compelling narrative can be more lucrative than a well-matched contest.</p>

The experience forced her to confront how society's contradictory health messages can inadvertently trigger past disorders, even when the goal is physical well-being.</p>

          <p>The family of Thomas Callam Phillips, a New Zealand man who disappeared with his three young children nearly four years ago, has made a public appeal for him to come home. Phillips and his children—now believed to be ages 9, 10, and 12—vanished in December 2021 and are thought to be living off-grid in a dense wilderness area. Police are concerned for the children's welfare and have offered a significant reward for information leading to their safe return. Phillips is also wanted for several alleged crimes, including an armed bank robbery committed while on the run.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the season, is not expected to make landfall in the U.S. but will likely generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast. The storm, currently a Category 3 hurricane, is tracking northward between Bermuda and the U.S. mainland. While the storm's center will remain offshore, its large size means coastal areas will experience significant effects, prompting warnings and evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks. Forecasters urge the public to heed local warnings and avoid the ocean for much of the week due to the life-threatening conditions.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled images of what appears to be its first crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, a design that combines the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane. The photos show a prototype hovering in helicopter mode, with a cockpit design suggesting it is manned. This technology, famously used in the U.S. V-22 Osprey, is mechanically complex and costly but offers significant tactical advantages. The development marks a notable advancement in China's military aviation capabilities, though details about its performance and intended role remain undisclosed.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong government has summoned the top diplomats from the UK and Australia to protest their decisions to grant asylum to two pro-democracy activists. Former lawmaker Ted Hui received asylum in Australia, while student leader Tony Chung was granted refugee status in the UK. Hong Kong's Chief Secretary warned the envoys against "harbouring offenders," stating that the arrests were based on evidence, not political stances. Both activists had been sentenced under the city's national security law, which critics argue is used to suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>A high-level meeting in Washington involving Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, along with a delegation of European leaders, has resulted in progress on potential U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine. While Trump has shifted his stance to oppose an immediate ceasefire, he has committed to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin. The European leaders' presence aimed to present a united front and counter a pro-Russian tilt from the White House. The atmosphere was reportedly more constructive than the leaders' previous encounter, though significant disagreements on the path to peace remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used artificial intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were deported to Australia in the 19th century. By combining detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases photos of modern descendants, a team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey. These convicts were often transported for petty crimes like theft. The project sheds light on a significant period of history when an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, forming a foundational part of the country's population and heritage.</p>

          <p>A woman who was sexually assaulted by a fellow passenger on a flight to the UK has been denied compensation from the government's criminal injuries scheme. The perpetrator has been jailed, but the victim's application was rejected because the crime occurred on a Qatari-registered aircraft, not a British one. Although UK law was amended to allow for the prosecution of such crimes, the compensation scheme's rules were not updated accordingly. Her lawyers are now calling on the Justice Secretary to close this legal loophole, arguing it is irrational and unfair to deny compensation to victims.</p>

Furthermore, the U.S. president interrupted his meeting with seven European and Ukrainian leaders to take a phone call with Putin, suggesting the Russian leader's views were prioritized.

Recent record-breaking temperatures and wildfires across Southern Europe have accelerated this shift. Travel industry data shows growing interest in Nordic countries, the Baltics, and alpine regions, as well as a preference for traveling in the shoulder seasons of spring and autumn.
