        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a mixed bag of challenges and opportunities for central banks globally, as a weaker dollar can alleviate debt burdens for emerging markets but also complicate export competitiveness. While some countries may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, they risk capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. due to trade measures. The European Central Bank has already cut rates, and other central banks are cautiously weighing their options to balance inflation and economic growth. For now, most central banks are avoiding actions that could trigger a currency war, which would further destabilize the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose visas were allegedly unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated student records, effectively making them deportable. The judge's order prevents the administration from using the students' identities outside the lawsuit and requires notification upon compliance. This legal challenge highlights concerns about the administration's approach to immigration enforcement and its impact on international students.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed both U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs and housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson in the Republican primary for Arizona governor. This unusual move reflects Trump's strategy of maintaining influence within the party while avoiding alienating key allies.

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on sourcing products from China and selling to markets like the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to increasing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further exacerbates the pressure.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, including approximately 1,650 layoffs. The proposed spending plan includes funding for new hires at the Fire Department but would result in deep spending reductions for other agencies, including the LAPD. The layoffs are a response to rising personnel costs, legal payouts, and a slowing local economy. Union leaders have vowed to fight the proposed cuts.</p>

The map details connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, which could help understand its role in cognitive functions. The research also revealed structural and cellular differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, potentially offering insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness.
