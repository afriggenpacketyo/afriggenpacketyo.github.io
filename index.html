          <p>In a significant act of cooperation, Mexico has extradited 26 prominent cartel members to the U.S. to face charges for drug trafficking, murder, and other violent crimes. This group includes leaders from the notorious CJNG and Sinaloa cartels, such as Abigael González Valencia of "Los Cuinis." The transfer occurs amidst ongoing pressure from the Trump administration for Mexico to intensify its crackdown on criminal organizations responsible for smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics. Both nations have hailed the move as a crucial step toward dismantling these dangerous networks and ensuring public safety.</p>

A significant highlight was the surge in AI infrastructure orders, which exceeded $2 billion for the fiscal year, more than doubling the company's target.

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing unprecedented flooding after a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive volume of water. The Mendenhall River crested at a record 16.65 feet, surpassing the previous high and forcing evacuations in vulnerable areas. This annual "outburst flood" event, exacerbated by climate change, has intensified in recent years, destroying homes and infrastructure. While temporary barriers have been installed, a permanent solution is still years away, leaving the community to face recurring and escalating threats from the melting glacier.</p>

Trump stated he was heavily involved in the selection process to exclude "wokesters" and complained he had never received the award himself. This move represents a significant shift from his first term, where he avoided the ceremony, and is seen as part of a broader effort to exert influence over the nation's cultural institutions. The President also promised a full renovation of the arts complex.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of Comedy Central's "South Park" is experiencing a significant ratings surge, with viewership climbing to its highest levels since 2018. This success is largely attributed to its sharp, satirical takes on political figures, including President Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The second episode, which featured these parodies, saw a 49% viewership increase over the season premiere, drawing 6.2 million viewers in its first three days. The renewed popularity comes as the show's creators continue their unflinching comedic commentary amidst a tense political climate.</p>

          <p>Two suspects who led police on a prolonged and chaotic chase through Los Angeles remain at large after a sophisticated escape. The pursuit involved multiple carjackings, including a semi-truck, and a high-speed, wrong-way freeway drive before the suspects disappeared under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights. Authorities believe the pair were aided by accomplices in a waiting vehicle, a rare outcome for such a highly televised event. Law enforcement is now analyzing forensic evidence from the abandoned vehicles in an effort to identify and apprehend the fugitives.</p>

          <p>Researchers predict that global reindeer populations could decline substantially by the end of the century, with North American caribou facing a potential drop of up to 80%. A study led by the University of Adelaide links this threat directly to climate change, which has already contributed to a significant loss of reindeer over the last three decades. Using ancient DNA and computer models, scientists found that past periods of rapid warming led to population declines. The projected losses could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and accelerated carbon release from Arctic soils.</p>

The consensus view is that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted and effective tariff rates climb, companies will increasingly pass on the higher costs. While no one is predicting runaway inflation, a steady increase is expected, which could push the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure into the low- to mid-3% range.

          <p>A European Commission proposal to impose penalties on Israel over the humanitarian situation in Gaza has stalled amid divisions among EU member states. The plan, which would bar Israeli startups from accessing certain EU research funds, was proposed two weeks ago but has not advanced due to a lack of consensus, with Germany among the holdouts. The Commission's proposal cited violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Gaza as the reason for the action. This deadlock highlights the bloc's ongoing struggle to form a unified policy response to the conflict, despite escalating warnings of famine in the region.</p>

          <p>A satirical piece from The Atlantic explores the irony of White House advisor Stephen Miller's concerns about crime in Washington, D.C. The article humorously suggests that Miller is indeed surrounded by criminals, but points not to street crime, but to the actions of his colleagues within the Trump administration. It sarcastically references convicted felons, individuals who have defied court orders, and those who have dismantled government agencies as the "lawlessness" Miller encounters daily. The piece uses sharp wit to critique the administration's own conduct while it publicly calls for a law-and-order crackdown in the city.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are mounting a coordinated effort to defend established climate science against a recent Department of Energy report that supports undoing the EPA's "endangerment finding." This finding is the legal foundation for most U.S. climate regulations. In response, the National Academies of Sciences is conducting a "fast-track" review of the latest evidence on greenhouse gases' threat to human health. This pushback comes as researchers work to safeguard scientific data that the administration has reportedly been removing from government websites, highlighting a growing conflict between the scientific community and federal policymakers.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. Previously, the discount on most food items was only available during the holiday season. The move, which the company said was one of its most requested benefits, comes as rising tariffs are expected to lead to higher consumer prices. The expanded perk for its 1.6 million U.S. employees could help them offset the impact of inflation while also encouraging them to spend more at Walmart's own stores.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration is permitted to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress. The divided 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit vacates a lower court's injunction that had previously forced the administration to release the funds. The ruling stated that the grant recipients challenging the president's executive order did not have the legal standing for the court to hear their claims. This decision allows the administration to move forward with freezing funds for global health and HIV/AIDS programs, which it has described as wasteful spending.</p>

          <p>U.S. homeowners are currently sitting on a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, with the average mortgage holder having access to about $213,000. This article explains how homeowners can calculate their available equity to potentially borrow against it using financial tools like home equity loans or HELOCs. The calculation involves subtracting the outstanding mortgage balance from the home's current market value, with lenders typically allowing borrowing up to 80% of the resulting equity. While this presents a significant financial opportunity, homeowners are cautioned to borrow responsibly as the home serves as collateral for the loan. (not investment advice)</p>
