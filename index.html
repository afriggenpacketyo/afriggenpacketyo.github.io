          <h2>UK Nurses to Vote on Proposed Pay Deal Amid Strike Threat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, a move that follows previous strikes over pay disputes. The Royal College of Nursing has criticized the award as insufficient, citing over a decade of pay erosion and a high rate of nurses quitting. The vote is crucial in determining whether further strike action will be pursued, potentially impacting the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England. Ministers maintain the pay rise is the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in the last 10 months, but acknowledge more needs to be done to rebuild the health service. Optimism about the situation is tempered by the ongoing dispute and potential for further disruption.</p>

          <p>ICE officials are initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants at asylum hearings, targeting those residing in the U.S. for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security aims to expedite deportations by encouraging the dismissal of immigration cases, requiring cooperation from immigration judges. Critics argue this approach may deter migrants from attending hearings and primarily targets those without criminal histories beyond illegal entry. Legal analysts note the Supreme Court's ruling supports the expedited removal of migrants in the U.S. for under two years, but immigration attorneys suggest judges could impede the initiative by refusing to dismiss cases.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new proclamation, effective June 9, restricts entry to the U.S. for nationals from 12 countries, citing national security concerns. The ban affects individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and several other nations, regardless of their travel reasons, unless deemed in the national interest by the State Department. Additionally, stricter visa checks are imposed on people from seven other countries, including Burundi and Cuba. The administration argues these countries fail to provide sufficient information on their nationals, while critics suggest political and economic motives are at play, noting exemptions for countries with close business ties to the Trump family.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating weak domestic demand and insufficient stimulus measures.

A price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices are contributing to the downward pressure, despite strong exports.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India's larger-than-expected rate cut is expected to put downward pressure on the rupee by depressing foreign exchange forward premiums. This move narrows the interest rate differential with the U.S., potentially making the rupee less attractive for carry trades. Analysts suggest the decline in premiums could lead to sharper rupee depreciation as it reduces incentives for exporters to hedge receivables and raises hedging activity among importers. While intended to support growth, the rate cut may leave the rupee vulnerable in the face of weak capital flows. (not investment advice)</p>

This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa.

          <p>Polish and allied planes were briefly scrambled in Polish airspace due to Russian aerial strikes targeting Ukraine. The Polish armed forces launched available resources, including fighter pairs and air defense systems, as a preventative measure. The Ukrainian air force had issued alerts about Russian drones targeting areas throughout Ukraine. After approximately three hours, the military announced that the threat had diminished, and the warplanes returned to their usual activity, with no violations of Polish airspace reported.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method considered destructive, across English waters. The proposed extension would increase the prohibited area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 within the UK's offshore protected areas. This move aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, and it follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling. The proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking views from the marine and fishing sectors.</p>
