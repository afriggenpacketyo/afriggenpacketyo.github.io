        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced strong earnings and revenue figures, surpassing analyst estimates, primarily fueled by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company's performance is attributed to high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for developing and deploying AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Nvidia projects $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance is reduced by approximately $8 billion due to recent export restrictions on its H20 chips bound for China. Overall revenue experienced a substantial 69% growth during the quarter, highlighting Nvidia's continued expansion in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations has criticized Israel's new aid program in southern Gaza, following a chaotic launch where thousands of Palestinians rushed a food distribution site, prompting Israeli forces to fire warning shots. This initiative is intended to bypass both the UN and Hamas, but humanitarian groups argue it remains dangerously inadequate. The situation has intensified diplomatic pressure on Israel, with increasing frustration from allies, including the United States, regarding the prolonged conflict and Israel's conduct in Gaza. European diplomats have also voiced concerns, emphasizing that aid should not be politicized or militarized, as the new system replaces numerous UN distribution sites with just four, requiring Palestinians to travel longer distances through Israeli troop cordons to receive aid.</p>

          <p>HP's stock experienced a significant decline of 15% after the company's second-quarter earnings missed analyst expectations, primarily due to the impact of tariffs. While revenue exceeded estimates, earnings per share fell short, and the company's guidance for the third quarter and full year also disappointed. HP attributed the lower outlook to "added cost driven by the current U.S. tariffs," despite efforts to mitigate these costs by expanding manufacturing operations outside of China. The company has increased production in countries like Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico, and the U.S., aiming to shift nearly all North American product manufacturing out of China by the end of June.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price rose sharply despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to an anticipated $50 million hit from tariffs. The company now expects full-year earnings per share to be between $9.50 and $10.50, down from a previous range of $10.40 to $11.40. Despite these challenges, the company's fiscal first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue, leading to the stock's surge. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Abercrombie is working with vendors to offset costs and diversify its sourcing network, with its biggest trading partners now being Vietnam, Cambodia, and India.</p>

Petrova's lawyer argued that the failure to declare the samples would ordinarily be treated as a minor infraction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that June 2025 may be an opportune time to consolidate credit card debt due to several economic factors. Credit card interest rates are expected to remain high, while rates on alternative borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs may decrease. Consolidating debt with a lower-interest loan can help borrowers avoid the compounding interest cycle of credit cards. By consolidating with a HELOC or a debt consolidation personal loan, consumers can potentially save on interest costs and make larger payments toward their principal balance.

          <p>Homeland Security agents are conducting unannounced "wellness checks" on migrant children, stirring fear and criticism from advocates who see the visits as part of the immigration crackdown. These checks, intended to ensure children are enrolled in school and properly cared for, are being carried out by agents from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit that combats drug and weapons smuggling, cybercrimes, and financial crimes. Critics argue that the use of criminal investigators for these checks is a tactic to accelerate deportations and that the involvement of a federal social services agency, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, is troubling.</p>
