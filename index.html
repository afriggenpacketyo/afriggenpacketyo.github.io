          <h2>Reports of Serious Childcare Incidents in English Nurseries on the Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 17:01:08 EDT</div>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed a concerning increase in serious childcare incidents reported by nurseries in England, with over 4,200 reports in 2023-24, a 40% rise from five years prior. These incidents range from injuries and illnesses to accidents and even deaths. Parents of a baby who died at a nursery are advocating for more frequent inspections and CCTV checks, while a former Ofsted inspector criticizes the current inspection system as easily manipulated. The government claims to be introducing stronger safeguarding measures, but experts warn that standards must improve to prevent further harm to children.</p>

          <p>Despite a global stock market sell-off following President Trump's announcement of broad-ranging tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that the administration will not back down.

This stance echoes that of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, indicating a firm commitment to the new trade policies. The tariffs, including a 10% duty on all imported goods and higher levies on imports from 57 countries, are set to take effect, with no plans for postponement.</p>

          <p>Alex Ovechkin surpassed Wayne Gretzky's record for most goals in an NHL career. Ovechkin scored his 895th goal in the second period against the Islanders. Some Canadians feel uneasy about the record belonging to Ovechkin, a supporter of Vladimir Putin. Many Canadians feel the record had already slipped away due to Gretzky's support of Donald Trump. Gretzky appears to have spent more time at Mar-a-Lago than in Canada lately. </p>
