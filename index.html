            <p>Eddy Massaad, CEO of Swiss Butter, credits the brand's growth to its resilience following the Beirut blast tragedy in 2020, where the restaurant reopened just 30 days after being destroyed. Massaad emphasizes the Lebanese ability to overcome challenges pragmatically. The brand's expansion began in late 2021, with plans to reach 100 locations within five years, driven by its viral steak frites sauce. The "secret" sauce, crafted by Massaad's brother, contains 33 ingredients, becoming a hallmark of the dining experience, capitalizing on the revival of comfort food with premium execution.</p>

            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish a commission to explore altering the state's border with Illinois, reflecting interest from some Illinois counties to separate from the Chicago area. While Indiana's government supports the idea, Illinois officials have dismissed it as a "stunt." This effort is driven by political divisions, with the Chicago area controlled by Democrats and the rest of Illinois represented by Republicans. Similar efforts are underway in eastern Oregon, where some counties seek to join Idaho, highlighting growing political fragmentation within states.</p>
