          <p>U.S. applications for unemployment benefits remained unchanged last week, indicating that layoffs remain low despite economic uncertainties related to President Trump's tariffs. The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid was 229,000 for the week ending May 10, aligning with analysts' forecasts. Weekly applications are viewed as a reliable indicator of U.S. layoffs and have largely remained within a healthy range since the COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of May 3 rose by 9,000 to 1.88 million, reflecting a stable labor market.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced his disapproval to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding the company's plans to increase production in India. Trump referenced Apple's $500 billion investment in the U.S. and stated he wants Apple to build in the United States, not India. Apple has been increasing its production in India, aiming to manufacture around 25% of its global iPhones there to reduce its reliance on China, where approximately 90% of its smartphones are currently assembled. Trump emphasized that the U.S. has accommodated Apple's plants in China for years and now expects the company to prioritize building in America.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that homeownership is becoming increasingly unattainable for middle-class families in the U.S. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach, with the median sale price in the first quarter of 2025 near $420,000. The lack of affordable homes is attributed to a construction slowdown following the 2006 housing crisis, with the worst affordability gaps found in cities with restrictive zoning and permitting regulations.</p>

          <p>Analysts caution that despite the recent agreement between the U.S. and China to pause tariff increases, long-term confrontations are likely to persist. The agreement, which involves rolling back tariffs on each other's goods by 115%, is seen by some observers as a validation of Beijing's strategy against economic pressure. Experts suggest that the 90-day truce will not eliminate the underlying structural divides in bilateral ties, urging preparations to address ongoing sticking points. One analyst noted that China's firm stance was crucial to achieving this outcome, but warned against harboring illusions, as Trump's combative approach remains a significant risk.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta it purchased for $27.50 in 1946 is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions.

The Magna Carta, originally ratified by King John in 1215, is considered a foundation of modern democracy. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to Appleby in Westmorland, England, highlighting its historical significance.</p>

Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, with the era of near-zero rates unlikely to return soon. He indicated that more frequent and persistent supply shocks could pose a challenge for central banks, requiring a delicate balance between supporting employment and controlling inflation.

          <p>A planned round of Ukraine peace talks in Turkey encountered setbacks as Ukrainian and Russian delegations arrived in separate cities, casting doubt on whether they would meet. President Putin did not attend, sending midlevel officials to Istanbul, while President Zelenskyy met with the Turkish president in Ankara. The situation was further complicated by President Trump's statement that progress would require a meeting between him and Putin. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about the Russian delegation's ability to make independent decisions, underscoring the challenges in achieving a meaningful resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Walmart executives announced that the company will have to start raising prices later this month due to the high cost of tariffs. CFO John David Rainey indicated that U.S. shoppers will see prices rise at the end of May and certainly in June. CEO Doug McMillon stated that Walmart will do its best to keep prices as low as possible, but the magnitude of the tariffs makes it impossible to absorb all the pressure. The retailer avoided giving second-quarter profit guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, which have roiled world trade.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, especially in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs may soon force the company to raise prices. Sales at U.S. stores rose more than 3 percent, and e-commerce sales jumped over 20 percent. While the company maintained its full-year financial forecast, executives noted that tariffs are weighing on the company and may lead to higher prices for shoppers. CEO Doug McMillon emphasized that domestic production is helpful in navigating tariffs, but acknowledged that higher tariffs will inevitably result in higher prices for some items.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether federal judges can block Trump administration policy across the country, a practice that has significantly impeded the President's agenda. The dispute stems from an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which was promptly blocked by federal judges. A ruling that limits nationwide injunctions could reshape how federal courts handle challenges to Trump's policies, potentially curbing judicial power and boosting executive authority. The case marks the first time since Trump returned to office that the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments stemming from one of his policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird living in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that federal officials erred in listing the prairie-chicken under the Act. This move is viewed as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, given the bird's habitat overlaps with drilling areas. Critics argue that delisting the bird would signal that no endangered species is safe, especially those living where fossil fuels are buried. The lesser prairie-chicken population has drastically declined due to habitat loss from energy development, farming, and housing.</p>
