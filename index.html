          <p>North Korea has criticized the United States' plan for a futuristic "Golden Dome" missile shield, stating it could potentially turn outer space into a nuclear war field. Pyongyang's foreign ministry condemned the plan as the height of self-righteousness and arrogance, warning it might spark a global nuclear and space arms race. The defense system, intended to counter next-generation aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles, is seen by North Korea as a threat that could significantly weaken its nuclear arsenal. China has also voiced concerns, stating the Golden Dome has strong offensive implications and undermines global strategic balance.</p>

          <p>Garment manufacturers in China and Vietnam experienced a small sense of relief after US President Donald Trump indicated that the United States was not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts. However, businesses are not altering their strategies based on these comments, as they have learned that Trump's policies can change rapidly. Despite a 90-day pause in US tariffs, uncertainty remains high, and both countries are seeking a deal with Washington to prevent further increases in duties. Vietnam's textile exporters are now focusing on diversifying their markets to mitigate the impact of potential trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>A former federal prison warden described the security protocols at the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility as deficient, contributing to the escape of ten inmates, including a serial escape artist. The jail had been deemed a "train wreck" in terms of basic operations, with inadequate inmate supervision leading to violence, drug use, and weapon creation. The latest compliance check report highlighted failures in security inspections and a lack of monitoring systems to verify that security checks were taking place. One of the escapees, Antoine Massey, had escaped from custody three times previously, raising questions about the jail's handling of high-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has issued a warning to its citizens in Bangladesh against "buying a foreign wife" due to growing reports of marriage scams and human trafficking. The Chinese embassy in Dhaka urged citizens not to be misled by social media posts offering quick marriages abroad, stating that international matchmaking services are illegal under Chinese law. This warning comes amid a reported surplus of 35 million men in China who are unable to find brides, leading some to seek partners from other nations.

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to support businesses and households adversely affected by U.S. tariffs. The funds will bolster the finances of small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs. This action comes as Japan faces an expected economic slowdown due to U.S. levies, public anger over higher consumer prices, and pressure to reduce government debt. President Trump has paused a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods until early July, but the automotive sector is already reeling from a 25 percent U.S. tariff on finished automobiles and car parts.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Challenge Darwinism with Study on Acquired Traits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have challenged Darwinian evolution by proving that acquired traits can shape heredity without DNA changes. A study published in Cell showed that rice plants subjected to cold stress passed on an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures across five generations, bypassing genetic mutations. This research revives the 19th-century theory of Lamarck, suggesting that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The team, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pinpointed heritable DNA methylation changes as the driver of cold adaptation in crops, positioning Lamarckism as a potent force in evolution.</p>

The underlying issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, a problem that has existed for decades.
