            <p>Hashem Abedi, serving a life sentence for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, causing life-threatening injuries.

            <p>Albert Saniger, former CEO of fintech startup nate, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding investors by falsely claiming the company's app was powered by AI. Prosecutors allege that nate's e-commerce app, which promised to streamline online shopping, actually relied on overseas workers manually processing transactions. Saniger raised over $40 million based on these false claims, leaving investors with near-total losses after the company's collapse in 2023. This case highlights the growing scrutiny of AI claims and the potential for abuse in the rapidly expanding AI investment market.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are expected to disproportionately impact low-income Americans by raising prices on everyday goods and increasing the risk of an economic recession. Tariffs act as a consumption tax, placing a greater burden on lower-income households, who spend a larger percentage of their disposable income on essential items. A recession resulting from the tariffs could lead to job losses and reduced wages, further exacerbating economic inequality. While some argue tariffs can benefit certain industries, Trump's broad approach is likely to harm vulnerable populations.</p>

            <p>Devastating attacks on camps in Darfur, Sudan, housing hundreds of thousands displaced by the civil war, have resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including children and aid workers. The attacks, blamed on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have targeted Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, exacerbating the dire humanitarian crisis. These camps already face famine-like conditions. The UN and US State Department have condemned the violence, which marks a significant escalation in the conflict.</p>

            <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's trade policies are not a unique moment, but rather a symptom of deeper issues within globalized, free-market capitalism. While Trump's actions have caused economic damage and international condemnation, the forces underpinning his political project have been long in the making. The article highlights the negative impacts of globalization on working-class populations in Western economies and the need for international collaboration to address these shortcomings.</p>

            <p>Following the government's takeover of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, the business secretary declined to guarantee the plant's continued operation. Emergency legislation was passed to prevent the Chinese-owned company from shutting down its blast furnaces. The government intervened after the owners rejected financial support and appeared intent on closing the plant, which is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The government is seeking a buyer for British Steel, but the takeover is expected to cost taxpayers.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the rise of "end times fascism," a blend of corporate city-states, mass-market bunker nations, and religious fundamentalism, driven by a belief in an impending apocalypse. It argues that this ideology is characterized by a desire to escape the world's problems rather than solve them, and by a willingness to sacrifice certain groups for the survival of the chosen few. The article urges resistance to this ideology and a commitment to building a more just and sustainable future.</p>
