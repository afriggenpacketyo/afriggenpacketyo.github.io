          <p>Following a significant 336-run defeat to India at Edgbaston, this article analyzes the recurring problems plaguing Ben Stokes' England Test cricket team. Despite moments of brilliance, the team struggles with consistency, often following major wins with heavy losses. Key issues highlighted include the inconsistent batting performances of players like Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley, the high cost of runs conceded by spinner Shoaib Bashir, and the heavy workload on the pace bowlers. These challenges prevent the team from achieving its goal of becoming a top-ranked side.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges he faced, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, which could have resulted in a life sentence. Combs was, however, convicted on lesser prostitution-related charges and remains in custody pending sentencing. His defense team successfully argued that while Combs was a flawed individual and a domestic abuser, his actions did not constitute sex trafficking. According to his lawyer, Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon returning to his cell after the verdict.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed his first-ever home victory at a chaotic, rain-soaked British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Norris took the lead after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, was handed a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety car restart. The win, celebrated emotionally by Norris in front of a record crowd, narrows the gap in the drivers' championship between him and Piastri. The race featured multiple incidents and safety cars, with Nico Hulkenberg securing a surprise third-place podium finish for Sauber.</p>

          <p>A senior Hamas security officer has claimed that the group has lost control over approximately 80% of the Gaza Strip, with its command structure collapsing under months of Israeli military pressure. In voice messages shared with the BBC, the anonymous lieutenant colonel described a near-total breakdown of security, leading to a power vacuum being filled by armed clans and criminal gangs. He stated that most of the group's leadership has been killed, making it difficult to govern or provide basic services.</p>

          <p>Two years after a Land Rover crashed into an end-of-term tea party at a London school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls killed, Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau, say they are still waiting for answers. At a memorial event, the families expressed their commitment to uncovering the truth about the incident. The driver, who claimed to have no memory of the event, was initially not charged after it was determined she had an epileptic seizure. The police investigation was reopened in January, and the families are dismayed by the prolonged wait for accountability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported eight men, most of whom are not South Sudanese nationals, to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle. The men, convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were sent to the third-party country after their home nations reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that would have granted the men due process hearings. This action is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand deportations to third countries, even those considered unstable.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) has condemned an attack on a Deutsche Welle (DW) news crew by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The correspondent and cameraman, who were wearing marked press jackets, were chased and had stones thrown at them while covering a protest against settler violence. While the journalists were unharmed, their vehicle was badly damaged. DW's Director General and Germany's ambassador to Israel have both called for the Israeli government to guarantee the safety of journalists.</p>
