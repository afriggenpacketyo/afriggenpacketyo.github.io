          <p>A Minnesota softball player, M.S., is suing the state over its policy allowing trans-identifying male athletes to compete in girls' sports, arguing it violates Title IX. M.S. left her club team after being forced to compete with a male athlete, Marissa Rothenberger, who identifies as a girl. The lawsuit, filed by Alliance Defending Freedom on behalf of Female Athletes United, claims Minnesota's policy denies female athletes equal opportunities and puts them at safety risks. The legal counsel emphasizes the physiological differences between males and females, arguing for policies that protect a dedicated category for female athletes. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, has returned to the United States to face charges related to an alleged undocumented migrant smuggling ring, months after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, who had a 2019 withholding order preventing his removal to El Salvador, was deported in March, which the Trump administration later admitted was an error. He is now indicted in federal court for allegedly conspiring to transport undocumented migrants within the United States over a nine-year period. His attorney claims the charges are an abuse of power, while the Trump administration alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, which he denies.</p>

          <p>A public feud has erupted between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Musk, who previously headed the Department of Government Efficiency, called the bill a "disgusting abomination," leading to Trump suggesting an end to Musk's government contracts. While Musk showed some signs of softening his tone, Trump told ABC News that Musk was a "man who has lost his mind" and that he was "not particularly" interested in talking to him right now. The spat highlights the growing tensions between the two figures after a period of collaboration.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily lifted an injunction, allowing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access sensitive information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) while legal proceedings continue. This decision permits DOGE, previously led by Elon Musk, to access agency records containing personal information of millions of Americans, including Social Security numbers, medical information, and financial data. A lower court had previously limited DOGE's access due to concerns about privacy violations, but the Supreme Court concluded that SSA may proceed with affording the team access to the agency records in question. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented from the unsigned order.</p>

Mark Dybul, the principal architect of PEPFAR, expressed concern that these cuts could reverse the significant gains made in combating HIV/AIDS.

          <p>Senior U.S. administration officials will meet with a Chinese delegation in London next week for trade negotiations, following a "very positive" phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. side. The talks aim to break an impasse over tariffs and global supplies of rare earth minerals. The Chinese foreign ministry said Xi asked Trump to "remove the negative measures" that the U.S. has taken against China.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to enhance the detection and identification of drones and to counter unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling. This initiative is particularly prioritized due to upcoming large-scale events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to boost U.S. development of drones and commercial use of the technology for deliveries and other purposes.</p>

          <p>Amazon is investing in automating its logistics, potentially saving billions by deploying AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries. These robots would transport packages directly from Rivian electric vans to customers' doors, reducing delivery times and labor costs.

Analysts project that increased automation could lead to significant annual savings by 2030, with Amazon's retail business poised to benefit from generative AI. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is simply better at launching massive numbers of objects into space than any of its competitors, and itâ€™s not close: SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket was responsible for 84 percent of all satellite launches last year, and the constellation of more than 7,000 Starlink communications satellites accounts for around 65 percent of all operational satellites in orbit.

Additionally, Flowers expresses concern that the bulk of available positions are concentrated in health care, leisure, hospitality, and social assistance, sectors that could be vulnerable to policy changes and tariff impacts.
