          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flight delays on Monday due to a shortage in air traffic control staffing, according to a New York Times article. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory delaying incoming flights from all U.S. airports and some in Canada by over an hour and 40 minutes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to slow flights at the airport to address recent delays caused by limited staffing, software and hardware problems, and runway construction. The Trump administration had promised to install new fiber-optic cables to improve data transmission, but Duffy criticized the Biden administration for allegedly mishandling the move of the air traffic control facility to Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was denied over $600,000 in public matching funds after the New York City Campaign Finance Board determined he likely coordinated ad language with a super PAC, according to a New York Times article. The board found that Cuomo's campaign website posting detailed spending instructions resembled a set of instructions for anyone hoping to help, and the super PAC, Fix the City, began airing an ad just days later that appeared to align with some of those requests, echoing themes and data points. Despite the penalty, Cuomo still received $1.5 million in public matching funds and leads in polls ahead of the June 24 primary, despite previous ethics issues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's willingness to accept a lavish jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar has ignited criticism over the legalities of what would mark the largest foreign gift ever received by the U.S. government. Trump is preparing to accept a Boeing 747-8 which he will then use as Air Force One, four sources familiar with the plan told NBC News. Democratic lawmakers and Trump allies have sharply criticized the reported move, saying the lavish nature of the gift raises serious legal and ethical concerns. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar's Media Attaché, told CNBC that any reports that the jet would be gifted during the trip were inaccurate.</p>

All month long, astronomy fans may be able to spot Venus and Saturn low in the eastern sky each morning.

Nakamoto, led by Bailey as CEO, will focus on acquiring and holding bitcoin — a strategy that has become popular among investment firms seeking to turn their stock into a direct bet on the cryptocurrency's price. Bailey said his team was searching for "the right vehicle" to take Nakamoto public, and KindlyMD's leadership team was already full of bitcoin enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, the countries said in a joint statement shared by the White House, heralding significant success in trade negotiations that ramped up over the weekend. Both parties committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to give the negotiations room to move forward. China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers, potentially including resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers.</p>

India, blaming the April 22 attack on Pakistan’s history of sheltering terrorist groups, launched airstrikes across the border, with Pakistan responding in kind. The clashes quickly escalated, with both countries hitting deeper into each other’s territory than at any time in the last 50 years. On Saturday, President Trump announced that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of American mediators and, as the first full day of the fragile truce appeared to hold on Sunday, congratulated them for halting the aggression.</p>

          <p>President Trump angrily brushed off ethical concerns about accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to be used as a new Air Force One, saying only someone “stupid” would turn down such an offer, according to a New York Times article. Mr. Trump said that the gift from Qatar will be to the U.S. Department of Defense — and not him personally — and he said he would not use it after he left office. The plane is to be decommissioned from military use and then turned over to his eventual presidential library, Mr. Trump said. He grew angry at questions of an ethical quagmire, including whether Qatar expected anything in exchange for the donation of the jetliner.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department has spent more than $21 million on flights to Guantanamo Bay amid the Trump administration's migrant deportation efforts, according to data sent to Congress by the Defense Department. In January, President Trump directed his administration to use the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a holding site for migrants, where he said the highest priority, "worst" offenders would be held as part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration. In February, the administration transferred Venezuelan migrants to the facility, before they were taken to Honduras.</p>
