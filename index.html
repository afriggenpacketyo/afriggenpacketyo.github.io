          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth stated that President Trump has "essentially just declared war" on Chicago with his recent rhetoric and social media posts. Speaking on "Face the Nation," she clarified that despite the President's inflammatory language, there are no current indications of military troops being prepared for deployment to the city. Duckworth emphasized that an order to deploy the military against a U.S. city would be illegal and noted the administration's lack of coordination with local law enforcement, suggesting the threats are political theater rather than a genuine effort to combat crime.</p>

CEO Neil Kiefer, who aims to reclaim the original 1980s "athletic" dolphin-short style, shifting away from the more sexualized look that became prevalent. This change comes as the original Hooters group plans to take over locations previously operated by Hooters of America, which filed for bankruptcy, in an effort to make the chain more approachable for families and a wider customer base.</p>

          <p>Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the Americas, has died, leaving behind a legacy of reform and a focus on social justice. From the moment of his election in 2013, he signaled a new direction for the Catholic Church, emphasizing humility, compassion for the poor, and a more welcoming tone towards marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals. His papacy was defined by his critiques of global financial systems and climate change, and while he faced criticism from conservatives, his charisma and progressive stance created a "Francis effect" that rejuvenated faith for many worldwide.</p>

          <p>Legendary fashion designer Giorgio Armani, renowned for his vision of relaxed elegance and for blurring the lines between menswear and womenswear, has died. Rising from a department store job, he co-founded his company in 1975 and quickly put Italian ready-to-wear fashion on the global map with his revolutionary women's pantsuit and unlined men's jacket. Despite personal loss and a perfectionist nature, Armani built his brand into a multi-billion dollar empire that extended far beyond clothing into cosmetics, restaurants, and home design, leaving an indelible mark on style.</p>

Several of the newly debuted missile systems are reported to have the range to reach the continental United States. The display reflects the rapid pace of China's military modernization, which is being driven by a competitive ecosystem of both state-owned and private companies that are fostering innovation in areas like unmanned aerial vehicles and long-range strike capabilities.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 890 people at a demonstration opposing the UK government's decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The majority of arrests were for supporting a banned organization, with police also reporting 17 arrests for assaults on officers. Organizers of the rally in Parliament Square stated that protesters were peacefully defying what they see as an unjust ban, accusing the police of using violence and making false claims to justify the mass arrests.</p>

          <p>Russia has unleashed the largest single aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, launching over 800 drones and missiles across the country. In Kyiv, the attack killed at least two people and caused significant damage to the cabinet of ministers building, a major escalation that has previously spared central government offices. President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate crime and made an urgent plea for more advanced air defense systems to protect civilians from what he termed "vile strikes."</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States has found a consistent pattern of couples sharing the same psychiatric diagnoses. This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," was observed for disorders like depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and has remained stable across different cultures and generations for over half a century. Researchers theorize that individuals with similar mental health challenges may be drawn to each other due to shared understanding, similar environments, or perceived limited dating prospects.</p>

          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in the game's history, an estimated $1.8 billion, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. The winning numbers were drawn on Sunday, ending a three-month streak of 41 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. The massive jackpot had generated significant public interest and ticket sales across the country. The winners will now have the choice between receiving their share of the prize as a lump-sum cash payment or as an annuity paid out over 29 years.</p>

          <p>The natural meandering of the Amazon River is threatening to leave Colombia's only port town, Leticia, landlocked, which is escalating a border dispute with Peru. As drought and sedimentation push the river's main channel south into Peruvian territory, concerns are growing in Colombia about losing vital river access for trade and supplies. This environmental shift has reignited a long-standing territorial conflict over Santa Rosa, a river island now at the center of competing sovereignty claims between the two nations.</p>

The defense contends their actions were a necessary humanitarian response to save lives, as the family was starving and had been illegally pushed back into Belarus by border guards, highlighting the severe consequences of Europe's stringent border enforcement.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is the most critical foundation parents can provide for their children's long-term health and success. Consistent, deep sleep is vital for a baby's physical, cognitive, and emotional development, and good habits formed early can lead to better learning, concentration, and resilience later in life. He advises parents to create a soothing environment, involve both caretakers in settling the baby, and maintain a flexible routine to teach infants to sleep soundly.</p>

          <p>This article argues that solar energy, often associated with left-leaning environmentalism, should be embraced by right-wing preppers as the most logical choice for self-sufficiency. It contrasts the simplicity, longevity, and independence of a personal solar panel and battery system with the complex, failure-prone, and interdependent infrastructure required for fossil fuels. By providing a truly off-grid power source, solar energy aligns perfectly with the conservative ideals of individualism and resilience in the face of potential societal breakdown.</p>

The complaint stems from Ortiz resharing an Instagram post that warned of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity near an elementary school.
