          <p>Six individuals were hospitalized, one seriously, after an attack at a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" during the assault, which involved a "makeshift flamethrower" and an incendiary device. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology. The attack occurred on the eve of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday, prompting condemnation from officials, including President Trump, who described the incident as a "heinous act of terror." The Run for Their Lives organization, which hosted the demonstration, has canceled all upcoming events. The incident has sparked outrage and condemnation as an "unspeakable" act of antisemitism, with officials saying the suspect shouted "free, free Palestine" following the shooting. The optimism score is not directly related to the content of this summary. </p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado fears a new wave of repression from NicolÃ¡s Maduro's regime following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in the country. Machado, currently in hiding, cites the arrest of over 70 activists and leaders prior to recent legislative elections as evidence of escalating government control. She views the partial revocation of Chevron's license as a positive step, limiting resources available to the regime during a potential democratic transition. Machado believes Maduro's regime is increasingly isolated and faces an unsustainable economic crisis, exacerbated by declining oil revenues and minimal support from traditional allies. </p>

          <p>A report by Universities UK warns that students may face subject "cold spots" due to university course cuts, particularly if institutions cannot collaborate more effectively. Financial pressures, including a drop in international students and rising inflation, are straining university budgets, leading to course closures and job losses. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) acknowledges the financial challenges and supports collaboration where possible, but existing laws designed to promote competition limit universities' ability to coordinate course offerings. The government is reviewing higher education funding in England, with the aim of restoring universities as engines of opportunity and growth. </p>

          <p>Crystal McKinney, who previously accused Sean "Diddy" Combs of sexual assault, has filed an amended lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, alleging he sexually assaulted her and a friend in 2003. Weinstein's lawyer denies the claims, suggesting they are opportunistic and timed suspiciously after McKinney's lawsuit against Combs. The lawsuit details allegations of coercion, drugging, and sexual assault. McKinney claims her modeling career suffered after the alleged assault by Combs, leading to emotional trauma and addiction. </p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing and returning her pardon issued by President Trump. Hemphill believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine the justice system. She is working with her Republican senator to formally refuse the pardon. Hemphill's actions contrast with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought and celebrated their pardons. </p>

The Ministry of Defence maintains that Williams' pension reflects his full and correct entitlement. Williams, who served 18 years in the navy, was offered redundancy under a program where the navy agreed to add time to his service record so that he received a military pension in addition to the state pension. </p>

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that President Trump's unpredictable policies and actions are creating a "Trump discount" on the stock market, hindering the performance of various sectors. He suggests that the lack of stability and consistency stemming from the White House is driving investors to seek opportunities elsewhere, even in regions with less robust economies. Cramer highlights the impact on specific industries, including technology, retail, pharmaceuticals, and energy, noting that the president's actions often contradict traditional Republican stances and create uncertainty for businesses. The unpredictable nature of the administration is making it difficult for companies to plan and execute mergers and acquisitions, further contributing to the discount. (not investment advice)</p>
