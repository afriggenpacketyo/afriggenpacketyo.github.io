          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey reveals that a significant majority of economists and fund managers believe President Trump's actions are undermining the Federal Reserve's independence. Respondents predict these pressures will likely lead to negative economic outcomes, including weaker growth, higher inflation, and increased unemployment. While the Fed is expected to cut rates, there is considerable disagreement on the proper course of action, with recession probabilities rising to 40% amid concerns over tariffs and administration policy.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals have been fired or disciplined by their employers for public comments about the event. Companies including MSNBC, United Airlines, and Nasdaq have terminated employees, citing violations of workplace policies and potential harm to their reputations. Legal experts note that private employers generally have the right to fire workers for public statements, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector, especially for at-will employees.</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the Southport dance studio attack has revealed significant systemic failures in handling the killer, Axel Rudakubana, prior to the murders. Evidence showed a teacher expressed frustration over "frightening red tape" that prevented police, social services, and mental health interventions despite his history of violence and obsession with weapons. The inquiry is examining why multiple agencies, including counter-terrorism units, failed to coordinate or take ownership of his case, potentially missing opportunities to prevent the tragedy where three young girls were killed.</p>

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's willingness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that the administration prioritized national security over the deal itself, which he believes "turned the tide" in negotiations. The commercial terms of the deal between parent company ByteDance and new investors have reportedly been settled for months, with a final agreement expected to be formalized soon.</p>

          <p>The article recounts Europe's surprising 1995 Ryder Cup victory at Oak Hill, one of only four times they have won on American soil. Led by captain Bernard Gallacher, the underdog European team overcame internal selection disputes and a day-one deficit to stage a dramatic Sunday comeback. Key moments, including Philip Walton securing the final point and Nick Faldo's pivotal win over Curtis Strange, cemented the event as a memorable upset in Ryder Cup history, which was broadcast live by Sky Sports for the first time.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a large-scale ground offensive on Gaza City, which it describes as the last major stronghold for Hamas. The operation began with heavy overnight airstrikes, forcing thousands of Palestinian civilians to flee south along a single designated coastal road, adding to the hundreds of thousands already displaced. The assault has drawn sharp international condemnation, with humanitarian organizations warning of a deepening catastrophe as the city faces intense bombardment and a worsening famine.</p>
