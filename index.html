            <p>A nine-year-old boy tragically died after being trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach, contributing to a total of seven drowning deaths across Australia during the Easter weekend. The majority of these fatalities were attributed to strong swells sweeping individuals off rocks into the ocean. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described it as the "worst" spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend, marking a somber occasion for the region. Two people remain missing amidst the ongoing search and rescue operations.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has predictably kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision reflects the PBOC's focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and better-than-expected economic data. By maintaining steady rates, the PBOC aims to balance economic growth with currency stability, navigating the complexities of international trade relations and domestic economic performance.

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has proposed a controversial prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelan migrants deported from the U.S. and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for the release of an equal number of "political prisoners" held by the Maduro regime. Bukele directly addressed President Maduro on social media, listing names of imprisoned opposition figures and activists. Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, criticized the proposal, questioning the legality of the Venezuelans' imprisonment and accusing El Salvador of human rights violations. The US Supreme Court recently halted the deportation of another group of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties.</p>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a controversial site viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism, as the shrine commenced its three-day spring festival. Despite sending the offering, Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine personally, likely due to ongoing diplomatic sensitivities with China and South Korea. Cabinet ministers Takamaro Fukuoka and Minoru Kiuchi also sent offerings. Ishiba has expressed readiness to re-examine the reasons behind Japan's involvement in World War II, though he is not expected to issue a formal statement on the 80th anniversary of the war's end.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate hundreds of Venezuelans deported from the United States in exchange for political prisoners. Bukele directed his offer to Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, stating that unlike the detainees in El Salvador, Venezuela's political prisoners have committed no crime. The US and El Salvador claim that most of the deportees are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Venezuela's Attorney General has requested information on the Venezuelans in El Salvador and accused the government of breaching their human rights.</p>

            <p>An analysis of the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us" reveals a shift in focus from building bonds to exploring their fracturing in impossible circumstances, and the show is more about how bonds can fracture. The season's plot detours, particularly those depicting Joel's death, feel awkwardly inserted, diminishing the emotional impact. The show presents examples of undiluted pain, deviating from the game's careful observation of animosity. Despite glimmers of ingenuity, the show's limited imagination and unrelenting cheerlessness make it a punishing watch.</p>

            <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing renewed calls for his dismissal after being linked to a second group chat about sensitive military operations, reportedly shared with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.

            <p>China is increasingly turning to the sports industry to stimulate consumption and drive growth amid a challenging economic landscape. Shanghai welcomed a record-high 220,000 spectators for the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, projected to bring over 5 billion yuan in economic benefits. Local policymakers are betting on the sports sector as traditional growth drivers, such as real estate, decline. While the central government has rolled out supportive measures, local authorities are integrating sports with other fields to boost economic activity.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for a Chinese airline has been returned to the planemaker’s US production hub due to tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. The jet, destined for Xiamen Airlines, landed back in Seattle after making refueling stops. Trump recently raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, while China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods. The high tariffs make it financially unviable for Chinese airlines to take delivery of new Boeing jets. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries uncertain.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece discusses how China might respond to escalating trade tensions with the United States under President Trump. The author suggests that China may use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact of tariffs but ultimately needs to resolve its own economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. Rather than focusing solely on trade rebalancing, the US is attempting to systematically strangle China’s economic rise by imposing increasingly strict export controls, particularly on advanced technology. The author concludes that China is digging in for a long fight.</p>

While same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Japan, friendship marriages offer a "desperate measure" for those seeking partnership outside traditional norms, highlighting evolving values and the need for diverse relationship options.</p>

Societal expectations of masculinity, such as self-reliance and not showing vulnerability, contribute to this reluctance.
