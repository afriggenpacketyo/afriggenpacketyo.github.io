          <p>House Republicans are facing significant challenges in securing enough votes to pass President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, which includes substantial tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense. A crucial procedural vote was underway, but a handful of GOP holdouts, including both moderates and conservatives, are threatening its final passage due to concerns over Senate changes to the legislation. President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson are intensely pressuring members to support the bill, aiming to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has admitted to a failure in properly engaging with Labour MPs, leading to a series of damaging U-turns on the government's flagship welfare reforms, particularly concerning Personal Independence Payment (Pip).

Starmer took responsibility for the chaotic episode, acknowledging that the process was not handled correctly.

          <p>Senior UN officials have issued a grave warning that gangs have achieved "near-total control" of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, with their influence expanding into previously peaceful regions. The state's authority is rapidly diminishing, leading to criminal groups establishing parallel governance structures and paralyzing legal commerce, causing soaring prices for essential goods. The UN Assistant Secretary-General emphasized that without increased international intervention, a total collapse of state presence in the capital is a very real scenario. This dire situation is exacerbated by an understaffed UN-backed mission and a significant increase in sexual violence and extrajudicial killings by various groups.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital market is witnessing a remarkable resurgence, with initial public offering (IPO) volumes reaching their strongest first half-year since 2021, fueled by a rush of Chinese companies seeking listings. This surge is attributed to Beijing's supportive regulatory policies, a slower pace of A-share listings, abundant market liquidity, and concerns over potential delistings from U.S. exchanges. The trend of dual-listing (A-then-H shares) is particularly prominent, as Chinese firms utilize Hong Kong's more fungible currency for their global expansion strategies. This revitalized activity positions Hong Kong to become the world's leading listing destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska is urging House GOP support for President Trump's sweeping spending bill, despite acknowledging concerns over Senate-mandated changes to Medicaid provisions. Bacon emphasized that voting against the bill would effectively raise income taxes for Americans, citing an estimated $1,700 annual increase for middle-class families in Nebraska. While he believes the House's original bill was superior, he defends the current version's core changes, which primarily focus on work requirements for able-bodied adults. The bill, which passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote, continues to face opposition from various Republican factions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's policy that restricts migrants crossing the southern border from seeking asylum, ruling that the President exceeded his legal authority. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and Nationality Act grant the President unilateral power to limit asylum rights. The decision, which granted a class action for all affected individuals, has been stayed for 14 days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.

Powell, whose term extends until May 2026, has previously stated he would not step down if asked, asserting that the White House lacks the legal authority to force his removal.

While a new information-sharing process has since been agreed upon with police, the previous delays severely impacted operations like Green Jacket and Bernese.
