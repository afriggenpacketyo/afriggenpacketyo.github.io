        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple B-2 stealth bombers are being deployed to Guam, though they currently have no further orders. The move comes as tensions escalate between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program, and the Trump administration is considering its options. Speculation has grown regarding the potential use of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator to target Iran’s underground uranium enrichment facility. The B-2 is the only U.S. Air Force bomber capable of carrying the MOP, and the bombers could remain at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam for an extended period. Optimism is somewhat tempered by the heightened tensions and the potential for military action.</p>

          <p>A member of Palestine Action has criticized the government's plan to proscribe the group, effectively branding it as a terrorist organization, calling the move "absurd" and a threat to British democracy. This follows an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed planes with red paint, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called "disgraceful." The government is launching a security review at military bases across the UK in response. The group claims its actions are aimed at disrupting the supply chain to what they call "genocide," referring to Israel's actions in Gaza, while Israel strongly denies these allegations. The potential banning of the group raises concerns about the use of counter-terrorism powers against protests.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old newlywed, has been detained by ICE since February after returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Sakeik, whose family is from Gaza but is legally stateless, has lived in the U.S. since she was 8 under an "order of supervision," requiring regular check-ins with immigration authorities. Despite assurances before her trip, she was detained at the airport and now faces deportation, with an attempted deportation occurring just hours before Israel launched airstrikes on Iran. Her husband, a U.S. citizen, is desperately trying to prevent her deportation, highlighting the procedural challenges she faces due to her stateless status and past denied asylum claim.</p>

Analysts believe this move indicates the U.S. commitment to its security obligations despite President Trump’s transactional approach to allies in the region. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force’s flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, one of the U.S. Air Force’s largest annual air combat drills. The exercise involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the US, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and other countries.</p>

While the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, some Democrats express concerns about the party's direction and fundraising capabilities.

The Minister for Economic Development warned that the economy is teetering on the brink of recession, and the Central Bank Governor noted that unused resources have been exhausted.

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison after five years, along with 13 other political prisoners. He has been reunited with his wife in Lithuania, following a meeting between US special envoy Keith Kellogg and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovskaya expressed her joy at her husband's release, which came as a surprise. While this is a significant development, hundreds of other political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus.</p>

          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to potential undeclared milk allergens. The recall includes six lots of semi-sweet chocolate with "Christmas Seeds" colored nonpareils and 15 lots of semi-sweet chocolate with white nonpareils. The FDA warns that individuals with milk allergies or sensitivities risk serious allergic reactions if they consume the affected products. The issue was discovered after a customer complaint and subsequent lab testing confirmed the presence of milk.</p>

He timed his run perfectly and fired past the goalkeeper, demonstrating a knack for arriving late in the box, similar to his sibling. The former Sunderland midfielder has been working on this skill, and it capped a fine display on his full debut.</p>
