          <p>A whistleblower complaint has triggered a state and local investigation into the King County Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention near Seattle, alleging the department hired over 100 corrections officers who did not meet legal immigration requirements. According to the complaint, some guards were hired with temporary or expired work visas, in direct violation of Washington state law, which requires peace officers to be citizens, permanent residents, or DACA recipients. While the department denies hiring any illegal immigrants, it acknowledged a potential oversight in applying state statutes and stated it is taking the matter seriously and cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Amid rising threats against the U.S. judiciary, prominent MAGA figures and El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, are publicly encouraging the Trump administration to crack down on judges perceived as political opponents. Bukele, who has previously dismissed judges in his own country, called for the impeachment of "corrupt judges" in the U.S., a sentiment echoed by figures like Elon Musk. This rhetoric coincides with a documented surge in threats against federal and local judges, with experts warning that such attacks from senior political figures are part of an authoritarian strategy to undermine judicial independence and democratic accountability.</p>

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, Florida's Chief Financial Officer and a Ron DeSantis loyalist, is facing criticism after his initiative to audit Democratic-run cities for "wasteful" spending led to an intimidating police visit. Two armed officers were sent to the home of a retired military veteran who had mailed Ingoglia a non-threatening postcard that simply read, "You lack values." Critics argue the visit was an abuse of power designed to stifle dissent and question its justification as a use of taxpayer money. This incident occurs as officials in targeted areas, like Broward County, push back against Ingoglia's claims of overspending, calling his calculations inaccurate and politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Steven Gerrard has turned down the opportunity to return as manager of the Rangers Football Club, leaving the organization scrambling for a new leader. After flying to London for discussions with the club's hierarchy, Gerrard concluded that the timing was not right for his return, reportedly due in part to a reluctance to work under the team's current sporting director structure. This is the second time Gerrard has rejected the role since the dismissal of the previous manager, Philippe Clement. The decision has left the Rangers board in a difficult position, as Gerrard was their top choice to unite the fanbase and stabilize the team.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has claimed its forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts during overnight operations along the shared border. The clashes represent a significant escalation in tensions, which Afghanistan states were a response to repeated violations of its territory, including alleged Pakistani bombings earlier in the week. Pakistan has not confirmed the casualties but condemned the initial Afghan attack, stating its army delivered a "befitting reply." The key Torkham and Chaman border crossings have been closed, halting trade and movement, as regional powers like Saudi Arabia call for restraint and de-escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant escalation in the trade war with China, declaring an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, set to begin in November. This new levy will be applied on top of existing tariffs, bringing the total rate to 130%. The move is a direct response to new Chinese export controls on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for numerous high-tech and defense products. The administration also plans to implement export controls on critical American software, further intensifying economic tensions ahead of a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders.

Kay was previously convicted and sentenced to 22 years in prison for providing the fentanyl-laced pills that led to Skaggs' 2019 overdose.

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is largely fueled by a partisan dispute over extending enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Democrats insist on extending the subsidies, which make health insurance affordable for 24 million Americans, before the upcoming open enrollment period begins on November 1. Republicans argue that since the credits don't expire until December, there is more time for negotiation.

          <p>Officials in the Trump administration are reportedly exploring the sale of portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to private investors. This unprecedented move could transfer loan management to private entities, raising concerns among consumer advocates about the potential loss of borrower protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and the possibility of loan forgiveness. Critics suggest the plan is driven by a political desire to reduce the federal government's role in education and could prioritize profits for Wall Street over the financial well-being of the 45 million Americans with student debt.

Traditional methods focus on simple sequence similarities, but this new approach examines complex 3D protein structures. The AI model helped identify high-order features in proteins that evolved separately but perform a similar function. This research provides new insights into the genetic and protein-level basis for convergent evolution, where unrelated species adapt in similar ways to their environments or lifestyles.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is preventing newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona from being sworn into office, a delay critics link to her pledge to force a vote on releasing unclassified government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva's vote would provide the 218th and final signature needed on a bipartisan discharge petition to compel the Justice Department to release the documents. Johnson claims he cannot administer the oath during a pro forma session, but he swore in two Republican members under the same circumstances earlier this year. The move is seen as a partisan effort to block a vote on the Epstein records, which President Trump opposes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article delves into the complexities of Chiles vs. Salazar, a Supreme Court case challenging Colorado's ban on conversion therapy for minors on free speech grounds. The author explores the conflict between protecting the First Amendment rights of therapists and the state's interest in preventing harm to children from a practice widely discredited by medical organizations. The piece contrasts the legal argument that therapy is merely "talk" with gut-wrenching accounts from parents whose children were severely harmed or driven to suicide by the therapy. The author ultimately expresses fear that the court's conservative majority will likely side with the therapist, prioritizing free speech over child welfare.</p>

          <p>American doctors and nurses who volunteered in Gaza during the two-year war have shared harrowing accounts of the humanitarian crisis they witnessed. They describe working under constant threat of violence, with overwhelmed hospitals lacking basic supplies like antibiotics and soap, leading to preventable deaths. Volunteers treated countless children with severe injuries, including bullet wounds, and faced scenes of mass casualties with insufficient resources to save everyone. Many, transformed by their experiences, now feel a responsibility to bear witness and advocate for an end to the conflict, despite the steep personal cost of their activism and the trauma they endured.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the fragility of the global economy, underscored by the IMF chief's recent warning for policymakers to "buckle up" just before President Trump announced new tariffs on China. The author argues that while the economy has been resilient, this has been partly due to companies preemptively building inventories and forging new trade routes that bypass the US. However, significant risks remain, including the White House's unpredictable trade policies and an AI boom that could mirror the dotcom bubble. The piece suggests that a sudden market correction, particularly in the tech sector, could have severe worldwide repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Madagascar's government has reported an attempted seizure of power after an elite army unit, known as CAPSAT, claimed it has taken control of the nation's entire military command. The announcement from President Andry Rajoelina's office condemned the move as a violation of the constitution. This development follows weeks of escalating anti-government protests over corruption and the cost-of-living crisis, which soldiers from the CAPSAT unit joined on Saturday. The same unit was instrumental in the 2009 political crisis that initially brought Rajoelina to power, signaling a serious and destabilizing challenge to his current government.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the band Lostprophets, has died after being attacked in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses. West Yorkshire Police have arrested two men on suspicion of murder following the incident. Watkins, 48, was convicted in 2013 for crimes including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, in a case described by the sentencing judge as plunging to "new depths of depravity." A recent report on the prison had noted a marked increase in violence and that many prisoners felt unsafe, particularly those convicted of sexual offenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling its tariffs to 50% for steel imports that exceed a newly reduced tariff-free quota, a move aimed at tackling global overproduction and protecting the struggling European steel industry. This decision mirrors a 50% tariff imposed by the United States earlier this year, prompting accusations of protectionism from China. However, EU officials and industry groups defend the measure as WTO-compliant, arguing it still allows a fair volume of tariff-free imports. Observers suggest the move may be a strategic effort to gain leverage and encourage the Trump administration to offer concessions on its own tariffs against European steel.</p>
