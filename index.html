            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide blackout, affecting approximately 1.4 million customers, marking the second such event in four months. The power outage was attributed to a failure in the protection system and vegetation on a transmission line. LUMA Energy, the private power company responsible for transmission, stated that restoring power to 90% of customers could take two to three days, prioritizing critical facilities like hospitals. The blackout has renewed criticism of the island's aging power infrastructure and the performance of LUMA Energy, leading to calls for grid reform and greater reliance on renewable energy sources.</p>

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem has canceled $2.7 million in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about anti-American and pro-Hamas ideologies on campus. The university has been ordered to submit visa records by April 30, potentially jeopardizing its ability to enroll international students. The canceled grants include funding for violence prevention and public health messaging programs deemed ideologically skewed. This action follows President Trump's earlier decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard and request a review of its tax-exempt status.</p>

            <p>The UK's leading business organizations have jointly urged the government to revise the Employment Rights Bill, expressing concerns that the proposed reforms could hinder economic growth. The bill aims to enhance workers' rights from day one of employment, including sick pay, protection from unfair dismissal, and flexible working requests. However, businesses fear the bill's provisions, such as guaranteed hours, could discourage hiring and increase administrative costs. The government maintains that the bill will significantly upgrade workers' rights and has consulted extensively with businesses.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced an island-wide blackout, leaving 1.4 million customers without power as residents prepared for the Easter weekend. The outage was caused by a transmission line failure in the southern part of the island. LUMA Energy estimates that restoring power could take 48-72 hours. The blackout prompted widespread frustration, with many calling for the government to cancel its contract with LUMA Energy. The island's aging power grid continues to struggle with chronic outages, exacerbated by past hurricanes and lack of investment.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a "challenging scenario" of rising inflation and slower economic growth. Powell noted that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and will likely result in higher prices and reduced growth. Despite these concerns, the Federal Reserve plans to remain patient and assess the impact of the tariffs before making any changes to interest rates. Some Fed officials have expressed differing views on the potential impact of tariffs on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An investigation has traced the flow of weapons from the U.S. to Haiti, revealing how lax laws, absent checks, and suspected corruption enable traffickers to bypass a UN embargo. The BBC investigation traced two boxes of assault rifles and pistols from Florida to Haiti, highlighting the role of the U.S. as a "supermarket" for arms fueling gang violence. The report identifies the use of straw buyers, ant trafficking, and the challenges of inspecting outgoing cargo. The Haitian government is struggling to control the gangs, which now control at least 85% of the capital.</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a stationery business in Florida, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs on Chinese goods. Ley argues that the tariffs, which have significantly increased her costs, were illegally imposed without Congressional approval. She claims that her business cannot survive the "short-term pain" of the tariffs, which have already cost her company nearly $1.2 million. Ley fears she may have to reduce salaries or eliminate positions to cope with the increased financial burden.</p>

Initiatives like the "silver trains" are designed to provide older travelers with opportunities to visit remote parts of the country. The government hopes that increased domestic consumption will reduce reliance on exports and support struggling economies in rural areas. These specially designed trains offer comfortable travel, medical support, and access to tourist attractions and traditional villages.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that autism prevalence has risen to 1 in 31 children, or more than 3% of kids. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the figures as evidence of a growing "epidemic" of autism, a claim that has drawn criticism. Experts suggest the increase could be attributed to improved screening, broader definitions of autism, and increased access to services. The CDC report also noted higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children.</p>
