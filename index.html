          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 11:18:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Grandparents are becoming increasingly important in American family life due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancies, and the rising cost of childcare. With falling birth rates, grandparents have fewer grandchildren, allowing them to dedicate more time and attention to each child, contributing to deeper relationships. They offer unique benefits, such as fresh perspectives and a more relaxed approach to childcare, and they are also stepping in to fill gaps in America's child care system, though this can create financial and emotional strain. Experts emphasize the need for policies that support grandparents in their caregiving roles, ensuring they can be involved without undue pressure or exhaustion.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has announced its agreement to acquire Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange based in Dubai, for $2.9 billion. The deal, comprising $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock, aims to position Coinbase as a global leader in crypto derivatives, expanding its reach beyond the U.S. market. Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume last year and boasts about $30 billion in open interest, making it a profitable acquisition for Coinbase as the crypto industry experiences regulatory tailwinds and increased M&A activity. This strategic move diversifies Coinbase's revenue streams and enhances its profitability, with the transaction expected to close by year-end.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a dip after the company released mixed first-quarter results and provided a cautious outlook for the current period. While earnings per share exceeded expectations, the company's guidance for gross profit and revenue growth fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. Shopify's President, Harley Finkelstein, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which could impact the company's predominantly small- to medium-sized business merchants, though he stated the impact is not expected to be meaningful in the near term. Finkelstein emphasized that Shopify's customer base tends to be higher-income consumers who are less price-sensitive, and that the company is actively monitoring data to support merchants through any arising changes.</p>

After the stranded Rwandans reached out to a social media influencer for help, the influencer tagged the government on his platforms. Government officials, working with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), are aware of five more citizens who remain in these countries and are working to bring them home. The government has expressed concern over illegal recruitment and human trafficking, while local trade unions acknowledge the difficulty of identifying forced labor due to cultural norms and minimized workers' rights.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow underscores China's crucial role in Russia's economic survival, as Western sanctions over the Ukraine war have increased Russia's reliance on Beijing for energy exports and access to manufactured goods. Bilateral trade between the two countries has soared, and they have tightened military bonds. Experts note that China's support, including the purchase of discounted Russian oil and gas, has helped Russia withstand Western sanctions, though secondary sanctions from the U.S. continue to pose challenges to Sino-Russian economic interaction.

          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining steady interest rates at the Fed's recent meeting, labeling him a "fool" for not cutting rates sooner. This criticism comes as the Bank of England lowered its main interest rate amid concerns over the potential global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies. Powell has emphasized the Fed's independence and the importance of insulating it from political influence to make decisions based on economic data. Economists generally agree that central bank independence is crucial for maintaining low inflation and full employment, and some analysts suggest that Trump's pressure on Powell could backfire and force the Fed to proceed cautiously.</p>

This decision has been welcomed by Nvidia, which had criticized the policy, but analysts are uncertain about what will replace it. The Bernstein analysts suggest that a government-to-government agreement might be worse than the Biden policy because it would be time-consuming and could result in AI chip access being used as a tool in trade negotiations over tariffs. The Commerce Department has opened a national security probe into semiconductors and other electronics, a precursor for Trump to impose targeted duties under a 1960s trade law.</p>

          <p>A woman, Nicola Packer, accused of having an illegal abortion has been acquitted by a jury at Isleworth Crown Court. Packer was charged with unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing with the intent to procure a miscarriage. The trial heard that she took abortion medicine at home during the second coronavirus lockdown, when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, later taking the dead baby to a hospital.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Office for Students (OfS) indicates that over four in ten universities in England anticipate financial deficits by this summer, driven primarily by a drop in international student numbers following visa changes. Universities are responding by closing courses and selling buildings, but the OfS emphasizes the need for significant reforms and efficiencies to reverse the trend. Universities UK (UUK) describes the report as "deeply sobering," citing frozen domestic tuition fees and a failure of research grants to cover costs as contributing factors, while the University and College Union (UCU) highlights the potential loss of over 10,000 jobs in the sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU is contemplating imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in an attempt to persuade President Trump to drop his existing and proposed tariffs against the EU. This potential action targets key US exports, including Boeing aircraft, chemicals, and agricultural products, and comes as Brussels consults with member states on potential litigation against the US over reciprocal tariffs. The EU's move is a contingency plan in case some or all US tariffs remain after Trump's July deadline for deals, with officials emphasizing they are not pursuing a "dollar for dollar" retaliation but preparing for the long-term prospect of Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Weighing the Pros and Cons of Using Inheritance to Pay Off Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 10:46:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move, particularly given elevated interest rates and high consumer debt, but it's not always the best option. While paying off high-interest debt can offer an immediate return and reduce monthly obligations, the decision depends on individual financial situations, goals, and potential alternative uses for the money. It may not be the best move if balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or being managed effectively. If you do not have an inheritance, there are debt management and debt consolidation options that may help to reduce what you owe and get back on track.</p>

          <p>CBS News has been granted access to Russia to cover the annual "Victory Day" parade in Moscow, marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. This development signals a thaw in U.S. relations with Russia under President Trump, with American media invited to witness the commemorations. President Putin's guest of honor is China's President Xi Jinping, with the two leaders signing over 20 "bilateral cooperation documents." While the celebrations commemorate an 80-year-old victory, fighting continues in Ukraine, and President Trump is pushing for a ceasefire, though Putin has thus far declined to agree.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has achieved a significant political victory with a trade agreement with the United States, validating his strategy of cultivating President Trump. The agreement, announced by Trump on social media, positions Britain as the first country to conclude a deal with the U.S. after the imposition of tariffs on numerous trading partners. While the details of the agreement are still emerging and could face domestic challenges, it underscores the "special relationship" between Britain and the U.S. and reflects Starmer's diplomatic efforts to maintain positive relations with the Trump administration.</p>

The ruling narrows the scope of a sprawling multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing increasing dissent from Labour MPs over proposed welfare cuts, with some warning they are "impossible to support" without a change of direction. Forty-two MPs have expressed concerns about the Â£5 billion in planned welfare savings, particularly regarding the impact on disabled individuals and their families. The MPs are urging ministers to delay decisions until assessments of the potential impact on employment and health are published, as the planned cuts are seen as the biggest attack on the welfare state since George Osborne's austerity measures.</p>

Experts conclude that Mahdi endured excruciating conscious pain and suffering for about 30 to 60 seconds, longer than the expected 10 to 15 seconds had the execution been conducted successfully.</p>
