            <h2>China's Consumer Prices Drop Amid Trade Tensions with US</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-09 21:35:43 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>China reported a decrease in consumer prices in March, coinciding with escalating trade tensions with the US, marked by increased import duties on Chinese goods. The national consumer price index fell 0.1% year-on-year, while the producer price index declined by 2.5%, continuing a 30-month contraction. This situation has prompted Chinese exporters to focus on domestic markets amid the ongoing trade war and tariff escalations from the US. The drop in prices may reflect weakening domestic demand and the impact of trade policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war strategy is increasingly focused on China, with a 125% tariff imposed on Chinese goods while pausing higher tariffs for most other countries. This move signifies a shift from a broad-based trade conflict to a more targeted approach against China, driven by concerns over China's trade practices and its economic model. Trump aims to reshape the global trading system and challenge China's dominance in manufacturing, particularly in key sectors like electric vehicles.

The Senate-passed blueprint is crucial for implementing Trump's agenda, but opposition from hardline conservatives in the House poses a challenge. The President is supporting Johnson in his efforts to pass the budget.</p>
