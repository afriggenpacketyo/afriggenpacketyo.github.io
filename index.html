          <p>Nomura Holdings, a Japanese investment bank, is set to acquire Macquarie's U.S. and European public asset management businesses for $1.8 billion in an all-cash transaction. This strategic move aims to bolster Nomura's global asset management division, increasing its assets under management from $590 billion to $770 billion. Macquarie will retain its Australian public investments business and collaborate with Nomura on future product distribution opportunities, including Nomura serving as a U.S. wealth distribution partner for Macquarie's alternative investment capabilities. The deal is expected to have a minimal impact on Nomura's financials, with both companies continuing independent operations until the transaction closes, pending regulatory approvals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a $14 billion budget that addresses a nearly $1 billion financial gap by eliminating over 2,700 city positions, including approximately 1,650 layoffs. While the Fire Department would see new hires following the Palisades fire, other agencies, including the LAPD, Transportation Department, and Bureau of Sanitation, would face significant spending reductions. Union leaders are vowing to fight the layoffs and are seeking state financial assistance to avoid the job cuts. The proposed budget aims to protect core services like libraries and recreation centers while consolidating smaller agencies and eliminating citizen commissions focused on health, innovation, and climate change.</p>

          <p>Following Nico Iamaleava's decision to transfer from Tennessee to UCLA, Joey Aguilar, who had recently joined UCLA, is now transferring to Tennessee. Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee was reportedly due to a dispute over NIL negotiations, where he sought a $4 million deal for the upcoming season. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, has accumulated 6,760 passing yards and 56 touchdowns in the past two seasons. Iamaleava threw for 2,616 yards and 19 touchdowns last season, leading Tennessee to a College Football Playoff spot.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making. The lawsuit challenges the administration's threat to review $9 billion in federal funding after Harvard refused to comply with demands, including appointing an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserts that no government should dictate what universities teach, admit, or research. The administration's actions, including freezing funding and threatening tax-exempt status revocation, have significant consequences for Harvard's patients, students, faculty, and research, as well as the standing of American higher education.</p>

          <p>Following the destructive Palisades wildfire, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is proposing to add 227 positions to the Fire Department, including firefighters and emergency medical technicians.

          <p>Bitcoin's price is predicted to exceed $100,000 due to a weakening U.S. dollar, potential Treasury buybacks, and strong institutional interest. Arthur Hayes suggests this may be the last opportunity to acquire Bitcoin below $100,000, anticipating that Treasury buybacks will infuse liquidity into the market. Despite some analysts cautioning against weekend rallies, the convergence of macroeconomic factors and political climate could drive Bitcoin's upward trajectory. Projections from analysts like Jamie Coutts suggest Bitcoin could reach $132,000 by year-end, with economist Timothy Peterson suggesting a potential $138,000 within three months (not investment advice).</p>

The map shows connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. The research also reveals differences in the structure and cell types of macaque and rodent claustrums, which could provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. While the claustrum's role in brain functions like sleep regulation and cognitive control is known, its molecular and cellular organization has been poorly understood.</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's call for lower interest rates and his administration's tariff plans have contributed to market turmoil. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw significant losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets, with the price of gold reaching a new record high amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, the "doomsday mom" convicted of murdering her children, delivered her closing argument in Arizona, where she is charged with conspiring to kill her fourth husband. She maintains that her brother shot her husband in self-defense, while prosecutors argue it was a ploy for her to collect his life insurance and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The prosecution argued that Daybell and her brother used twisted religious beliefs to justify the murder. The jury is now deliberating the verdict.</p>
