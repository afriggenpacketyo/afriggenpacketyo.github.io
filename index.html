          <p>The UK government announced another delay to the HS2 high-speed rail project, with no new completion date provided.  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander cited "shocking mismanagement" and ballooning costs as reasons for the postponement, exceeding the initial budget by £37 billion.  The delay pushes the opening beyond the 2033 target, impacting the planned route between London and Birmingham.  Two reports are underway to assess the project's failures and suggest improvements for future infrastructure projects.</p>

The aging U.S. population and declining worker-to-retiree ratio contribute to the financial strain on the system.
