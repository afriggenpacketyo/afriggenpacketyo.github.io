          <p>Senators are calling for an ethics probe into President Trump's plan to host a dinner for top investors in his meme coin, $TRUMP, citing potential "pay to play" corruption. The value of the coin surged after the announcement of the dinner, raising concerns that Trump and his family are profiting from their political influence. The senators are questioning whether this action violates federal ethics rules and what safeguards exist to prevent individuals under investigation from buying political access through investments. Optimism score: 35</p>
          <p>35/100</p>
