          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been the top pick. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player, adding to the draft's unpredictability. The draft is considered less talent-laden than previous years, leading to varied forecasts and heightened anticipation for rounds two through seven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joseph Kling, 19, faces arson charges for allegedly starting a bonfire that led to a large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, which has burned over 15,000 acres. The fire, which started in Waretown, spread into Lacey Township and destroyed a commercial building, forcing thousands to evacuate. While all evacuation orders have been lifted, the fire is only 50% contained and is expected to burn for days, prompting air quality concerns in New York City.

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly considering a proposal that would deviate from over a decade of U.S. policy regarding Crimea. The potential agreement would involve walking away from the official "Crimea Declaration" issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged to maintain the nonrecognition of Russia's annexation of the territory until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. This shift comes as Trump seeks to negotiate an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, signaling a potential change in U.S. foreign policy under his administration.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are facing scrutiny as projected savings fall far short of initial promises. While Musk initially pledged to save taxpayers trillions of dollars, revised estimates suggest savings of only $150 billion. Moreover, the costs associated with firings, re-hirings, and lost productivity resulting from DOGE's actions could negate these savings. The Partnership for Public Service estimates these costs could reach $135 billion this fiscal year, raising questions about the true impact of DOGE's initiatives.</p>

CEO Lip-Bu Tan outlined a strategy to optimize existing products for emerging AI trends, taking a holistic approach similar to Nvidia's data center offerings. With limited resources for acquisitions, Intel will focus on in-house development and software support.

          <p>The FCC is reportedly seeking concessions from Paramount Global regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs as a condition for approving its merger with Skydance Media. The FCC, under Trump appointees, is requiring the merged company to abstain from DEI programs, reflecting the administration's stance against such initiatives. The review of the merger has been stalled, and Paramount is reportedly in settlement talks with Trump's legal team over a lawsuit, potentially to ensure government approval of the merger. The executive producer of "60 Minutes" resigned, citing corporate interference related to stories investigating the Trump Administration.</p>
