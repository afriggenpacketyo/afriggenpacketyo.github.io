          <p>A new study indicates that while parents in Europe find greater meaning in life, they often experience lower life satisfaction compared to their child-free counterparts. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that mothers' life satisfaction is particularly affected. However, Scandinavian countries show less disparity due to robust family policies, including childcare and parental leave. The study suggests that societal support and gender equality play significant roles in parental well-being.</p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming strategic defence review will outline significant new investments in national security to send a strong message to hostile states, particularly Moscow. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" from Russia and other countries, including China. As part of this effort, the government announced a Â£1.5 billion investment in new defence factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK. The government intends to support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, increasing the UK's readiness to fight if required.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's policies towards China, characterized by a mix of aggression and weakness, are increasing the likelihood of a conflict over Taiwan. Trump's trade tariffs and discriminatory curbs on technology transfers are seen as provocative, potentially pushing Xi Jinping to take action. Tisdall suggests that Trump's reluctance to defend core western interests, as seen in Ukraine, emboldens China and makes Taiwan a vulnerable target. The author asserts that the U.S. now looks beatable, making it tempting for China to seize the island.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sunita Puri, a palliative care physician, reflects on the importance of living fully and authentically, especially when facing mortality. She shares the story of a patient whose dreams were cut short by a cancer diagnosis, highlighting the need to consider what it means to live fully before death is imminent. Puri suggests that reflection on mortality often leads people to seek a more complicated version of the ordinary, reconciling the differences between the life they have and the one they longed for. She advocates for living with an awareness of life's uncertainty and embracing the possibility of living freely.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit, restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite its potential impact on medal prospects.

Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the decision, citing the risk of children attempting difficult tricks without proper physical development.

          <p>Japan's Penal Code has been amended to prioritize rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first changes to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work is not mandatory. This allows more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law stipulates that inmates can undertake "necessary work" or undergo "necessary guidance" tailored to their age, characteristics, and other factors, with reviews every six months.</p>
