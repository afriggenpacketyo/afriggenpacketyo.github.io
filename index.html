          <p>Over 30 years after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, leaving a lasting scar on the community and the victims' families. The investigation was fraught with challenges, including coerced confessions that were later overturned and a lack of definitive physical evidence. Despite the passage of time, investigators and family members hold out hope that advancements in DNA technology, focusing on a small sample found on one victim, could finally identify the perpetrators. A new federal law, motivated by this case, now allows families of cold case victims to request federal reviews with the latest technology, offering a potential path to justice.</p>

          <p>In an interview marking 40 years since his arrest, David Berkowitz, the serial killer known as "Son of Sam," discussed the 1976-77 murder spree that terrorized New York City. Berkowitz, now a born-again Christian serving six life sentences, described his past actions as being influenced by demonic forces and expressed remorse for the pain he caused. He detailed a troubled childhood and struggles with depression, but took responsibility for the six deaths and seven injuries he inflicted. Survivors and detectives involved in the case reflected on the lasting trauma, with some expressing doubt about the sincerity of his conversion while acknowledging his efforts to minister to other inmates.</p>

He admitted there were times he questioned leaving his previous successful post at Sporting, but feels the club's decision not to fire him demonstrates their support more than words. Amorim emphasized that he is now implementing a stricter culture with a new player leadership group to uphold standards. He expressed a renewed belief in the team's competitiveness and a long-term goal to remain as manager for 20 years, promising fans a better season ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing criticism from environmental groups after declining to reappoint a clean energy advocate to the state's public utilities commission, instead choosing a former political staffer described as an "industry ally." The move is alleged to have been influenced by utility giant DTE Energy, a major political donor, which was reportedly unhappy with the outgoing commissioner's stance against rate hikes and support for public involvement. Activists fear the appointment could hinder Michigan's clean energy transition and favor utility interests, especially as the commission reviews over $1 billion in proposed rate increases and long-term energy plans. Both the governor's office and the utilities have denied any improper influence in the appointment process.</p>

The organization, which had not previously operated in the country, responded to an urgent call from a hospital in Sweida, coordinating with the Israel Defense Forces to deliver medicine, equipment, and retired Israeli ambulances. This aid effort occurs in a hostile region where Syria is officially an enemy state of Israel, highlighting a unique collaboration. Organizers emphasized the mission as a stand for Judeo-Christian values against extremism, providing life-saving support despite the significant risks involved.</p>

          <p>Engineers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the world's first brain-like computer containing over 2 billion artificial neurons, named the Darwin Monkey. This new system represents a significant advancement in neuromorphic computing, which mimics the structure and function of the human brain. Built with 960 domestically produced Darwin 3 chips, the computer is capable of creating over 100 billion synapses. It has already been successfully used for complex tasks such as content generation, logical reasoning, and mathematics, demonstrating its potential to advance the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the Trump administration's broad application of tariffs, stating they are a key tool for reducing the trade deficit and reshoring American manufacturing. Greer explained that the administration views tariffs as a valid response not only to trade imbalances but also to geopolitical issues, citing actions against Canada and Brazil as examples of using economic leverage for non-trade-related foreign policy objectives. He dismissed concerns that the tariffs were harming U.S. companies, arguing they create necessary incentives for domestic investment. Greer also confirmed ongoing, positive discussions with China to avoid a significant tariff increase ahead of an August 12 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While major donors like the United States, UK, and Germany are cutting their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries, notably Spain and Ireland, are increasing their commitments. This shift comes as the global development fund is projected to shrink by billions, creating a significant vacuum in humanitarian support for issues like disease prevention and food assistance. Spain has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, a move rooted in long-standing public support for development assistance. This emerging trend could reshape global aid dynamics, potentially leading to a more collaborative and less paternalistic model, as former aid-recipient nations like South Korea also become more significant donors.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with weather warnings upgraded to amber for most of Scotland, indicating a potential danger to life from strong winds and damage to infrastructure. The warning is in effect for Monday, with gusts of 50 to 70 mph expected inland and potentially reaching 80 to 90 mph in exposed coastal areas. A yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. Due to trees being in full leaf, they are more susceptible to being toppled, increasing risks of power disruption and travel chaos. National Rail and Scottish ferry operator CalMac have already warned of likely speed restrictions, delays, and cancellations.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has stated that a deliberate Israeli military attack on its headquarters in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, killed one of its workers and injured three others. The humanitarian group reported that the Sunday morning attack sparked a fire and caused significant damage to the building, which it says was clearly marked with the protective red emblem. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated it had no knowledge of strikes in that specific area. This incident occurs amid escalating warnings about the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN reporting over 1,300 Palestinians killed while seeking food since late May.</p>

          <p>The Czech Republic has amended its criminal code to outlaw the promotion of communist ideology, placing it on the same legal footing as Nazi propaganda, with punishments of up to five years in prison. The law, which takes effect in 2026, was championed by former anti-communist activists and passed by the current pro-European government. The move is politically charged, as the country's Communist Party (KSCM) remains a political force and is part of a left-wing coalition expected to win seats in the upcoming parliamentary elections.

          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that seismic activity may be a key energy source for life in Earth's deep biosphere, a vast, hidden ecosystem estimated to contain the majority of the planet's prokaryotes. Scientists have long wondered how microbes survive in these isolated, nutrient-poor environments miles below the surface. The research proposes that the friction and pressure from earthquakes can break down minerals and water, releasing hydrogen gas. This hydrogen can then be used by deep-dwelling microbes as a fuel source for chemosynthesis, a process of creating energy without sunlight, thereby powering these deep, dark ecosystems.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on the crucial, yet undramatic, work of George Washington in the summer of 1775 as he transformed a collection of colonial militias into the Continental Army. Despite his initial disdain for the undisciplined New England troops, Washington's leadership transcended his personal prejudices, focusing on essential organization, discipline, and sanitation to build a cohesive fighting force. He identified and promoted talented subordinates like Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox based on merit, not social status, creating a truly American army. The article argues that this quiet, foundational work, rooted in character and judgment, was more critical to the Revolution's success than battlefield brilliance and remains a vital example of leadership today.</p>

This conflict highlights the complex dynamic between the two titans, whose partnership helped fuel Trump's political rise and Fox News's ratings dominance. Despite Murdoch's outlets often championing Trump, the media baron has shown signs of distancing himself, reflecting a history of shifting political allegiances and a desire to remain a "kingmaker" rather than a subordinate.</p>

This shared sentiment for transparency transcends partisan divides, with Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike expressing that if powerful people, including the president, were involved in Epstein's crimes, the public has a right to know.

          <p>The Trump administration's Board of Immigration Appeals has issued a ruling that significantly curtails the ability of women to seek asylum in the U.S. based on gender-based violence. The decision holds that a "particular social group," one of the five grounds for refugee protection, cannot be defined by gender, effectively reversing decades of legal precedent that evolved after the 1993 Vienna Conference on Human Rights. Critics argue this move returns U.S. policy to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private matter, not a basis for international protection.

          <p>Despite President Trump's escalating trade war and new tariffs on numerous countries, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly resilient, with Wall Street near record highs and second-quarter growth exceeding expectations.

However, warning signs are emerging, such as a recent dip in jobs numbers and the fact that the average U.S. tariff rate has now jumped to its highest level since the 1930s. While an economic hurricane may have been avoided for now, significant damage is still being done to global trade and consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in over five centuries, sending an ash plume six kilometers into the sky. Experts suggest the eruption may be linked to a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the region last week. Shortly after the volcanic eruption, another strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit the nearby Kuril Islands, prompting tsunami warnings for parts of the peninsula. The region lies within the seismically active "Pacific Ring of Fire," but the confluence of a powerful quake and a historic eruption has drawn significant attention from scientists.</p>

          <p>Chile's total fertility rate has plummeted to just over one child per woman, one of the lowest in the world and significantly below the population replacement level. This rapid demographic shift, driven by the high cost of living and increased autonomy and education for women, may foreshadow future trends in the United States, where the birth rate also recently hit a record low. As Chile's population ages and begins to shrink, it faces profound challenges to its economy, labor market, and pension systems. While conservative politicians express alarm, many young women in Chile see smaller families or child-free lives as a personal choice, unswayed by potential government incentives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is taking a more aggressive approach to collecting an estimated $23 billion in Social Security overpayments owed to the government. The Social Security Administration has reinstated a higher clawback rate, garnishing up to 50% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the debt is repaid, a significant increase from the 10% rate under the previous administration. This policy affects potentially more than a million Americans who were overpaid due to errors by the agency or beneficiaries. Those affected have legal options to contest the debt or request a waiver or reduced payment plan if they can demonstrate the overpayment was not their fault and repayment would cause financial hardship.

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has caused a massive fire at an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort city of Sochi, according to Russian authorities. The strike is part of a broader Ukrainian campaign targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation for sustained Russian bombardment of Ukraine's own power grid. Over the weekend, Russia reported intercepting nearly 100 Ukrainian drones, primarily over the Black Sea region. This escalation follows a particularly deadly week in Ukraine, including a Russian missile attack on Kyiv that killed over 30 people, prompting calls from Ukrainian and U.S. leaders for stronger sanctions against Moscow.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting people who advertise illegal Channel crossings and other immigration services online, with potential penalties of up to five years in prison. The measure is part of a broader crackdown on people-smuggling gangs amid a record number of migrant arrivals via small boats in 2025. Officials believe the new law, which would have extra-territorial reach, will provide more power to disrupt criminal networks that use social media to promote their services. The opposition has criticized the plan as "too little, too late," arguing for more robust deportation measures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut its key interest rate this week by 0.25 percentage points to 4.0%, marking the fifth reduction since last August. The move is anticipated as a response to a weakening UK economy, evidenced by rising unemployment, which hit a three-year high of 4.7%, and negative growth in April and May. Economic pressure has been exacerbated by the global trade impact of new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration. While the rate cut will provide relief for borrowers, it highlights the risk of stagflation, as inflation remains well above the Bank's 2% target, creating a difficult balancing act for policymakers.

          <p>A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kuril Islands, prompting a tsunami warning for a section of the Kamchatka Peninsula. While officials stated the expected wave heights were low, they still advised residents to move away from the shore as a precaution. This is the second major seismic event in the region within a week, following a powerful 8.8 magnitude quake. The seismic activity is also being linked by experts to the recent eruption of the Krasheninnikov volcano, which had been dormant for over 500 years, highlighting the extreme geological volatility of the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

          <p>A couple in Guernsey was stunned to discover a World War II German bunker hidden beneath their home's driveway. Having bought the property four years ago, they knew it was the site of a former gun emplacement but were tipped off by a previous resident about the possibility of a hidden structure. After digging up their driveway, they unearthed a two-room bunker complete with tiled floors, an escape hatch, and German writing on the walls. The Channel Islands were occupied by German forces from 1940 to 1945, and the couple plans to preserve the historical elements while converting the space into a games room and gym.</p>

          <p>A global TikTok trend surrounding Labubu collectible dolls has led to a flood of dangerous counterfeit versions on the market, prompting police and Trading Standards raids in the UK. Authorities recently seized millions of pounds worth of fake products from a London location, finding that the counterfeit dolls easily fall apart, creating serious choking hazards for children. In addition to poor construction, investigators warn these fakes can be made with toxic materials and banned chemicals. The high demand for genuine dolls, which sell out in seconds, has created a lucrative market for both scalpers reselling authentic products at a markup and criminals producing the unsafe knock-offs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new climate study suggests that significant reductions in air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have inadvertently accelerated global warming. While efforts to clean the air, particularly in China, have improved public health, they have also removed aerosols—tiny particles that reflect sunlight and help cool the planet. According to the research, the 75% drop in sulphur dioxide in the region since 2013 is likely responsible for up to 0.05 degrees Celsius of the observed global surface warming. This highlights a complex environmental trade-off, suggesting that polluted air may have been masking some of the full impact of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
