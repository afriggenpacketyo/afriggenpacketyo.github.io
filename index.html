          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, also known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks surged after both companies announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The new company will acquire all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity worth around $9 billion with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger will unwind a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, though critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the promise of implementing the largest deportation program in U.S. history, President Donald Trump is pushing a series of operations that aim to arrest and deport migrants with irregular status, which is causing fear even among those who have residency or are U.S. citizens. Alex G√°lvez, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, states that citizens do not have to fear being questioned when returning from a trip; however, residents are exposed to the discretion of an officer when entering the country. The lawyer advises that if someone has permanent residency and thinks they will be outside the U.S. for more than 6 months, it is better to request a permit so that the authorities do not think that the person abandoned the residency.</p>

          <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that at least 21 people were killed and dozens were shot in an incident near an aid distribution center in Rafah, Gaza. The ICRC said its field hospital received a mass casualty influx of 179 cases, including women and children, with the majority suffering gunshot or shrapnel wounds. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that findings from an initial inquiry showed its forces had not fired at people near or within the aid center. The BBC could not immediately verify the footage.</p>

          <p>South Korea's election is taking place under the shadow of martial law declared last December by President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was subsequently impeached. The opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, has been campaigning in a bulletproof vest and behind bulletproof glass due to death threats. The election is seen as an opportunity to heal the fractures caused by the martial law crisis. Lee has shifted his policies to the right, courting conglomerate businesses and adopting a more pragmatic foreign policy.</p>
