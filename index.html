          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, after which ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. This arrangement, expected to be announced during Trump's visit to Qatar, raises legal questions about accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign power. Lawyers from the White House counsel's office and the DOJ have reportedly drafted an analysis concluding the gift is legal and does not violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause. The plane would initially be transferred to the Air Force for modifications before being given to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps has established the Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) to integrate armed first-person view (FPV) drones into its forces, enhancing small-unit lethality with drones costing under $5,000. This move is a response to the rapid development of drone technology by countries like China, Russia, and Iran, with experts arguing that the U.S. needs to view drones as a form of ammunition. The article highlights Ukraine's advancements in domestic drone production, manufacturing over 1.5 million FPV drones in 2024, and the dominance of Chinese company DJI in the global drone market, raising national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in Fort Lauderdale has sparked controversy, with some residents alleging racial motives. The basketball courts, popular among a diverse crowd, were built shortly after the end of segregation on the city's beaches. Critics fear that converting the courts to pickleball will destroy a community tradition and exclude minority residents who frequent the area. Developers argue that pickleball has broader appeal, while opponents claim the decision reflects an effort to attract a more affluent, less diverse demographic to the beach.</p>

          <p>After a century of upward climb, US life expectancy has recently declined, prompting scientists to seek ways to reverse this trend. Dr. Eric Topol suggests adopting evidence-based steps, including knowing and lowering one's biological age, eating a Mediterranean-style diet, sleeping more deeply, engaging in strength training, and fostering social connections. The article cites studies showing the benefits of these practices, such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and decreased mortality rates.

          <p>The new German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has begun rejecting asylum seekers at its borders with neighboring European countries, marking a significant shift in immigration policy. In the first two days of tightened border controls, authorities turned away 19 asylum seekers, citing reasons such as invalid visas and fake documents. This move, supported by around two-thirds of Germans, aims to curb illegal migrant entries and address the rising popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, but it has faced criticism from politicians, neighboring EU countries, and human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Mexico is grappling with the question of whether to ban "narcocorridos," or drug ballads, which are increasingly popular but also seen by some as glorifying violence. Approximately one-third of Mexico's states have already enacted bans, leading to debates about freedom of expression and state censorship. Proponents of the bans argue that they are necessary to prevent the romanticization of drug trafficking, while opponents contend that they are a form of censorship that will not address the root causes of the problem.</p>
