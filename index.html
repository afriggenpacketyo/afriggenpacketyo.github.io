Domestic shipments have increased significantly, driven by the flexibility of gin production and the ability to convert existing equipment from whiskey and shochu making. Distillers are incorporating local specialties such as bitter gourd, camellia flowers, and burnt lacquer wood, and this trend is prompting major manufacturers to release canned gin products, and gin-focused bars and e-commerce sites are emerging, catering to the growing demand.</p>

          <p>The government is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding in England, prioritizing training opportunities for individuals under 21 years old, with funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, being limited to this age group. This shift aims to redirect funds towards younger adults and address the decline in entry-level apprenticeships, while concerns have been raised about the impact on advanced NHS training and access to professions for those not attending university. The government promises to create 120,000 more training opportunities and will use an increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK to fund 45,000 training places.</p>
