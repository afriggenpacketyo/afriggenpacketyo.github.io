          <p>Liverpool has finalized the acquisition of French striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt in a deal initially valued at £69 million, with potential add-ons increasing the total to £79 million. The 23-year-old has successfully completed his medical examination and agreed to personal terms with the club. Ekitike is scheduled to join his new team for their pre-season tour in Asia later this week. This high-profile transfer elevates Liverpool's total summer spending to over £250 million, following other significant signings.</p>

          <p>Dr. Salvador Plasencia has pleaded guilty to four federal counts of distributing ketamine, admitting he illegally supplied the drug to actor Matthew Perry in the month before his death. Perry's death was ruled an accident from the acute effects of ketamine. In a plea agreement, Plasencia admitted to providing Perry with multiple vials and lozenges of the drug for $4,500, with prosecutors noting he exploited the actor's addiction. He now faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison and is expected to surrender his medical license.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced a temporary pause on loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers enrolled in the income-based repayment (IBR) plan. This halt is a result of court injunctions related to legal challenges against the Biden administration's broader student loan forgiveness initiatives, such as the SAVE plan. Officials stated the pause is necessary to recalculate payment counts accurately but did not provide a specific timeline for resumption. Borrowers are advised to continue making payments, with the department promising to refund any overpayments once discharges resume. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a dual legal development, Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was ordered to be released from criminal custody by a federal judge in Tennessee. Concurrently, another federal judge, Paula Xinis, issued an order barring immigration authorities from immediately detaining him for deportation upon his release. The ruling mandates a 72-hour notice period before any removal proceedings can begin, ensuring he has time to seek legal counsel. Abrego Garcia, who faces human smuggling charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, will be released under conditions set by a magistrate judge.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students.

          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow a large sum like $100,000, a home equity loan currently presents a more affordable option compared to a personal loan due to lower interest rates.

Over a 15-year term, for example, choosing a home equity loan could save a borrower over $47,000 in total interest charges.

          <p>The Bregenz Festival, a major arts event in a small Austrian town, is drawing large crowds with its ambitious opera productions, including a spectacular outdoor staging of "Die Freischütz" on a massive stage built on Lake Constance. This production features elaborate sets and special effects for an audience of 7,000. The festival also revived George Enescu’s critically acclaimed but rarely performed opera “Oedipe” in its main theater. The article contrasts the town's significant cultural investment and ambition with a recent 30% cut in its government funding, highlighting the challenges facing the arts.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union are reportedly close to finalizing a trade agreement that would impose a 15% tariff on most goods imported from the EU. This rate would be similar to the one in the recent U.S.-Japan deal but higher than the 10% baseline agreed upon with the UK. While some products like aircraft and medical devices may be exempt, the deal would be a blow to sectors like the German auto industry. In response to potential U.S. reluctance, the EU is also preparing retaliatory measures, threatening nearly €100 billion in tariffs on American imports.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat in 2026, ending speculation that he would run for governor of New York. Lawler stated that while he considers incumbent Kathy Hochul to be the "worst governor in America," he believes the best course of action is to focus on retaining his congressional seat. His district is a key battleground, and his victory was crucial for the current narrow Republican House majority. The decision also reshapes the potential field of Republican challengers for the governorship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the political maneuvering of Senator Josh Hawley, who, after vocally opposing cuts to Medicaid in President Trump's major legislative bill, ultimately voted in favor of it. Hawley had framed the cuts as "morally wrong," yet his support was decisive in the bill's passage. Shortly after the vote, he introduced new legislation to reverse some of the very cuts he had just helped enact. The analysis suggests Hawley's actions reflect a difficult balancing act: trying to maintain populist credibility with an eye on future national ambitions while remaining loyal to the party and the president.</p>

          <p>A persistent high-pressure system, known as a heat dome, is responsible for the dangerous and prolonged heatwave affecting a large portion of the United States. This phenomenon occurs when sinking air compresses and heats up, while also preventing cloud formation, which further intensifies solar heating. The system draws moisture from sources like the Gulf of Mexico and agricultural crops, leading to high humidity that makes the heat feel even more oppressive and dangerous. Climate change is making these heat waves more intense, frequent, and longer-lasting, with nighttime temperatures in particular warming at an accelerated rate.</p>

This move is part of a larger trend of American tech companies reducing their operational footprint in China due to President Trump's tariff policies and U.S. restrictions on technology exports.

The trial revealed a tumultuous relationship, which began with a whirlwind marriage just 13 days after they met. The prosecution argued Ashley killed Doug to win a contentious custody battle over their daughter, while the defense claimed she acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. Despite Ashley's claims, a jury found her guilty of manslaughter, and she was later sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in Germany regarding the potential reintroduction of compulsory military service, with concerns being raised about its economic impact. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has proposed a selective service model to bolster the armed forces amid growing security threats in Europe. However, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations argues that taking young people out of the labor force for military service could harm the economy. Economists suggest the impact depends on the scale of conscription, noting that a smaller, selective draft would have a minimal effect compared to drafting an entire age group.</p>

This article explores the known evidence, including his academic spiral and an alleged obsession with one of the victims, Maddie Mogen, based on his digital footprint.
