          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to cut more than 500 jobs at the Voice of America and its parent organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. An administration official stated the move aims to reduce bureaucracy and save money, asserting it will improve the agency's ability to broadcast truth to those under tyrannical regimes. This decision comes amidst ongoing legal battles, including a recent court order blocking the removal of VOA's director, and has been met with strong opposition from employee groups. Critics worry the cuts will undermine the mission of the broadcaster, which was established during World War II to provide objective news globally.</p>

          <p>A cold case review by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has concluded there is probable cause that Sheriff Buford Pusser, the inspiration for the movie "Walking Tall," murdered his wife in 1967. Prosecutors stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, they would seek a murder indictment. The investigation uncovered inconsistencies with Pusser's original account of an ambush, suggesting his wife, Pauline, was shot outside their vehicle and placed inside. Evidence from a new autopsy also revealed signs of prior domestic violence, challenging the heroic public image of the famed lawman and aiming to bring closure to his wife's family.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a potential precedent, but some councils maintain their challenges are based on planning law breaches and public safety concerns. The ongoing dispute has sparked protests and counter-demonstrations across England and Scotland, leading to several arrests. The government has stated it aims to stop using hotels for asylum seekers, which it deems unsustainable, while critics argue the focus should be on processing asylum claims more quickly to resolve the situation.</p>

She dominated the match, landing nearly 80% of her first serves in the opening set and showing aggressive play from the baseline.

          <p>Chicago's Mayor, Brandon Johnson, is set to sign an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist the Trump administration's planned immigration crackdown. The order explicitly states that Chicago police will not collaborate with federal agents on immigration enforcement operations and calls for the city to pursue all legal avenues to oppose federal efforts. This move comes in response to the administration's 'border czar' announcing ramped-up operations targeting Chicago and other 'sanctuary cities.' The escalating conflict between the city and the federal government highlights the deep political divisions over immigration policy and the use of federal power in Democratic-run municipalities.</p>

Vance, who spoke about being prepared to take over if a tragedy occurred, raising concerns about Trump's health.

As the transfer deadline approaches, talks between the two clubs are ongoing, with Palace reportedly seeking an additional £5 million in bonuses. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely as his current deal expires next summer. Palace, meanwhile, is actively trying to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's departure to Liverpool. An informal proposal to include Liverpool's Joe Gomez in the deal was reportedly rejected by the Merseyside club.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, instructing him to return to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was made after fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap sustained a serious hamstring injury during a match against Fulham, which could sideline him for six to eight weeks. The sudden reversal left Chelsea with only one fit senior striker, prompting the club to revoke permission for the loan. The 24-year-old Jackson is reportedly angry about the collapse of the deal, though attempts may be made to salvage it before the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of expanding expedited removal for undocumented immigrants across the interior of the United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the practice, which allows for rapid deportation with limited due process for those unable to prove continuous presence for two years, is unlawful. This decision curtails the administration's ability to immediately place immigrants into expedited removal proceedings, particularly after their cases are dismissed in court. In a strongly worded opinion, the judge emphasized that the government's argument could threaten the due process rights of citizens and noncitizens alike.</p>

The tool analyzes subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable to the human ear and compares them to a vast database of patient data.

          <h2>Review: 'The Toxic Avenger' Remake Offers Polished Homage to Troma's Trashy Original</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, offers a well-made and surprisingly sincere take on the 1984 Troma cult classic. While retaining the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of the original, this version features a higher production value and a more emotionally grounded hero. Dinklage plays Winston Goose, a terminally ill janitor who, after being thrown into toxic waste, becomes a mutant vigilante fighting a villainous pharmaceutical corporation led by a CEO played by Kevin Bacon. The film functions as a diverting homage, updating the anti-pollution message while poking fun at modern superhero tropes.</p>

          <p>As American unions prepare for Labor Day, the mood is described as sober due to increasing challenges from the Trump administration's policies. Labor groups are contending with immigration raids that disrupt workplaces, proposed cuts to Medicaid services affecting healthcare workers, and a weakened National Labor Relations Board. Union leaders state they are focused on organizing and educating workers on their rights while also protesting government actions. These pressures, combined with potential state budget cuts affecting public sector jobs, have created a sense of crisis for the labor movement, which many feel is fighting for its survival.</p>

          <p>The term 'red pill,' originating from the 1999 film "The Matrix," has evolved from an internet meme into a widespread political and social ideology. Initially adopted by misogynistic 'pick-up artist' and men's rights communities, the concept now underpins a global 'manosphere' that promotes anti-feminist and conspiratorial worldviews. This ideology has seeped into mainstream discourse, amplified by social media algorithms and figures like Andrew Tate. Researchers note its cultural adaptability, with variations emerging in different regions and religious contexts, often bundling existing resentments into a simplified narrative that translates personal frustrations into a perceived social truth.</p>

          <p>A significant number of beaches across the United States are under water quality advisories for high levels of fecal bacteria as swimmers head to the coasts for Labor Day weekend. A report from Environment America found that nearly two-thirds of beaches tested nationwide in 2024 had at least one day with potentially unsafe contamination levels. The issue is attributed to outdated sewer systems, severe weather overwhelming infrastructure, and urban sprawl reducing natural water absorption. These advisories discourage swimming due to the risk of gastrointestinal illness and rashes, highlighting a persistent and widespread public health and environmental problem.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in Northern California has caused an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily impacting wine grape growers in Napa Valley. The fire, which has burned over 6,800 acres, has destroyed crops through both direct heat and smoke taint, which can ruin the flavor of grapes. One winery, Robert Craig, lost its entire crop from a key vineyard, representing a $4.5 million revenue loss after nearly $1 million in farming costs had already been invested. This event adds to the growing challenges for the region's wine industry, which has faced repeated, devastating wildfires in recent years, raising concerns about its long-term viability.</p>

          <p>A recent performance at the Hollywood Bowl titled "Sarabande Africaine" featured a unique collaboration between Afropop star Angélique Kidjo and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The concert explored the African origins of the sarabande, a dance form central to Baroque suites by composers like Bach and Handel. Kidjo transformed classical pieces and standards like Gershwin's "Summertime" with African languages and rhythms, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, background. The show highlighted the surprising connections between musical traditions, culminating in a powerful performance of a Philip Glass song written for Kidjo, which showcased the deep artistic bond between the two performers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread 'reciprocal tariffs' imposed on most trading partners are an illegal use of presidential authority. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used to justify the levies, does not grant the power to impose taxes or duties. This decision upholds a lower court's ruling but allows the tariffs to remain in place until mid-October to permit an appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling represents a significant legal setback for a cornerstone of Trump's economic agenda and creates uncertainty for global trade and the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson, a former Bridgewater strategist, notes that politicizing central banks historically leads to weaker stock markets, higher inflation, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she argues the long-term consequences would be damaging, leading to a weaker dollar and sustained inflation that hurts consumer spending and corporate earnings.

The tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old and dating to the Hellenistic period, were found in the Khanke region of Duhok province. This discovery was made possible by a severe, multi-year drought that has plagued Iraq, significantly lowering its water reserves.
