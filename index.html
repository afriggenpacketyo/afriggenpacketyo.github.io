          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have reported that the number of arrests at a protest against the ban on Palestine Action has risen to 890. The majority of these arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for showing support for a proscribed organization. The government outlawed Palestine Action in July, making any support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. While police cited violence and coordinated disorder from some demonstrators, organizers from Defend Our Juries described the police response as a violent assault on peaceful protesters, calling the ban unenforceable and a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>Former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach for the University of North Carolina, defeating Charlotte 20-3. Following the game, Belichick confirmed reports that he has banned Patriots scouts from attending UNC practices. He stated that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their scouts are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure from the NFL team. The win provided a much-needed morale boost for the Tar Heels after a difficult season-opening loss, with Belichick noting a higher level of determination from his team.</p>

          <p>London is experiencing its first major Tube strike since March 2023, as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union begin a five-day walkout over pay and working conditions. The union is demanding a 32-hour work week, a proposal Transport for London (TfL) has deemed unaffordable, offering a 3.4% pay rise instead. The strike is causing significant disruption, with little to no service expected on most lines from Monday to Thursday, leading to increased congestion on other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground. The industrial action has also forced the rescheduling of two Post Malone concerts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's recent increase in coal power capacity is not a reversal of its climate policy but a strategic move to support its rapidly expanding renewable energy sector. Despite adding a record amount of solar power, China faces challenges with energy curtailment, where clean power is generated but cannot be used, and reduced hydropower due to droughts. In this context, coal plants function as a crucial backup system, ensuring grid stability during peak demand and preventing blackouts. This approach provides grid operators the confidence to continue integrating massive amounts of renewables without risking energy security.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for instructing broadcasters to avoid showing any crowd dissent against Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. The author argues this move is cowardly and hypocritical, contrasting it with the USTA's previous willingness to televise other disruptions, such as climate protests. The article contends that by attempting to shield a political figure from public disapproval, the USTA is sacrificing the event's authentic, unfiltered character and capitulating to political pressure. This censorship is seen as undermining the democratic expression of fans and the tournament's history of breaking barriers.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the online marketplace Vinted, started the company after realizing she had too many clothes when moving to a smaller apartment. In 2008, she shared her idea for a website to sell unwanted clothing with a friend, Justas Janauskas, and they quickly launched a basic site that gained popularity through word-of-mouth. After expanding into Germany, the platform grew into the billion-dollar business known today, becoming Lithuania's first tech 'unicorn'. Despite early mistakes, such as introducing a commission fee that nearly bankrupted the company, Vinted recovered and became profitable by focusing on a user-friendly, fee-free model for sellers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, has been targeted in what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as Russia's largest drone and missile attack of the war. The barrage involved over 800 munitions, with a strike damaging the roof and upper floors of the country's main cabinet building. Across the country, the widespread attacks resulted in at least eight civilian deaths and 59 injuries, impacting multiple regions including Zaporizhzhia and Odesa. The assault prompted renewed calls from Ukrainian leaders for increased international military assistance to bolster their air defenses against such large-scale aerial bombardments.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, a Christian prayer, following a new state law allowing time for religious observance. This stance has drawn sharp criticism, particularly given Paxton's past actions in 2017, when he raised concerns about Muslim students using a classroom for prayer. Critics argue this represents a double standard and an unconstitutional endorsement of Christianity over other faiths, aligning with a broader Christian nationalist agenda. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that if schools set aside time for prayer, it must apply equally to students of all faiths.</p>

          <p>William Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) appointed by Donald Trump, has taken the unusual step of personally making a criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Former officials and experts describe this action as highly irregular, as such investigations are typically handled by the agency's independent Office of Inspector General. The accusations, which Cook denies and calls a "clerical error," claim she misrepresented her primary residence on mortgage applications. This move is seen by many as politically motivated, providing a basis for Trump's attempts to remove Cook from the Federal Reserve board.</p>

Rayner's departure triggered a major reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which saw several key appointments. Burnham suggested the upcoming contest for the separate role of deputy party leader is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and advocated for a candidate from the north of England to counter a "London centricity."

          <p>This article argues that President Donald Trump's second-term economic strategy increasingly resembles the state-controlled, populist policies of Argentina's Juan Perón. The analysis points to Trump's use of high tariffs, personal dealmaking with corporate leaders, and direct government intervention, such as taking equity stakes in companies like Intel and U.S. Steel. These tactics, described as a form of "import substitution industrialization," mirror Peronist policies that historically led to uncompetitive industries and economic instability in Argentina. The author warns that this centralization of economic power based on personal whims rather than consistent rules is moving the U.S. away from market capitalism.</p>

          <p>Despite massive investment and soaring stock valuations for tech giants, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence is not yet delivering the expected productivity boosts, raising concerns of an AI bubble. A recent rigorous study found that experienced software developers were actually 20% slower when using AI tools, highlighting a "capability-reliability gap" where AI systems lack the consistency required for real-world applications. Many businesses using generative AI report no tangible impact on earnings, and economists have found little evidence of AI-driven job displacement.

Interest may still accrue, particularly during forbearance, which can substantially increase a borrower's total debt over time.

          <h2>Philosophers and Scientists Debate Whether Animals Have a Right to Privacy from Human Surveillance</h2>

          <p>The proliferation of surveillance technology, from satellite imagery to home security cameras, is making it increasingly difficult for animals to hide from human observation, sparking a debate about animal privacy. Philosophers argue that some animals exhibit behaviors suggesting a desire for privacy, such as seeking seclusion or altering their actions when they know they are being watched. Constant monitoring can cause stress, disrupt natural behaviors, and lead to social breakdown in crowded conditions. While we cannot know an animal's internal state, the article suggests that affording them moral decency may sometimes require not seeing them at all, especially for pets and zoo animals with limited autonomy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Warns Trump's Deportation Push Could Lead to First-Ever U.S. Population Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's aggressive deportation campaign, combined with the United States' low birth rate, could lead to the nation's first-ever recorded population decline in 2025, according to demographic analysis. With natural increase (births minus deaths) at a historic low, the country relies on net immigration to grow. A significant reduction in immigration could shrink the population, creating severe labor shortages in critical sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, where immigrants play a disproportionate role. This could lead to higher prices for food and housing, and increased strain on the healthcare system as the nation ages.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms, affects over half of Americans by age 40 and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for early intervention, including lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. For those with readings of 140/90 or higher, starting treatment with medication is advised to prevent long-term damage. Experts stress that catching and treating high blood pressure early can add years of healthy life expectancy.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of more military and other non-military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's plan to end the costly reliance on hotels, which currently house over 32,000 people. The new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is expected to announce specific proposals soon, likely expanding on the use of existing sites like the former RAF Wethersfield. The move comes as the government faces pressure to manage a record number of small boat crossings in the English Channel and reduce the £15.3 billion projected cost of accommodation contracts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic policies, characterized by aggressive tariffs, direct intervention in corporate affairs, and challenges to the Federal Reserve's independence, are dismantling the long-standing "Washington consensus" of free-market capitalism. His administration has taken government stakes in tech companies, demanded revenue shares, and sought to remove key economic officials, creating a chaotic and unpredictable policy environment. While the post-2008 financial crisis had already weakened faith in laissez-faire principles, Trump is accelerating the shift toward a more state-controlled model. This maelstrom is creating radical uncertainty and risks leaving the U.S. economic model unrecognizable, with potential long-term consequences for its credibility.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has announced his resignation following intense pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The decision comes after the party's ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house of parliament in a historic July election defeat. Ishiba, who had been in office for less than a year, initially resisted calls to step down but ultimately conceded ahead of a party vote that would have served as a no-confidence motion. The LDP will now hold a leadership election to choose his successor, who will face the challenge of governing without a majority in both houses.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, the price of gold has surged to record highs, gaining approximately 35% this year. Investors are increasingly turning to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset, with central bank purchases and geopolitical tensions further bolstering demand. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for most investors to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than owning physical bullion. They generally advise limiting such investments to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citizens in Syria are enduring a severe cash crunch, forcing them to wait in long lines for hours at banks to withdraw minimal amounts of money, often just a fraction of their monthly salaries. The liquidity crisis has intensified since the new rebel-led government took power, imposing strict withdrawal limits that are strangling an already devastated economy. While authorities have promoted e-payment solutions, the lack of physical banknotes persists, fueling a black market for currency exchange. This banking chaos has become a daily struggle for millions, hindering their ability to buy basic necessities and conduct business.</p>

Unlike the more common language-affecting form of FTD, Marc's condition has primarily damaged the brain's frontal lobes, altering his personality, emotional regulation, and ability to process information. The story details the initial, confusing symptoms of hostility and irrational behavior, the difficult path to diagnosis, and the couple's current reality of navigating daily life. Despite losing his sense of self, Marc retains some ability to articulate his internal experience of the disease, offering a rare window into its devastating effects.</p>

          <p>A district judge in Utah has thrown out the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved the creation of an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers later gutted the commission and passed their own heavily gerrymandered map. The rejected map strategically divided Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four Republican-dominated districts, ensuring GOP victories. The court has ordered the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, representing a significant victory for anti-gerrymandering advocates in the state.</p>
