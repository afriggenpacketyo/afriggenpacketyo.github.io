          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges, including one count of distributing ketamine resulting in the death of actor Matthew Perry. The Justice Department announced the plea agreement, which avoids a trial for Sangha, who was one of five defendants charged in the case. Perry was found dead in his home in October 2023, with the medical examiner ruling that ketamine was the primary cause of death. According to prosecutors, Sangha was a prolific drug dealer who supplied Perry with the fatal dose just days before his passing.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling to as low as $114,706 after reaching a new all-time high of over $124,000 last week. The downturn is part of a wider cryptocurrency market sell-off, with over $530 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours due to macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data that has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. Ether also saw a decline, while comments from the Treasury Secretary regarding the U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve added to investor disappointment. Despite the pullback, some analysts view the correction as a healthy cooldown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is reintroducing legislation that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers, including federal agents, to wear masks or other personal disguises while on duty. The move was prompted by an incident where ICE agents appeared at a press conference held by Governor Gavin Newsom wearing ski masks, which Wiener described as an intimidation tactic by "Trump’s secret police." The proposed bill aims to increase transparency and accountability by requiring officers to be identifiable, mandating that names or badge numbers be visible on uniforms. Wiener is also considered a potential candidate to succeed Nancy Pelosi in her congressional district.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, has intensified into a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. While the storm is not forecast to make landfall in the United States, its path between Bermuda and the East Coast will generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents throughout the week. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, urging residents and visitors to heed local advisories and avoid the ocean. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for Hatteras and Ocracoke islands due to the risk of severe flooding.</p>

This investment follows recent 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, which have caused TeraWulf's stock to surge approximately 90% over the last week.

          <p>Friends, family, and colleagues gathered at Riverside Church in New York to celebrate the life of veteran journalist and educator David Diaz, who passed away in March. Diaz, remembered as a "reporter's reporter," had a distinguished career telling the story of New York from the 1970s onward, working for both NBC and CBS News New York. Speakers at the memorial highlighted his professionalism, mentorship to younger journalists, and his deep connection to the city's communities. A proud native of Puerto Rico, Diaz was also recognized as a trailblazer for Latino journalists in New York media.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, 2025, marking the unofficial end of summer for many. The holiday originated from the labor movement in the late 19th century, which fought for better working conditions and rights. While federal offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed, most major retailers like Target and Walmart, as well as grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open, though some may have limited hours. Costco is a notable exception and will be closed for the day.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, suffered a brief but widespread network outage, with thousands of users reporting service interruptions. This marks the second significant outage for the service in two weeks, following a more prolonged disruption in late July that was attributed to an internal software failure. The incident occurred on the same day SpaceX successfully launched another batch of satellites to expand its constellation, which now consists of over 7,000 operational units. The company, which provides internet to over six million users globally, did not immediately comment on the cause of the latest disruption.</p>

          <p>Iran is facing a severe water crisis, with officials warning that millions of residents could run out of water within weeks. The impending shortage is the result of a prolonged drought and extreme summer heat, which have been exacerbated by governmental mismanagement of the nation's dams and water resources. This combination of environmental and administrative failures has left water levels dangerously low, threatening the stability and daily life of a significant portion of the Iranian population. The situation highlights the critical impact of climate change compounded by inadequate infrastructure planning and response.</p>

          <p>The progressive cable news network MSNBC is being rebranded to "MS NOW," which reportedly stands for "My Source for News, Opinion, and the World." This change comes as parent company Comcast spins off MSNBC and other cable properties into a new, separate company, a move mirrored by Warner Bros. with CNN. While presented as a business decision in a declining cable market, the article suggests the rebranding also serves to distance the networks from their corporate parents, who may fear political retribution from the Trump administration. The name change for MSNBC is a reversal from an earlier plan, possibly to create more separation from the NBC brand.</p>

Haliva, who resigned over the intelligence failures leading to the Hamas attack, also admitted that Israeli intelligence had long underestimated the threat from Gaza.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability as new tariffs take effect. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across large groups of items rather than tracking individual item costs, it is slower to reflect sudden cost increases, potentially overstating profits in the short term. This accounting lag means that the initial financial reports from these companies may not fully capture the negative impact of the tariffs. Over time, the figures would normalize, but the short-term discrepancy complicates assessments of the tariffs' economic effects. (not investment advice)</p>

This updated narrative is powered by a string of hit songs from producer Max Martin, originally performed by artists like Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and the Backstreet Boys. With a witty book by David West Read of "Schitt's Creek" fame, the production is praised for its clever integration of pop anthems and its focus on 21st-century themes of empowerment and identity.</p>

          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own restrictions, typically capping buyers at around 80 to 85 years old. Annuities provide a guaranteed income stream for retirement, but the timing of the purchase significantly affects costs and payouts. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s to mid-60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. However, purchasing an immediate annuity later in life, such as in one's 70s or 80s, can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, though this strategy carries risks related to health and product availability.

          <p>A reserve police officer in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has agreed to voluntarily leave the country. The officer, Jon Luke Evans, is a citizen of Jamaica. His arrest created a dispute between local officials and federal authorities, as the town claimed it had verified his legal authorization to work through the federal E-Verify system prior to his employment. An ICE representative confirmed that a judge has granted Evans's request for voluntary departure, concluding a case that highlights the complexities and potential pitfalls of immigration enforcement and employment verification processes.</p>

Other notable additions include "tradwife," reflecting a social media trend of embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," describing a small group of powerful male tech leaders. Lexicographers noted that they only add words they believe will have lasting power in the English language.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that, on average, American wages have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, meaning the typical worker's purchasing power has decreased. This finding aligns with public sentiment, as a majority of Americans report their incomes have not kept up with the rising cost of living. The analysis indicates that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind than others. In contrast, workers in fields that saw a post-pandemic demand surge, such as leisure, hospitality, and healthcare, have experienced wage growth that outpaced inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit. Dominion alleged that Newsmax knowingly spread false claims that the company's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. The settlement was reached before the case could go to trial, following a judge's ruling that Newsmax had indeed defamed Dominion. This resolution follows a similar, much larger $787.5 million settlement paid by Fox News to Dominion in 2023 for airing the same baseless conspiracy theories about the election.</p>

According to the Kiel Institute, the United States has committed approximately $130.6 billion, making it the largest single-country donor. However, when combined, European nations and EU institutions have collectively spent more, contributing around $165.7 billion in military, financial, and humanitarian aid. The report clarifies that aid from both the U.S. and Europe has consisted of a mix of grants and loans, countering claims that only European contributions are structured as repayable loans.</p>

Doak, who has signed a five-year contract, sought the move to secure more regular first-team football after making only 10 appearances for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022. The sale is part of a profitable summer for Liverpool, which has generated significant funds from selling several 'homegrown' or development players.

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued an urgent safety warning about counterfeit versions of the popular Labubu dolls, which pose a serious choking risk to young children. These knockoffs, sometimes called "Lafufus," are often small enough to fit in a child's mouth and can break into smaller pieces, creating a significant hazard. The agency advises consumers to immediately stop using any fake dolls and to purchase authentic products only from reputable sellers. To identify genuine Labubu dolls, consumers should look for a holographic Pop Mart sticker, a scannable QR code, and specific design details like the number of teeth.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated his opinion that the artificial intelligence market is currently in an investment bubble, characterized by widespread overexcitement among investors. While affirming his belief that AI is a profoundly important technological shift, he compared the current dynamic to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where a "kernel of truth" led to massive, unsustainable speculation. His comments echo warnings from other financial experts who have raised concerns that investment in AI is moving too quickly and that many companies are overvalued. Despite these concerns, Altman's own company, OpenAI, is reportedly preparing a stock sale that would value it at roughly $500 billion.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the medical journal JAMA has found that the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, whose members were all fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June, had a historically low rate of financial conflicts of interest. The annual reported conflict rate for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) declined from over 42% in 2000 to just 5% in 2024. Kennedy had justified the dismissals by citing a 2007 report about conflicts on the panel. The new data suggests that significant progress had been made in reducing such conflicts, with personal income-related ties being below 1% since 2016.</p>
