          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, 33, required assistance for two 135-pound bench press repetitions at a Brooklyn Men’s Day event. This display drew criticism from political rivals, including Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who questioned his ability to lead the city. Mamdani, who also participated in other activities, thanked organizers and expressed his mayoral aspirations. The event, hosted by "500 Men Making a Difference," focused on community building and social mobility for Black men.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks shares experienced a 2% drop on Monday, attributed primarily to a Bloomberg report indicating the company is scaling back production at its five U.S. plants from seven days a week to five, starting in January. This move, potentially a cost-cutting measure or a response to lower demand, follows six consecutive quarters of negative same-store sales. Competitive concerns also arose after Keurig Dr Pepper announced its acquisition of Peet's Coffee's parent company. The article suggests this operational efficiency could be beneficial despite the initial stock reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign, part of a broader brand refresh, led to significant public backlash and a nearly $100 million drop in the restaurant's value. Marketing experts criticized the move for abandoning the company's established folksy image and story, which resonated with loyal customers. The removal of "Uncle Herschel" and the namesake barrel from the logo was seen as severing ties to its traditional roots. The company acknowledged its communication missteps, affirming that its old-timey vibe and Uncle Herschel in marketing would remain.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite a recent meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs.

Buffett's comments followed a new partnership announcement between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX for coast-to-coast rail services, aimed at improving freight movement without an acquisition.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the Department of Justice will sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's efforts to redraw a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map. This move contrasts sharply with Trump's recent praise for Republican Texas legislators, who passed a new map designed to give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races. Newsom quickly responded with "BRING IT." The California redistricting push is seen as a counterweight to the Texas effort, with both actions highlighting intense partisan battles over electoral maps, which typically occur after each decennial U.S. Census.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Second Term Actions Raise Concerns Over Rule of Law and Politicization of Justice</h2>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic analyzes the actions of Donald Trump's second presidency, suggesting a systematic move away from the rule of law towards arbitrary personal rule. It highlights instances such as the FBI raid on former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home, which Trump denied advance knowledge of while hinting at his authority as "chief law-enforcement officer." The piece argues that Trump is purging the federal law enforcement apparatus, replacing rule-obeying public servants with loyalists, and that this politicization of government institutions poses long-term challenges to the American system, regardless of future elections.</p>

          <p>China Evergrande, once the nation's second-largest developer, has been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking another step in its downfall and the broader crisis in China's property market. The company, with over $340 billion in debts, faced liquidation after failing to provide a viable restructuring plan. Its collapse, triggered by Chinese regulators' crackdown on developer borrowing, led to widespread defaults and suspended construction, significantly impacting China's economy. The anemic housing market continues to crimp consumer spending, despite government efforts to stabilize the sector through lending, subsidies, and relaxed housing purchase restrictions.

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García was detained by ICE in Baltimore, just days after his release from criminal custody, facing potential deportation to Uganda. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, filed a new lawsuit challenging his confinement and the proposed deportation, arguing it's a punitive measure and unconstitutional coercion. Ábrego, who previously received federal protection against deportation to El Salvador, was mistakenly deported there in March and allegedly tortured. His detention has sparked protests and strong criticism from a Maryland Congressman, who called it a "total abuse of power" by the Trump administration.</p>

The proposed act would require listings to include details like intended hire dates and previous posting frequency, with fines for violators.
