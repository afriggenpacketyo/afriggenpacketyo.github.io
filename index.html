          <h2>US Birth Rate Experiences Slight Uptick Amidst Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 00:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CDC data indicates a 1% increase in US births in 2024, totaling around 3.6 million, marking a slight rebound after a prolonged decline since the 2008 recession. Demographers caution against interpreting this as a definitive trend reversal, citing ongoing economic uncertainty, housing costs, and childcare expenses impacting family decisions. The report reveals a record-low number of teenage births alongside an increase in births among women aged 40-44, with Hispanic and Asian women contributing significantly to the rise. The Biden administration is reportedly considering proposals to encourage married heterosexual couples to have children, though experts doubt modest policies will substantially alter fertility rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Heightened US regulatory scrutiny, spurred by President Trump's "America First Investment Policy" memo, is raising concerns about the potential delisting of Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. The memo calls for reviews of US investments in Chinese entities and renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies, potentially leading to faster delisting than anticipated. The House Select Committee on China is also pressuring investment banks to withdraw from underwriting Chinese IPOs, adding to the regulatory pressure. Despite these concerns, the White House has signaled a potential easing of tensions, with Treasury Secretary Bessent expecting a de-escalation of the trade war with China in the near future.</p>

          <p>Netflix's "Stranger Things" franchise has expanded to Broadway with "Stranger Things: The First Shadow," a prequel set in 1959 Hawkins. The production combines cinematic fluidity with stage dynamism, attracting a younger demographic to the theater. However, the play's plot is considered convoluted and rushed, attempting to condense an entire season of the series into a single performance. Despite impressive visual effects and a talented cast, the narrative gaps and reliance on franchise mythology may leave some viewers struggling to follow the story.</p>

          <p>More travelers are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services to finance their trips, splitting the cost of flights, hotels, and cruises into installments.

The letter, addressed to key Trump administration officials, highlights the potential for production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies within the automotive supply chain.

          <p>Chinese energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with US providers due to the escalating US-China trade war. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since February, when Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs. Chinese buyers hold numerous long-term procurement contracts with US producers, but these agreements are now at risk due to the trade dispute. In the short term, contracted volumes can be resold to other markets, but the long-term implications for the US-China energy trade remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>China is seeking to enhance its innovation capabilities by addressing the persistent problem of academic misconduct. A recent opinion piece in People's Daily highlighted the need for stricter penalties for academic dishonesty, which undermines research integrity and hinders technological advancement. The call for stronger enforcement comes as China prioritizes technological self-sufficiency and innovation in response to increasing competition with the United States. The country is attempting to crack down on academic misconduct in order to ensure fair competition in the sector.</p>

          <p>At least two dozen people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting a popular beauty spot in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack took place in Pahalgam, a picturesque town in the Himalayas often described as the "Switzerland of India". The region's chief minister, Omar Abdullah, said the attack was "much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years". Reports suggest that there are a large number of wounded, with some in critical condition. US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen were among world leaders who condemned the attacks.</p>

          <p>Campaigners are raising concerns that Instagram continues to pose serious risks to children, despite the introduction of new Teen Accounts designed to provide greater protection. Researchers were able to create accounts using fake birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. The findings coincide with the upcoming release of Ofcom's children's safety codes, which will outline rules for platforms under the Online Safety Act. Meta maintains that its Teen Accounts offer built-in protections, but critics argue that the platform is not adequately safeguarding young users.</p>
