          <p>Pfizer announced a significant deal to acquire weight loss drug developer Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, including future contingent payments, as it intensifies efforts to secure a share in the booming obesity drug market. This strategic acquisition follows a series of setbacks for Pfizer in developing its own obesity treatments, with prior candidates being scrapped due to safety concerns. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed positive early-stage trial results, with analysts projecting over $5 billion in combined peak annual sales. The deal, expected to close by year-end, is poised to accelerate Pfizer's presence and competitiveness against established rivals, leveraging its deep cardiometabolic experience and manufacturing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed from her role as patron of Julia's House, a children's hospice charity, following the emergence of a 2011 email where she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." This correspondence appeared to privately apologize for her public rejection of Epstein, contradicting her earlier statements calling her involvement a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the duchess explained the email was sent under a threat from Epstein to sue her for defamation, reiterating her regret over any association. The charity decided it was inappropriate for her to continue her patronage given the information shared.</p>

          <p>China achieved a significant military milestone with the successful launch of its J-35 stealth fighter jet from the Fujian aircraft carrier, marking the first time this advanced aircraft has taken off from such a vessel. This landmark operation confirms the Fujian's attainment of electromagnetic catapult and recovery capabilities, representing a major technological breakthrough in China's aircraft carrier development. The J-35 is now recognized as the world’s second carrier-based stealth fighter, following the Lockheed Martin F-35 series. This development substantially enhances the power and operational reach of China’s naval air wings, signaling a new era for its maritime defense capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany faces considerable challenges in its aspiration to become a global leader in autonomous driving technology, despite ongoing pilot projects and Level 4 autonomy authorization. High car ownership rates, a powerful taxi lobby, and an already robust public transit network limit market entry for new mobility solutions. Many government-funded initiatives have faltered once financial support ceased, and German manufacturers prioritize mature systems, leading to slower deployment compared to other nations. Projects like NeMo Paderborn are innovating with "swarm" cabs and convoys for rural areas, but a nationwide rollout requires substantial government backing and integration into public transport to overcome these hurdles.</p>

Critics argue this represents a dangerous politicization of the Department of Justice, reminiscent of the Nixon era, and undermines the independence of legal processes. The article expresses concern over the erosion of bipartisan commitment to neutral justice and the potential for lasting harm to the American legal system.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The project involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, potentially increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While welcomed by the Chancellor for economic benefits, the plan faces strong opposition from environmental groups who argue it ignores climate science and will exacerbate pollution. Stricter noise controls and public transport targets have been agreed upon to mitigate local impact, though critics are considering a judicial review.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping indicates a shift towards a "managed rivalry" between the two global powers, prioritizing accommodation over escalating tensions. Despite a history of strategic competition and the Trump administration's imposition of high tariffs, both nations acknowledge their profound mutual economic dependence. This pragmatic acceptance is deemed essential for global stability, as an all-out conflict would be mutually devastating. The conversation, described as "pragmatic, positive and constructive" by China’s People’s Daily, suggests an evolving framework for cautious competition in their economically asymmetric relationship.</p>

Despite US President Trump's efforts to broker peace, Moscow shows no signs of accepting concessions, continuing its military assault.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage unveiled plans to replace indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for migrants with five-year visas, requiring reapplication based on stricter criteria like higher salary thresholds and English proficiency. The policy aims to address the "Boriswave" of post-Brexit migration and is projected to save over £234 billion, a figure disputed by other parties. Reform asserts the changes would lead to mass deportations of welfare-dependent migrants and align the UK with countries like the US and UAE.

India, a key customer, consistently receives over 600,000 barrels per day from Saudi Arabia, remaining one of its top suppliers. Despite India's long-standing conflict with Pakistan, the agreement is understood as serving national priorities.

          <p>This article explores the pervasive self-help industry, questioning whether its focus on individual betterment might inadvertently be making people feel worse by fostering isolation. Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro, drawing from her book "Promise Land," argues that while the appeal of self-optimization is strong, the obsession with productivity and individual improvement often neglects the crucial aspect of community. She suggests that by solely focusing on "self-help," individuals miss opportunities to strengthen relationships and build communal support, which are vital for well-being. The article posits that while some self-help can be beneficial, an overemphasis on it can detract from collective human connection.</p>

Experts caution that autism's causes are complex and not easily attributed to a single factor.</p>

          <p>A delegation of US lawmakers from the House of Representatives, led by Democrat Adam Smith, met with China's premier and defense minister, aiming to re-establish military communication channels. This marks the first reported House visit since 2019, following a 2023 Senate visit, as both countries seek to recalibrate their bilateral relationship across diplomatic, economic, and security issues. Beijing had previously halted contacts in 2022 in protest of a visit to Taiwan by former House speaker Nancy Pelosi. The US delegation expressed a willingness to open lines of communication on peace and security, with China hoping the visit fosters greater understanding of its military.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the pervasive myth that promoting two-parent families will significantly reduce racial inequality among Black youth. Her research demonstrates that Black children raised in two-parent households still face considerably greater struggles than their white counterparts from similar family structures, performing only as well as white children from single-parent homes. Cross argues that the singular focus and substantial federal spending on marriage promotion programs are economically costly and divert resources from more effective structural interventions. The article advocates for a shift in narrative and policy to address systemic resource gaps and structural racism, rather than solely focusing on family composition.</p>

The discovery includes a unique ring-shaped ornament adorned with 37 smaller rings, described as the "most complete and complicated" of its type in Scotland.

          <p>This article clarifies the essential differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, crucial for investors seeking to diversify portfolios. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering real-time pricing, while mutual funds transact directly with the fund at day-end prices. Critically, ETFs are generally more tax-efficient due to "in-kind" transfers that avoid capital gains distributions, a significant advantage for taxable accounts. They also tend to have lower expense ratios. However, mutual funds offer a broader selection and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans, meaning investors may not always have a choice.
