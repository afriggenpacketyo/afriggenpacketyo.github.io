        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Seattle Mariners have initiated Major League Baseball's trade deadline action by acquiring productive first baseman Josh Naylor from the Arizona Diamondbacks. Naylor, who boasts a .292 batting average, 11 home runs, and 59 RBI this season, significantly strengthens the Mariners' lineup as they actively push for a postseason spot. In return, the Diamondbacks received minor league pitchers Brandyn Garcia and Ashton Izzi, a strategic move as they look to shed players from their disappointing 50-53 season. This article details the immediate impact of this key transaction, setting a precedent for further trade activity before the July 31 deadline and highlighting the Mariners' ambition in the American League West race.</p>

          <p>Dozens of people were accidentally dosed with THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, after consuming food from Famous Yeti's Pizza in Stoughton, Wisconsin, as reported by the CDC. The pizzeria mistakenly used THC-infused oil from a shared kitchen, believing it was plain canola oil, to prepare dough for various food items. This incident led to 85 reported illnesses, including dizziness and anxiety, with some requiring hospitalization and positive THC tests. Investigations confirmed the situation was unintentional, and the restaurant promptly reopened after a brief closure, underscoring the importance of clear labeling in shared facilities.</p>

They face steep legal and political hurdles in mounting a tit-for-tat response, despite some governors expressing willingness to consider mirroring these moves.
