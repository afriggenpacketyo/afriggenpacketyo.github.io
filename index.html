          <p>Japan's core inflation rate surged to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, intensifying pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to combat rising prices. The figure, excluding fresh food costs, exceeded economists' expectations and April's reading. Rice prices experienced a significant spike, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. While headline inflation was slightly lower than the previous month, it marked the 38th consecutive month above the BOJ's 2% target, with the central bank closely monitoring the "core-core" inflation rate, which also climbed, despite forecasting that inflation would wane moving forward due to a deceleration in the economy.

          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded from "good" to "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) due to failings that pose a significant risk to women and babies.

Concerns raised by staff and patients, including instances of avoidable injury or death of babies, were substantiated by the inspections.

The exact nature of the facility's protection is not fully known, and the weapon has never been used. Joe Cirincione argues that attacking Iran's nuclear enrichment program would cripple but not eliminate their nuclear weapons capability, as Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, and resources to rebuild.
