            <p>Deborah Sampson, a Massachusetts native, disguised herself as a man named Robert Shurtlieff to enlist in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. She served for nearly two years, participating in skirmishes and even extracting a musket ball from her own thigh to maintain her secret. After contracting a fever, her true identity was discovered by a doctor, Barnabas Binney, who helped her receive an honorable discharge and a military pension with assistance from Paul Revere. Sampson's bravery and service led to her being recognized as the official heroine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the passage of the Deborah Sampson Act, improving healthcare access for women veterans.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary block on the deportation of Venezuelan migrants held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This decision came after the ACLU argued that the migrants were being deported without due process, specifically without the opportunity to argue their case in court. The ACLU cited concerns that the migrants would be sent to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, similar to previous deportations under the Act. The Supreme Court's order prevents the administration from deporting these individuals until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting.</p>

            <p>A poll by a teaching union in the UK reveals that social media influencers, particularly Andrew Tate, are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism among students. Teachers reported instances of boys refusing to listen to female teachers and expressing views that women are property. The Department for Education acknowledges the damaging impact of dangerous influencers and is working to support teachers in addressing these issues. The union plans to debate motions to safeguard children from far-right and populist movements that have shifted recruitment online.</p>

            <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a personal trainer, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving after a high-speed chase with police resulted in a crash that injured seven officers. The pursuit began when police noticed a defective rear light on his BMW, and Azarbonyad, who was on a first date, sped away due to having no insurance and his date possessing cannabis. The crash involved five police vehicles and another car, with an unmarked police car hitting Azarbonyad's vehicle at approximately 80 mph. Azarbonyad was granted conditional bail and is scheduled to be sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's pardons of individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot, many are now being welcomed as honored guests at local Republican events. Some are considering running for office, capitalizing on their newfound status as perceived patriots among a segment of the pro-Trump base. This trend highlights a growing acceptance of political violence on the right, raising concerns about the mainstreaming of actions previously deemed criminal. The AP's report indicates that at least two dozen local Republican groups have platformed Jan. 6 rioters in recent months.</p>

While Musk dismisses the report as gossip, his actions and views raise concerns about gendered double standards and his influence on government and society.

The ministry stated that the measures harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, disrupt global supply chains, and violate WTO rules. The US finalized the port fees as part of efforts to bolster its domestic shipbuilding industry and curb Chinese dominance in the sector. Chinese operators will face fees of US$50 per net ton, increasing to US$140 by 2028, while Chinese-built vessels will face lower fees.</p>

            <p>According to experts, treating baby babble as conversation is a key factor in raising successful readers, as strong reading skills in elementary school are a predictor of long-term success. Parents who engage in "serve and return" interactions, asking questions and waiting for answers, talking about letter sounds, playing with words, and seizing readable moments throughout the day are giving their children a significant advantage. These practices help build a foundation for language development, vocabulary, and phonemic awareness, all essential for reading comprehension.</p>

This uncertainty is impacting consumer confidence, with concerns about job security and future inflation.

To prepare, consumers should prioritize paying down high-interest debt, building an emergency fund, and considering strategic purchases while remaining cautious about panic buying.

            <p>Proposed budget cuts that would end NASA's Mars sample return program could allow China to take the lead in space exploration. The White House's recommendation to halt funding for the mission would leave China's Tianwen-3 mission as the sole contender to bring Martian material to Earth by 2031. This move could weaken US leadership in space and prompt international partners to reconsider their cooperation with NASA. Experts warn that the decision introduces substantial uncertainties for the US and its allies.</p>

            <p>Hobby inflation, or the increasing cost of recreational activities, is making leisure pursuits less accessible to the working and middle classes. The rising prices of hobbies such as shooting, fishing, and bourbon collecting are driven by factors like supply-chain issues, increased popularity, and tariffs. This trend has social consequences, as hobbies create communities that connect people from different backgrounds. The growing exclusivity of leisure activities can lead to increased social isolation and intolerance of difference.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece reflects on the use of a Chicago Bulls hat as a sign of gang affiliation by the Prince George's County Police Department, revealing the oversimplification of identity and the potential for bias in law enforcement. The author, who recalls seeing Bulls hats all over the world, expresses concern that an ordinary item can be misconstrued as evidence of criminal activity. The case involves a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported based on the assumption that his Bulls hat indicated gang membership.</p>

The call comes amid concerns that the administration may target philanthropic organizations that support causes it opposes.
