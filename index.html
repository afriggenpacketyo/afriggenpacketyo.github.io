          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a downturn following renewed trade tensions between China and the U.S., as both nations imposed new restrictions and exchanged accusations. China's Ministry of Commerce stated it was "not afraid of" a trade war after President Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a response to China's rare earth minerals export controls. This escalation, which wiped out $2 trillion in market value, signals China's potential push for greater concessions. Trump later softened his tone on Truth Social, suggesting a resolution.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Colin Hanks described past media interviews focusing on comedian John Candy's weight as "heartbreaking" and "soul-crushing," noting such questioning would be unacceptable today. Hanks, director of the documentary "John Candy: I Like Me," revealed Candy's discomfort and anxiety over these personal inquiries, which led to unhealthy eating habits. The documentary, produced with Ryan Reynolds and Candy's children, explores the comedian's life, career, and private struggles, including his efforts to improve his health before his death at 43.</p>

          <p>Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction, with Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan emphasizing international cooperation for the immense task. This comes as former US President Donald Trump declared the "war is over" in Gaza, expressing belief in the ceasefire's durability during his travel to a peace summit in Egypt. Trump's comments were made ahead of an expected release of 20 living hostages by Hamas in exchange for 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The two-year conflict has caused extensive destruction and over 66,000 Palestinian deaths.</p>

Veterans like Jonathan Giba face extended waits for essential services as VA programs assisting with jobs and transition are halted. With over 700,000 federal employees on unpaid leave nationwide and thousands more working without pay, the shutdown is causing widespread anxiety and economic strain. Local businesses are suffering, and a USDA service center has closed, highlighting the deep effects on communities, particularly in states already facing federal job cuts.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced the "war is over" in Gaza while en route to Israel for the expected release of hostages under a ceasefire agreement. He praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar's mediation efforts, predicting the ceasefire would hold and a "Board of Peace" would oversee Gaza's future. The peace plan's first phase involves Hamas releasing 20 living and 28 deceased Israeli hostages, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees, alongside increased aid to Gaza. Subsequent phases, including governance and Hamas disarmament, remain complex.</p>

          <p>Former national security official David Feith warns that Chinese entities acquiring land near U.S. military bases and operating cryptocurrency mines pose significant national security threats. These acquisitions could facilitate espionage or sabotage of critical infrastructure, such as the electric grid. While Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland is under 1%, its strategic locations are concerning, prompting 29 states to limit or ban such purchases. The Trump administration plans increased transparency and penalties, viewing these actions as part of China's preparation to challenge the U.S. military.</p>

With 13 million Syrians displaced and over half a million dead from civil war, he emphasizes the need for international support for the estimated $600-900 billion reconstruction.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates adults lose about half their friends every seven years due to shifting life stages and priorities, leading to "relational loneliness." Experts like Dr. Marisa Franco and Claire Cohen emphasize honest communication and embracing "messy" lives to maintain connections. Cohen's experience, where transparency reaffirmed a friendship, highlights the importance of speaking up. Psychologists suggest integrating friends into daily routines, prioritizing in-person meetings over virtual ones, and reframing social anxieties to remember the happiness friendships bring. Trusting that bonds are "flexible and not fragile" and taking risks to rekindle connections are key to sustained adult friendships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to measure stress levels, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can indicate acute stress and monitor recovery. This non-invasive technique, which could be a "game changer" in stress research, works because stress diverts blood flow away from the nose to other areas like eyes and ears. Researchers observed nose temperature drops of 3-6 degrees in volunteers during a stressful public speaking and mental arithmetic test. This method holds potential for monitoring stress in individuals unable to communicate, such as babies, and even in non-human apes.</p>

This follows Volkswagen's earlier settlement in the "dieselgate" scandal. Lawyers for the motorists argue they were deceived about environmental friendliness and that the vehicles continue to emit dangerous pollution. The companies deny the accusations, asserting their systems are technically and legally justifiable. A judgment is not expected until summer 2026.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at Willie's Bar and Grill on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, resulted in four fatalities and at least 20 injuries early Sunday morning.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met, agreeing to be "partners" rather than "rivals" and committing to resolve border disputes. Modi emphasized India's pursuit of "strategic autonomy," avoiding a "third country lens" for bilateral relations, a subtle jab at the US. Both leaders envision Sino-Indian ties as crucial for a multipolar world and an "Asian century," resuming direct flights after five years. This diplomatic overture signals India's effort to reset fraught ties with China and forge an eastern coalition, balancing its position amidst an increasingly tough stance from the US.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts backup quarterback Anthony Richardson was hospitalized with an orbital fracture after an unusual accident during pre-game warm-ups. An elastic exercise band, meant to be contained, whipped into his face, causing the injury. Richardson, a 23-year-old highly-drafted player, has faced inconsistency and injuries throughout his NFL career, with Daniel Jones currently starting for the Colts. This incident adds to the team's injury woes, as they also lost their No. 1 cornerback, Charvarius Ward, to a concussion during warm-ups for Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals.</p>

The plant, currently not producing electricity, has relied on emergency diesel generators for nearly three weeks to cool fuel and prevent a meltdown. Both sides blame each other for the outage, while the IAEA urges restraint to maintain nuclear safety.

Badenoch criticized the government's shifting accounts and suggested an appeasement of Beijing, questioning the role of Starmer's national security advisor.
