          <p>The UK government plans to expand large asylum seeker sites like Wethersfield air base to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029, aiming to save Â£1bn.  This decision has drawn criticism from local residents and refugee rights groups who argue that the sites provide inadequate living conditions. The Home Office defends the plan as a more sustainable and cost-effective approach to asylum accommodation. The plan is controversial and faces significant opposition.</p>
