          <p>As President Trump's tax agenda moves forward, policy experts are closely watching key issues that could affect millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, but significant changes are possible before the final vote. With Republican control of the White House and Congress, the package could pass without Democratic support through reconciliation, though this process faces challenges due to budget constraints and differing priorities among lawmakers. The article notes the narrow Republican majority in the House could make the process difficult, with some lawmakers wanting a more fiscally responsible package.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he plans to give away nearly his entire fortune within the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation, aiming to address urgent global problems such as child mortality, disease, and poverty. This announcement coincides with Gates' criticism of Elon Musk for orchestrating harsh cuts to USAID under the Trump administration, which Gates predicts will increase childhood deaths in poor countries. Gates emphasized his determination to spend 99% of his current fortune on humanitarian causes worldwide. The Gates Foundation, established 25 years ago, has already donated over $100 billion and plans to double its giving by 2045 before dissolving.</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures, including his meme coin $TRUMP, is creating conflicts of interest that are hindering the passage of crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, intended to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns that Trump's personal crypto activities could lead to corruption and erode public trust. Some Democrats view Trump's crypto endeavors as a "pay-for-play scheme," as influence with the president can be cultivated by purchasing cryptocurrency he owns. The article suggests that Trump's pursuit of personal profits is creating a major impediment to long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is under pressure to navigate a volatile economic landscape complicated by President Trump's tariffs, which threaten both growth and inflation. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation and is doing the right thing by remaining cautious, as any action could be perceived as a mistake. Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, but recent economic data does not clearly indicate price spikes or a slowdown. Surveys, however, show heightened worries in the manufacturing and service sectors, and most S&P 500 companies have mentioned tariff concerns on their earnings calls.</p>

          <p>India has accused Pakistan of violating the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, citing ongoing violations and vowing an "adequate and appropriate response." Tensions have been high since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, which India blames on Pakistani-backed militants. Despite President Trump's announcement of a full ceasefire, reports of explosions in Srinagar and troop movements suggest the agreement is fragile. India maintains that Pakistani actions have constituted provocations, while Pakistan denies involvement in the April attack and claims to be conducting retaliatory strikes.</p>

          <p>Germany's new coalition government, formed by the CDU/CSU and SPD, faces significant challenges, including a struggling economy and the rise of the far-right AfD. The government aims to strengthen the economy, limit illegal immigration, and address issues that have contributed to the AfD's growth. The new government will increase border controls and refusals for asylum-seekers, while also launching a major modernization effort with a special investment fund. The new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, seeks to redefine Germany's role in Europe and address foreign policy challenges.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed. Rising global temperatures and extreme weather events are disrupting coastal stopover locations, altering food sources, and increasing mortality rates. Some species are shortening migration routes or abandoning them altogether, leading to conflicts with resident species. The slender-billed curlew was declared extinct due to its inability to adapt to habitat loss.</p>
