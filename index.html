          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing significantly, with its structure now weathertight ahead of a scheduled mid-2026 opening for its first phase. As part of a massive $19 billion overhaul of the entire airport, this new terminal will be JFK's largest and will be dedicated solely to international travelers, featuring a design intended to be flooded with natural light. The project also includes a resilient independent microgrid for power, unique cash-and-carry duty-free shopping, and improved roadway access to the airport. Its opening is strategically timed to coincide with the 2026 World Cup, which will hold games in the nearby New Jersey area.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest following his conviction for witness tampering and bribery, a landmark case for the nation. The court found that Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, conspired to influence imprisoned former paramilitary members to change their testimony regarding his alleged links to paramilitary groups in the 1990s. Uribe, a polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country, has denied all wrongdoing and stated his intention to appeal the verdict. In addition to the house arrest, the 73-year-old was banned from holding public office for eight years and issued a substantial fine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxed cereal sales in the U.S. have been declining for over two decades, with a significant drop of over 13% since 2021, as younger consumers like Gen Z redefine morning meals. This generation is more likely to skip breakfast or opt for alternatives such as eggs, fruit, and protein shakes, driven by a desire for less processed, more nutritious options and concerns over sugar content and artificial dyes. In response to these shifting preferences and health trends, major cereal companies are reformulating products to remove artificial colors and exploring new flavor combinations. The trend reflects a broader generational shift in food relationships, with an emphasis on natural ingredients and recognizable components in their meals.</p>

          <p>A recently declassified annex from special counsel John Durham's report has further undermined claims, championed by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, of a high-level conspiracy to sabotage Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The document confirms that emails central to the “Clinton Plan intelligence,” which suggested a plot to link Trump with Russia, were likely fabricated by Russian intelligence from hacked materials. This finding contradicts the narrative of a “deep state” operation manufacturing intelligence against Trump. The revelation reinforces the conclusions of both the Mueller report and a bipartisan Senate committee report, which affirmed that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to aid Trump's candidacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Ally Bank survey reveals that nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers feel their social spending is hindering their ability to achieve their financial goals. On average, these generations spend around $250 per month on social activities, with 42% admitting to overspending their social budget several times a year. Experts suggest that while socializing is crucial for well-being, many young adults do not adequately budget for these expenses, leading to financial strain and credit card debt. Financial wellness advisors recommend creating a dedicated social budget, exploring free or low-cost activities, and addressing the underlying emotional drivers of overspending to better align financial habits with long-term goals.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a 4% year-over-year decline in its second-quarter operating earnings, falling to $11.16 billion, impacted by a dip in insurance underwriting. In its earnings report, the conglomerate explicitly warned about the considerable uncertainty and potential adverse consequences of U.S. tariff policies on its diverse operating businesses and equity investments. The company's cash reserves remained substantial at $344.1 billion, and it continued to be a net seller of stocks for the eleventh consecutive quarter while not repurchasing any of its own stock in the first half of 2025. Berkshire also reported a $3.8 billion loss from its stake in Kraft Heinz. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian officials have confirmed that the country's oil refineries will continue to import oil from Russia, dismissing earlier reports that they would halt purchases due to the threat of U.S. sanctions. This decision comes as President Trump announced a 25% tariff on all Indian goods and set an August 8 deadline for Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Indian sources stated that purchasing decisions are based on economic factors and that their imports of discounted Russian crude comply with international norms, including the G7 price-cap mechanism. As a major energy importer, India maintains that securing affordable supplies is essential for its population and that its long-standing partnership with Russia remains firm.</p>

After multiple unsuccessful treatments, Meade found a specialized physical therapist and a multi-pronged approach involving physical therapy, relaxation exercises, medication, and ketamine infusions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on President Trump's sweeping asylum crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border, ruling that his administration cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being deported to places where they would face persecution or torture. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower court's finding that a presidential proclamation closing the asylum system defies U.S. law. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying discretionary asylum, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal" and relief under the Convention Against Torture, must still be granted to those who qualify, thereby preserving crucial safeguards for vulnerable migrants already on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The ruling supports the finding that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration appeared to be unconstitutionally based on factors like a person's race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. This decision stems from a lawsuit over high-profile raids in June that targeted locations like car washes and tow yards, causing widespread fear in the region's Latino community. The court's order reinforces that basing arrests on such broad profiles violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

While her lawyers portray her as cooperative, her efforts also include a petition to the Supreme Court and a potential play for presidential clemency from Donald Trump, whose administration is navigating its own political fallout from the Epstein scandal. Experts suggest that Maxwell has little to lose by exploring all avenues, but they remain skeptical that her discussions reflect a genuine desire to reveal the truth. Instead, her actions are seen as a calculated attempt to leverage any opportunity for freedom, regardless of the low probability of success.</p>

The author suggests that instead of getting lost in conspiracy, the message should be simple and repetitive: Trump's actions to shield his friends and allies in the Epstein scandal are part of a broader pattern of behavior. This narrative could resonate with voters who already feel the system is rigged for the rich and powerful. By linking the scandal to kitchen-table issues like tax cuts for the wealthy and threats to union jobs, Democrats could create a powerful and enduring critique of the former president.</p>

          <h2>Indigenous Leaders Condemn Trump's Plan to Reopen Alcatraz Prison as Historical Erasure</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to reopen the former Alcatraz prison has been met with strong condemnation from Indigenous leaders, who view it as an attempt to erase the island's significant history as a site of Native American resistance. From 1969 to 1971, the island was occupied by Indigenous activists in a pivotal protest that spurred major shifts in federal policy toward Native sovereignty and self-determination. For Native communities, especially in the Bay Area, Alcatraz is a powerful symbol of resilience and a beacon of the modern Indigenous rights movement. Leaders argue that using the site for immigrant detention is not only logistically absurd but also deeply retraumatizing, echoing a painful history of displacement and violence against their people.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old Long Beach man, Mark Lorenzo Villanueva, has been arrested on federal charges for allegedly sending money to and expressing a desire to fight for the Islamic State (ISIS). Prosecutors state that Villanueva communicated with self-identified ISIS fighters online, pledged allegiance to the terrorist group, and sent a total of $1,615 to them through intermediaries. The charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. During his arrest, the FBI also recovered what appeared to be a bomb from his bedroom, adding to the severity of the allegations against the lawful permanent resident from the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Following pro football hall of famer Deion Sanders' recent surgery for bladder cancer, medical experts are explaining the complex procedure he underwent, known as neobladder reconstruction. The surgery involves removing the patient's cancerous bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of their own small intestine. This new, sphere-like organ is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because the neobladder is made from the patient's own tissue, there is no risk of rejection, but it lacks the nerves to signal the brain when full, requiring patients to learn a new bathroom schedule. Sanders has been praised for openly discussing the challenge of incontinence, helping to reduce the stigma associated with the condition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement that he ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia in response to social media posts by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Moscow has remained officially silent. Russian news outlets and military commentators have largely dismissed the move as a "temper tantrum" or "meaningless blather," suggesting it is not being treated as a serious military escalation. This lack of an official reaction from the Kremlin, foreign ministry, or defense ministry indicates that Moscow may not feel a response is necessary. The analysis in this article suggests Trump's action could be a strategic part of his unpredictable political style rather than a direct path to a nuclear standoff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an in-depth interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor argues that humanity is facing an existential crisis rooted in a flawed, anthropocentric worldview that separates human consciousness from nature. He contends that the modern concept of the self, originating with Descartes' "I think, therefore I am," has led to the exploitation of the planet and the rise of interconnected crises like climate change and algorithmic authoritarianism. Taylor proposes a new understanding of life based on relationality, where individuals are seen as nodes in a vast, interconnected web. He suggests that recognizing our co-dependence with all life and technology is essential for survival, urging a shift from a mindset of mastery to one of interconnectedness and love for the world.</p>

          <p>A detailed account of the May 7 air battle between Pakistan and India suggests that Pakistan's downing of an Indian Rafale fighter was aided by superior intelligence and Chinese military technology. According to officials, Indian pilots were operating with faulty intelligence about the range of the Chinese-made PL-15 missile, believing they were safely out of reach when they were not. Pakistan successfully employed a "kill chain" that integrated its Chinese J-10C jets with other air and land sensors, giving them better situational awareness. This engagement, one of the largest air battles in decades, has raised questions about the effectiveness of Western hardware against advanced, battle-tested Chinese systems.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments from a Philadelphia 76ers executive and others who have questioned the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship. The author argues that winning the title inside the COVID-19 "bubble" was not easier, but required immense courage, mental fortitude, and resilience from players who were isolated from their families during a global pandemic. The piece emphasizes that the unique and challenging circumstances, including daily testing and the loss of home-court advantage, should be honored rather than discounted. The author concludes that viewing the championship with an asterisk is a product of jealousy and disrespect for what the team accomplished during one of modern history's most difficult periods.</p>

          <p>Several elderly residents who lost their homes or were displaced by the devastating fire in Pacific Palisades are now adapting to a new life at the Avocet retirement community in Playa Vista. For couples like Joe and Arline Halper, who had planned to live in their Palisades home indefinitely, the transition to communal living has been a significant adjustment, but one with unexpected benefits. They have found a warm, friendly, and social environment that combats isolation, along with amenities like fitness centers and on-site care. While some still grapple with the loss of their former independence, they are making the best of their unscheduled reinvention and finding a supportive community in which to restart.</p>

Many are already experiencing a slowdown in sales amid economic uncertainty and fear the tariffs will further depress business, threatening the survival of smaller, family-run establishments. The tariff adds to the pressure on these businesses, which serve as important cultural and economic hubs for the local Indian American community. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent survey found 43% of Ukrainians living overseas wish to go back, though the primary obstacle remains the ongoing war and lack of security. Organizations are working to support the more than one million who have already returned and are preparing for a future influx, addressing challenges like housing, employment, and mental health services for returnees. For many, like Iryna Schestova who returned to Kyiv, the difficulty of integrating into a new society and the deep connection to their homeland outweigh the risks of living in a country at war.</p>
