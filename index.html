          <p>Newly released court documents detail allegations that Erin Patterson, convicted of murdering three relatives with poisoned mushrooms, had previously made multiple attempts to kill her estranged husband, Simon Patterson. The suppressed evidence, now public, includes his testimony about several instances of severe illness after consuming food she prepared, one of which left him in a coma. These charges were dropped before her trial, but the details suggest a long-term pattern of alleged malicious behavior leading up to the fatal lunch. The information provides a disturbing context to the case that jurors were not permitted to hear.</p>

          <p>A discussion featuring cultural critics and producers explores the significant cognitive impact of smartphones, noting that their mere presence can diminish attention spans. The conversation highlights a growing trend among young adults, who feel overly attached to their devices, leading to a renewed interest in simpler "dumbphones" like the BlackBerry. Rather than relying solely on willpower, experts suggest managing phone relationships by creating intentional time away from screens and engaging in more meaningful real-world connections. This approach emphasizes structuring one's environment to reduce the constant pull of digital devices.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying a group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," people aged 80 or older who possess the memory capabilities of those decades younger. A recent study from Northwestern University's SuperAging Program summarizes over two decades of findings on what makes their brains more resilient to the typical shrinkage and cognitive slowdown associated with aging. These insights could provide valuable clues in the fight against dementia and Alzheimer's disease, offering hope for healthier cognitive aging. The research aims to understand the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to this remarkable mental longevity.</p>

          <p>After a period of dormancy, the market for space-related Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed signs of life, with several companies like Karman Holdings and Firefly Aerospace making successful debuts. This trend marks a shift from the previous reliance on SPAC mergers for space firms to go public. Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, the sector's alignment with national priorities and innovation makes it attractive to investors. However, they also caution that increased competition in the private launch market could create downward pressure on costs and profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is considering revoking Kenya's status as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a move prompted by Kenya's deepening relationship with China. The tension follows President William Ruto's state visit to Beijing, where he praised China's role in a "new world order" and secured significant trade and infrastructure deals. This special status, granted in 2024, provides Kenya with military and economic benefits intended to counter Chinese influence in the region. Washington's threat represents a high-stakes geopolitical maneuver, using the designation as leverage to curb Nairobi's alignment with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a large trade deficit that is significantly inflated by the country's massive gold refining industry. While billions of dollars in gold pass through Switzerland, Swiss officials and economists argue that the actual value added is minimal, making the trade data misleading. The tariffs will heavily impact other key Swiss exports like watches, pharmaceuticals, and chocolate, which will now be less competitive in the US market. The Swiss government is currently focused on relief measures rather than retaliation, as negotiations for a lower rate have so far failed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a record high following the release of a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly exceeded expectations. The Japanese investment giant reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from a loss in the same period last year, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. The strong performance was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, its largest since 2021. The gains were attributed to positive results from both private investments and listed portfolio companies like Grab Holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly rebuked the Philippines after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that his country could not avoid being involved in a potential US-China conflict over Taiwan. Marcos cited the Philippines' geographical proximity and the large number of Filipino nationals in Taiwan as reasons for the inevitable entanglement. Beijing responded by accusing Manila of interfering in its internal affairs and undermining regional stability, urging the Philippines to adhere to the one-China principle. The exchange comes amid already heightened tensions between the two nations over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.</p>

The policy sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their parents are not citizens or are in the country on a temporary basis. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs were "extremely likely" to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has quantified the anecdotal sense that California's fire season is starting earlier, finding that it begins an average of six weeks sooner than it did in the early 1990s. Researchers link this shift directly to human-caused climate change, which leads to earlier snowmelt and drier conditions for flammable vegetation. The effect is most pronounced in Northern California, where some regions now face a near year-round wildfire threat. The study ruled out human-ignited fires as the primary driver, confirming that changing climate and meteorological conditions are the main culprits behind the extended season.</p>
