          <p>OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Go, a new subscription plan in India priced at 399 rupees (about $4.60) per month, making it the company's most affordable paid tier yet. This strategic move aims to expand its user base in India, which is already its second-largest market. The Go plan offers significantly higher usage limits for messages, image generation, and file uploads compared to the free version. The company plans to use feedback from the Indian market before considering a wider global rollout for this new, lower-cost offering.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is tracking northward in the Atlantic and is not expected to make direct landfall in the United States. However, the powerful Category 3 storm is projected to generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along the entire East Coast for several days. Officials have issued warnings and evacuation orders for North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding and strong winds. The National Hurricane Center advises that the storm will remain a major hurricane through the middle of the week.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled images of a prototype crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, a design that combines the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane. The photos show a white prototype hovering in helicopter mode, suggesting it is a manned vehicle, which would be a first for the country. This type of aircraft, similar in concept to the US V-22 Osprey, is known for its versatility but also for its significant mechanical complexity and high operational costs. The development marks a significant step in China's military aviation technology.</p>

          <p>A scholar in Gaza provides a harrowing first-person account of the struggle to continue academic work while facing a severe famine deliberately imposed by Israel's blockade. The writer details the physical and cognitive toll of starvation, where simple tasks like reading a paragraph become monumental challenges due to weakness and hunger. The account highlights the collapse of Gaza's economy, the scarcity of cash, and the daily fight for survival, which erodes both physical health and intellectual identity. Despite these conditions, the academic community persists as an act of resistance against erasure, calling for genuine international solidarity.</p>

Chung, a student leader, received refugee status in the UK, while Hui, a former lawmaker, was granted a protection visa in Australia. Both fled Hong Kong after facing charges under the national security law, which critics argue is used to suppress dissent. Hong Kong's Chief Secretary accused the UK and Australia of "harbouring offenders," insisting the arrests were based on evidence, not political stance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a plan to take an equity stake of around 10% in chipmaker Intel, which would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder.

This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and bolster a key national company that has fallen behind global competitors.

          <p>Climate change has caused such significant melting of Italy's Ventina glacier that geologists can no longer conduct in-person measurements, a practice maintained for 130 years. The terrain has become too unstable due to rockslides and debris, burying the traditional benchmarks used to track the glacier's retreat. The glacier has already lost 1.7 kilometers in length since 1895, with the melting accelerating dramatically in recent years. Scientists will now rely on drones and remote sensing to monitor the shrinkage, highlighting the profound impact of rising global temperatures on Europe's alpine environments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a portion of a lawsuit filed by civil rights attorneys against the Trump administration over conditions at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The dismissed claim concerned the government's initial failure to specify which immigration court had jurisdiction, an issue the judge deemed moot after a court was designated. However, claims regarding the violation of detainees' First Amendment rights due to a lack of confidential access to lawyers remain active. The judge transferred the ongoing case to a different federal court district.</p>

          <p>Seattle's police chief, Shon Barnes, was reportedly having lunch just yards away from a jewelry store as it was being robbed in broad daylight. Four masked individuals smashed their way into Menashe & Sons Jewelers, threatening staff and stealing an estimated $2 million worth of merchandise in about 90 seconds. A police source claimed the chief was nearby, and a department spokesperson confirmed his presence at a neighboring business but stated he and his plainclothes security detail were unaware of the crime until police responded. No arrests have been made in connection with the brazen heist.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this. During a meeting, he reiterated unsubstantiated claims that the practice is "corrupt" and susceptible to widespread fraud. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, a power that can only be altered by Congress. Legal experts and election officials have pointed out that an executive order to this effect would be unconstitutional and that mail-in voting is a secure practice.</p>

          <p>Investigation documents released by Idaho State Police reveal that Bryan Kohberger exhibited alarming behavior while he was a doctoral student at Washington State University in the months preceding the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. Fellow students and faculty described him as "creepy" and "sexist," with one professor expressing concern that he might stalk or abuse students if he became a professor. The documents detail multiple complaints about his condescending behavior toward women, which led to disciplinary meetings. Kohberger was sentenced to life in prison for the murders.</p>

          <p>Japanese investment giant SoftBank has announced it will purchase a $2 billion stake in US chipmaker Intel, causing the company's shares to rise. The investment is seen as a vote of confidence in Intel's turnaround strategy and its central role in expanding advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. This news comes as the Trump administration is reportedly considering taking its own 10% stake in the company by converting government grants into equity. Both developments signal a concerted effort to strengthen Intel's position and secure the domestic chip supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that Chinese exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. In the last five years alone, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. This shift suggests Chinese firms are actively diversifying their markets in response to tariffs and a domestic economic slowdown. The trend is contributing to a potential new global trade order where South-South commerce, with Chinese multinationals as key players, becomes a more dominant force. (not investment advice)</p>

Bailey, who will resign from his state position, is known for his conservative legal battles, including defending Missouri's abortion restrictions and suing Starbucks over its diversity policies. His appointment marks another instance of the Trump administration placing a political loyalist without prior FBI experience into a top leadership position at the bureau.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian seafarers account for the largest number of abandoned sailors globally, with nearly 900 currently stranded on vessels in 2024, according to the International Transport Workers' Federation. Abandonment occurs when shipowners sever ties with their crew, failing to pay wages or cover repatriation costs, often leaving them stranded in foreign waters for months. The primary cause is attributed to the "flags of convenience" system, where ships are registered in countries with weak regulations, obscuring true ownership and allowing unscrupulous owners to evade responsibilities. The globalized nature of the industry complicates efforts to resolve these crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the growing trend of Hong Kong residents seeking medical care in mainland China, particularly Shenzhen, poses a long-term threat to the city's own healthcare system. While mainland hospitals offer quicker appointments and clearer pricing, this "unofficial outsourcing" could hollow out Hong Kong's medical sector by reducing patient volume and professional talent. The author warns that if this continues, Hong Kong could lose its capacity for medical innovation, clinical trials, and talent development. The article calls for improvements in the local system's accessibility and efficiency to prevent this decline.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's recent diplomatic engagements, including his meeting with Vladimir Putin and subsequent talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have ultimately benefited Russia. The author suggests that European leaders' rush to Washington successfully prevented Trump from immediately endorsing a "land-for-peace" deal that would partition Ukraine. However, the resulting plan for direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, without a ceasefire, is seen as a stalling tactic that allows Russia to continue its military assault while engaging in performative diplomacy, making no substantive progress toward a just peace.</p>

          <p>The high-stakes meeting in Washington between Presidents Trump, Zelenskyy, and several European leaders yielded several key developments regarding the war in Ukraine. A primary outcome was Trump's arrangement for a potential future face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, though Moscow's commitment remains uncertain. Trump also backed away from demanding a ceasefire before negotiations, a stance European leaders pushed back on, and hinted at providing US security guarantees for Ukraine. Throughout the visit, Zelenskyy conducted a successful charm offensive, presenting a more positive atmosphere than his previous tense encounter.</p>
