          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in serious injuries to four people who were onboard, according to officials. The incident occurred during a "sailing maneuver," as stated by the Mexican Navy, and the masts of the ship snapped upon impact with the bridge's underside. Emergency services, including the NYPD Harbor Unit and SCUBA, responded to the scene, though the exact number of people onboard remains unclear. Authorities are reviewing the status of personnel and equipment, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the collision, which occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one fatality and injuries to at least four others, with authorities declaring it an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which occurred in or near a vehicle parked by the American Reproductive Centers clinic, caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering windows across several blocks. The FBI has launched a major investigation, describing it as one of the largest bombing investigations ever in Southern California, and a person of interest has been identified. The clinic reported that its staff were unharmed and sensitive medical areas were secure, while Planned Parenthood clinics in the area closed out of caution. The bombing has occurred as in vitro fertilization has become increasingly politicized in the debate over reproductive rights.</p>

The Alexander family expressed their gratitude to President Trump and the negotiation team. The release has reignited calls to bring home the remaining hostages held in Gaza, with a coalition of former hostages urging both President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to intensify efforts for a comprehensive agreement.</p>

          <p>A first date in Farmersville, Illinois, turned deadly when Leslie Reeves was murdered and Chris Smith was critically injured in a shooting. Reeves' friend requested a welfare check after being unable to reach her on Thanksgiving Day 2021, leading to the discovery of the crime scene. Smith's family suspected Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, who was later arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder. Despite Tarr's claims of innocence and lack of physical evidence, he was found guilty based on circumstantial evidence, including lies to investigators and the discovery of the murder weapon in his yard, and sentenced to 85 years. Chris Smith survived the shooting but suffers from partial paralysis and memory loss, but has found love with Michelle Albrecht.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a tight presidential election that could determine the future of its centrist government and influence the country's stance on abortion and LGBTQ rights. The election pits pro-EU Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, with foreign policy and social issues taking center stage. A victory for Trzaskowski could enable the governing coalition to fulfill its campaign pledges, while a win for Nawrocki could paralyze the government. The outcome is crucial for Europe, as Poland has become an important voice on NATO's eastern flank against Russian aggression, and the election could impact the continent's anti-democratic, populist trend.</p>

In St. Louis, a church was severely damaged, resulting in one death, while Kentucky experienced significant destruction in Laurel County, where a firefighter was among the fatalities. The storms occurred amid staffing shortages at the National Weather Service, raising concerns about the agency's ability to provide timely warnings, and the region is still recovering from similar storms earlier in the year.</p>

The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was caused by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland, a phenomenon known as a haboob. The event disrupted travel, with visibility dropping to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport, and evoked memories of the Dust Bowl era, highlighting the region's exceptionally dry soil conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on increased prices and urged the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. This followed Walmart's warning that prices on various goods could increase due to import taxes.

Walmart stated that it has always worked to keep prices as low as possible, but there's a limit to what they can bear. The threat by the president highlights the challenges faced by major American companies as a result of his tariffs, including deteriorating sales and potential backlash from the administration.</p>

The hackers revealed that Co-op narrowly avoided a more severe attack by intervening shortly after its computer systems were infiltrated. Experts identified the hackers as part of a cyber crime service called DragonForce, which offers malicious software and a darknet website for extortion in exchange for a cut of ransoms. DragonForce has been actively targeting organizations and recently rebranded itself as a cartel, amid a power struggle in the underground cyber crime world.</p>

Journalism's victory came after overcoming adversity, including being bumped during the race, and was achieved on a warm day that dried out the track, which suited the horse better than the conditions at the Kentucky Derby.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that a second Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is overwhelming public support for it, echoing sentiments expressed by SNP leader John Swinney. Gove emphasized the need for politicians to continually demonstrate that the UK union is working and cautioned against complacency. While Gove acknowledged past disagreements with Scottish government ministers, he maintained that relations were generally cordial and productive. Gove, who will now sit in the House of Lords, highlighted the importance of focusing on the economy, health, and transport to maintain public confidence.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of murdering their parents, have gained a new generation of supporters due to shifting public opinion influenced by pop culture, particularly TikTok, Netflix, and advocates like Kim Kardashian. New evidence about alleged sexual abuse and a Netflix drama have reshaped public perception, leading to reduced sentences with the possibility of parole. The changing views reflect a growing understanding of trauma, sexual abuse, and a shift away from the tough-on-crime mentality of the 1990s, potentially influencing the California Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom's decisions regarding their fate.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and those over 12 with medical conditions placing them at high risk from Covid. The decision requires Novavax to conduct studies on heart conditions linked to the vaccine, potentially costing tens of millions of dollars. This move sharply limits access to the vaccine for healthy individuals under 65, raising concerns about potential risks for those without underlying conditions if a more virulent coronavirus strain emerges. Critics also suggest the restrictions reflect skepticism toward vaccines from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that 81% of Japanese citizens feel "more uneasy than hopeful" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term. Concerns stem from potential impacts of tariffs and unpredictable actions. Despite a temporary tariff pause, unease remains.
