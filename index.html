          <p>China retaliated against President Trump's new tariffs, imposing its own tariffs on U.S. goods and escalating the trade war.  This led to the worst week for U.S. stocks since the 2020 Covid crash, with significant declines in major indexes worldwide.  Economists warned of potential economic contractions and recessions, while small business owners expressed concerns about rising prices and potential closures.  The situation highlights the far-reaching consequences of Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Concerns about the economic repercussions of new U.S. tariffs and the potential for a global trade war caused a significant stock market decline.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced substantial drops, with the Nasdaq entering a bear market.  This downturn erased trillions of dollars in market value, representing the largest two-day drop since the start of the pandemic.</p>
