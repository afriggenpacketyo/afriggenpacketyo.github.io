          <h2>Nebraska Receives Approval to Ban Soda Purchases with SNAP Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 21:08:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, marking a significant shift in federal nutrition policy. This decision reverses two decades of rejections from the federal government, which had previously hesitated to cross corporate interests and anti-poverty groups. The Nebraska program, set to begin in January 2026, will affect around 150,000 food stamp recipients and aims to evaluate changes in their spending habits while providing technical assistance to retailers for the transition. This move could pave the way for similar waivers in other states, sparking debate among health advocates, trade groups, and anti-hunger organizations regarding its impact on healthier choices and potential cuts to SNAP.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the development of the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project intended to protect the United States from foreign missile threats, drawing parallels to Israel's Iron Dome. Trump anticipates the system, overseen by Space Force General Michael Guetlein, will be fully operational before the end of his term, costing $175 billion, though the Congressional Budget Office estimates a higher cost. The Golden Dome aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space, using next-generation military technology, but experts cite technical and financial challenges. This initiative echoes former President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, with Trump expressing confidence that advancements in technology will ensure its success.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a criminal investigation into Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, following accusations of lying to Congress about his decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic as governor. This inquiry comes after the Justice Department dismissed charges against current Mayor Eric Adams, placing the administration in a controversial position of targeting Adams's main political rival. The investigation, prompted by a referral from House Republicans, centers on Cuomo's testimony regarding a New York State Health Department report on nursing home deaths. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney overseeing the case, has publicly criticized Cuomo's handling of the pandemic, adding a layer of political complexity to the investigation.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corporation announced that the 2026 Toyota RAV4 will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. This decision reflects the growing popularity and customer demand for hybrid vehicles, aligning with Toyota's long-standing advocacy for hybrid technology. Despite slower adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers are increasingly turning to hybrids to meet fuel economy regulations and enhance performance. Toyota's electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of its domestic sales in 2024, with RAV4 sales increasing by 9.3%, driven by a surge in hybrid and plug-in hybrid models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by ICF predicts that electricity demand in the United States could increase by as much as 78% by 2050, leading to significant challenges for grid reliability and affordability. The report attributes this surge to rising temperatures, the growing use of emerging technologies like cryptocurrency mining and data centers, and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Retail electricity costs are also expected to rise, potentially doubling by 2050. Electric grid operators are already sounding alarms about elevated summer temperatures, with PJM, one of the largest operators, warning of high peak demand this summer.</p>

          <p>Scientists are predicting an eruption of the Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the Oregon coast, possibly later this year. The volcano, situated more than 4,900 feet beneath the Pacific Ocean, is showing signs of an impending eruption for the first time since 2015. While the eruption poses no danger to people on land, it will be marked by a sharp increase in earthquakes around the volcano. The eruption is a result of a hot spot in the Earth's mantle, a process responsible for forming over two-thirds of the Earth's surface.</p>

          <p>A review commissioned by the Department for Education in England urges universities to enhance efforts to prevent student suicides. The report, examining 169 cases of suicide and serious self-harm, recommends universities conduct safety checks of student halls, discourage tributes in areas where deaths occurred, and improve support for struggling students. Families should be more involved in investigation processes. While some students report feeling supported by university staff, the review highlights the need for better access to mental health services, especially for international students. The review follows increasing financial pressures on universities and calls for a legal duty of care to students.</p>

          <p>The number of Japanese students studying abroad has risen 1.5-fold following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a survey by the Japan Student Services Organization. The total number of students studying abroad reached 89,179 in the fiscal year through March 2024. The most popular destinations were the United States, Australia, and South Korea. The number of international students accepted into Japan also reached a record high, attributed to the popularity of Japanese subcultures and the yen's depreciation.</p>

          <p>The FDA has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups, such as seniors and those with underlying conditions, but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., criticized the "one-size-fits-all regulatory framework" used in the past. Vaccine makers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before the FDA approves future applications for shots to all healthy persons between 6 months and 64 years old.</p>

          <p>The UK has escalated its response to the Gaza offensive by suspending trade deal talks with Israel and imposing sanctions on West Bank settlers. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned Israel's military actions as "morally unjustifiable," citing the humanitarian crisis and warnings of starvation. The UK's actions follow a joint statement from the leaders of the UK, Canada, and France, urging Israel to end its military expansion and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the situation "intolerable," emphasizing the need for humanitarian aid to reach Gaza quickly.</p>

          <p>The NFL is considering a proposal to ban the "tush push" play, a controversial short-yardage tactic popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The proposal cites player safety and pace of play as reasons for the ban, although data does not support the safety concerns. The play involves the quarterback being pushed forward by teammates from behind to gain extra yardage. Some argue that the play is a "cheapo play" akin to a scrum in rugby, while others defend it as a legitimate football strategy.</p>

Trump told the House GOP conference that they should not let division over the SALT cap get in the way of the bill, and said they should not touch Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud and abuse.</p>
