          <p>President Trump is facing increasing pressure both domestically and internationally as he considers potential actions regarding Iran's nuclear facilities. He has been in meetings with advisors to discuss attack plans but is hesitant, preferring Iran to negotiate. Hawks within the Republican party are urging aggressive action, while others advocate for restraint, creating a divide among his supporters. Democrats are also voicing concerns about Trump's authority to engage in military conflict without congressional approval, as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu pushes for U.S. involvement, while Iran warns of retaliation against any intervention. The president says he likes to make the final decision one second before it's due, because things change, especially with war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, marking the third extension since his inauguration. Citing national security concerns, the law requires TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sever ties with the app or face being cut off from U.S. app stores. Trump, who vowed to save TikTok during his campaign, signed an executive order on Thursday which has delayed the date for enforcing the law for a third time. TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension and his leadership and support.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, having rapidly intensified, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific Coast as a Category 3 storm, bringing sustained winds of 125 mph and heavy rain. The hurricane hit the western state of Oaxaca, prompting hurricane warnings from Acapulco to Puerto Angel. While it had briefly reached Category 4 status, it was downgraded before making landfall, causing concern for potential flash flooding and mudslides in the region. Erick is expected to weaken as it moves across Oaxaca, but heavy rainfall is still anticipated, posing a threat to communities in southeastern Guerrero and west-coastal Oaxaca.</p>

The case involved conflicting timelines, disputed evidence, and allegations of misconduct by investigators, drawing significant media attention.

          <p>Hungarian police have banned the annual Budapest Pride march, prompting a defiant response from Mayor Gergely Karacsony, who vowed to organize the event as a local gathering. The move is the latest in a series of confrontations between the nationalist government of Viktor Orban and the LGBTQ community, which has faced increasing restrictions on public expression. The government cites child protection laws, restricting the public promotion of homosexuality, as justification for the ban. Karacsony argues that the police lack the authority to prohibit a "Day of Freedom" organized by the city council, as it does not fall under the regulations governing freedom of assembly.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Israel and Iran, questions arise about the UK's potential involvement, particularly if the U.S. commits military forces. The UK, while calling for de-escalation, is unlikely to be a central player, especially given soured relations with Israel and Israel's determination to act militarily. However, the UK has a diplomatic role, working with European allies to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, with the Foreign Secretary meeting his U.S. counterpart and joining talks with Iran in Geneva. The UK also possesses strategic military assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, and naval presence in the Gulf.</p>

The Trump administration blames Los Angeles' sanctuary policies for the increased risk, while critics argue the federal government's actions are creating a totalitarian atmosphere.

          <p>In an era of heightened sensitivity and widespread offense-taking, learning to manage one's reactions to perceived slights can significantly improve quality of life. Understanding the psychological and neurological mechanisms behind taking offense, such as the activation of the limbic system, is the first step toward controlling responses. Strategies to mitigate offense include using humor, activating the prefrontal cortex through practices like meditation, and limiting exposure to controversial media content. Ultimately, the ability to avoid taking offense can be a source of strength and resilience.</p>

The case has prompted additional women to come forward, highlighting the severity and extent of Zou's crimes. Judge Cottage added Zou had a "sexual interest" in "asserting power and control over women", and that the victims had been "pieces in an elaborate game" for the defendant, who had "no understanding of the meaning of consent".</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, holds a unique place in Thai culture as a common offering at spirit houses, which honor spirits' claim to the land. This practice stems from animism mixed with Brahmanism, where appeasing spirits through offerings is believed to bring protection and blessings. The red color of the soda is thought to be symbolic, replacing past offerings of blood, while its sweetness caters to spirits' preferences. The choice of Fanta is likely due to the brand's long-standing presence in Thailand, making it a readily available and culturally relevant offering.</p>

These workers are spread across the U.S., including in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada. Industry leaders have warned that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations and increase food prices, while research suggests that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers.

          <p>President Donald Trump ripped into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "destructive," after the central bank kept interest rates steady on Wednesday. Trump said "Too Late" Powell is costing the United States "hundreds of billions of dollars" by not cutting rates, leveling a familiar criticism against the Fed chair who has repeatedly ignored Trump's pressure campaign to cut rates. Trump also criticized Powell late Wednesday, calling him a "real dummy" in a near-midnight Truth Social post. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world would need to plant a forest the size of North America in order to offset planet-warming emissions from the 200 largest oil and gas companies, new research has found. A study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment analyzed the economic and ecological benefits of planting trees as a means of balancing potential carbon dioxide emissions from the projected burning of oil reserves held by the fossil fuel industry. The researchers said their findings should not suggest afforestation and carbon offsetting are futile. The main message from the paper, he added, is that ‚Äúoil and gas should remain in the ground.‚Äù</p>
