          <p>Authorities reported that a young girl was bitten by a mountain lion in Malibu on Sunday evening, an incident that prompted her family to immediately transport her to a local hospital for medical attention. While her specific condition was not immediately known, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department swiftly responded to the scene on the 32500 block of Pacific Coast Highway. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has since assumed control of the ongoing investigation, diligently working to ascertain the precise circumstances of the attack and track the animal involved. This unfortunate event serves as a stark reminder of the persistent wildlife presence in Southern California's residential areas and underscores the critical importance of public awareness and safety measures in such environments.</p>

This move, which will benefit the company's 1,900 workers with profit shares and a say in operations, reflects Grant's desire to preserve the family's legacy and Christian ethos, which includes not opening on Sundays and donating 10% of profits to charity. The transfer, set to complete next month, ensures the business's values continue, with financial rewards for the Grant family drawn from future profits. This unique succession plan aims for long-term stability and employee empowerment, fostering a shared sense of ownership.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing a radical shake-up of driving laws, including compulsory eye tests every three years for motorists over 70 when renewing their licenses, to enhance road safety. This initiative, part of a new road safety strategy, follows a coroner's report highlighting the UK's "laxest" licensing system in Europe after four deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight. Additional proposals include reducing the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers. The aim is to curb road deaths and injuries, which cost the NHS over £2 billion annually, promoting safer roads for everyone.</p>

          <p>The extension of the U.S.-China tariff truce remains uncertain as its deadline approaches, despite Beijing's initial optimism for a 90-day renewal. Tensions persist over various issues, including existing tariffs on fentanyl-related goods and certain Chinese imports, alongside U.S. goods facing significant duties. Experts anticipate a Trump-Xi summit, suggesting a more stable but not necessarily friendlier relationship, with both sides leaning towards economic decoupling. Key points of contention also include China's commitment to U.S. agricultural purchases, transshipment concerns, semiconductor export controls, and potential U.S. tariffs over China's Russian oil imports.

          <p>Beijing's municipal government unexpectedly eased property buying curbs for families with residency or tax contributions outside the Fifth Ring Road, a move that surprised market observers. Analysts view this as a positive step, aligning with the central government's stance on removing restrictions in non-central areas and strengthening market confidence. This proactive measure, coming earlier than expected, suggests that other major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen might follow suit in relaxing their own real estate purchasing regulations. The policy aims to address concerns about the timeliness of economic stimulus in the property sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics, including former Commerce Department advisors, express national security concerns, arguing the move trades protections for revenue.

          <p>The Perseids meteor shower, widely considered one of the best celestial displays, is set to peak this week, specifically early Wednesday for observers in North America. However, a bright, 84% full moon will significantly compromise visibility, reducing the expected hourly meteor count from 50 to a mere 10-20. This lunar interference means only the brighter meteors will be discernible. Experts advise viewers to seek out dark, rural areas and consider watching a week past the peak for potentially better conditions. The Perseids originate from cosmic debris left by comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which disintegrates upon entering Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Flaws in Medical Evidence Presented by Both Prosecution and Defense in Lucy Letby Case</h2>

          <p>This article critically examines the complex Lucy Letby case, highlighting significant flaws in the medical evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense, creating two conflicting narratives of her guilt or innocence. Focusing on the unanimous guilty verdict for Baby O's death, the article dissects disputed claims regarding liver injuries and air embolism, revealing lack of consensus even among defense experts. New theories, such as accidental needle punctures or birth trauma, are also scrutinized, often lacking full evidentiary support or contradicting other expert opinions. The case's referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission suggests a potential re-examination of the evidence.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Labels Nvidia H20 Chips Unsafe, Urges Boycott Amid Backdoor Allegations</h2>

          <p>Chinese state media has labeled Nvidia’s H20 AI chips as unsafe, urging Chinese buyers to boycott them due to alleged "back-door" vulnerabilities, despite Nvidia's denials. Yuyuan Tantian, associated with China Central Television, claimed the U.S. government's efforts to embed surveillance features make the chips untrustworthy. This distrust stems from historical attempts to implement chip backdoors and a recent U.S. bill requiring tracking features. Nvidia's chief security officer has publicly refuted these claims, asserting their products contain no backdoors, kill switches, or spyware, but the allegations fuel growing Chinese skepticism towards foreign technology.

          <p>A pioneering summer camp in Ukraine's Carpathian mountains offers solace and group therapy to 50 children whose parents have disappeared during the ongoing war, many presumed dead or in captivity. The charity Gen.Ukrainian runs the camp, providing a safe space for children living in "a frozen state" of trauma, unable to grieve or plan for the future. Activities like campfire sessions and art therapy encourage emotional expression, while psychologists help them cope with the profound uncertainty and secondary traumas, including exposure to violent war content online. The camp also offers respite from constant bombardments and a chance for normal play.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy suffered a significant 4-0 defeat against the Seattle Sounders in their MLS return, a stark contrast to their successful initial phase in the Leagues Cup. Despite this setback, the Galaxy remains one of four U.S. teams qualified for the Leagues Cup quarterfinals, where they will face Pachuca on August 20. The match, which also celebrated the 2005 championship team, saw the Sounders score through an own goal and two from Danny Musovski, with Snydell Brunell sealing the commanding win.

          <p>Elon Musk's Tesla has formally applied to the British energy regulator Ofgem for a license to supply electricity to households and businesses across England, Scotland, and Wales. If approved, this strategic move could enable Tesla to directly compete in the UK energy market as early as next year, leveraging its existing solar energy generation and battery storage businesses. The company already operates a power supplier in Texas, Tesla Electric, which allows EV owners to optimize energy consumption and sell surplus back to the grid. This expansion comes amidst recent declines in Tesla's EV sales across Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents, including personnel from the FBI and DEA, deployed across Washington D.C. following President Donald Trump's public vow to crack down on crime and homelessness. Trump stated he would provide homeless individuals "places to stay, but FAR from the Capital." This action, described as less sweeping than Trump's social media posts suggested, comes despite official data indicating a decline in D.C. crime rates. Local residents and homeless individuals expressed both confusion and worry about the federal presence and potential displacement. Trump also indicated he might consider a federal takeover of policing in the city.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has faced relentless criticism and mockery after a difficult first 100 days, marked by a symbolic initial rejection in the Bundestag and a perception of leading a government nobody wanted. His attempt to forge a modern, culturally conservative mainstream is attacked from both left and right, accused of conceding too much or being too punitive. The political culture is increasingly polarized, with the far-right AfD aiming to destabilize his coalition and gain power. Despite the challenges, Merz and his SPD deputy remain committed to delivering on infrastructure, security, and migration policies, hoping to demonstrate competence.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that China "misinterpreted" his comments suggesting the Philippines would be inevitably drawn into a conflict between China and Taiwan. China had accused Marcos of "playing with fire" after he highlighted the need to evacuate over a hundred thousand Filipinos from Taiwan if conflict erupted, emphasizing his desire to avoid war. This diplomatic clarification comes amid heightened tensions between Manila and Beijing over South China Sea territorial disputes, exemplified by a recent incident where a Chinese coast guard ship used a water cannon on a Philippine vessel near Scarborough Shoal.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its "deport now, appeal later" scheme to 15 additional countries, including Canada, India, and Australia, bringing the total to 23. This policy allows foreign nationals who commit crimes in the UK to be deported before their appeals against removal are heard, with hearings conducted via video link from their home countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion aims to prevent foreign criminals from "exploiting our immigration system" and fast-track removals. This move follows new proposals to deport foreign criminals immediately after receiving custodial sentences, aiming to save taxpayer money and enhance public safety.</p>
