          <p>Thousands of supporters of Hefazat-e-Islam, an influential Islamist group, gathered in Dhaka to protest the interim government's plan to grant equal rights to women, claiming it violates religious laws. The protestors, numbering around 20,000, opposed proposals including equal inheritance rights, a ban on polygamy, and recognition of sex workers as laborers. Hefazat-e-Islam leader Mamunul Haque argued that these recommendations hurt the sentiments of the majority by challenging religious laws of inheritance. The group threatened nationwide rallies if their demands are not met, reflecting the rising visibility of Islamist parties since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal includes eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), echoing his previous unsuccessful attempts during his first term. The proposal, framed as an effort to reduce the size of the federal government, has drawn strong opposition from Democrats. These agencies, along with the Institute of Museum and Library Services, are slated for elimination, despite bipartisan support in Congress that kept them alive and even saw their budgets grow during Trump's first administration.

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett criticized President Trump's trade policy, stating that "trade should not be a weapon" and cautioning against punitive tariffs. Buffett argued that global prosperity benefits the U.S., emphasizing the importance of international trade and cooperation. He noted that protectionist policies could have negative long-term consequences, particularly given the U.S.'s prominent role in the world economy. Berkshire's first-quarter earnings report cited tariffs and geopolitical events as creating "considerable uncertainty" for the conglomerate, as Berkshire has been selling stocks for 10 straight quarters, accumulating a record $347 billion in cash.

          <p>President Trump claimed that grocery and gas prices are falling, but economists say this is misleading, as since Trump took office, food price hikes have accelerated and gas prices have remained relatively flat. While overall inflation has eased slightly, even a low level of inflation indicates an increase in price levels, according to economists. Egg prices, in particular, have soared, while gas prices remain similar to when Trump took office, despite a drop in oil prices.

          <p>On World Press Freedom Day, an advocate is calling for the release of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong publisher imprisoned for publishing views critical of the Chinese Communist Party. Lai, who fled Communist China as a child, founded Apple Daily, a newspaper known for its pro-democracy stance and criticism of the CCP. Despite facing retaliation and arrests, Lai refused to flee Hong Kong and continues to stand for his beliefs, even as he faces a potential life sentence. The article underscores Lai's commitment to freedom of speech and his role as a symbol of hope for many.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to the National Climate Assessment, two major US scientific societies, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), have announced they will collaborate to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis's impact. The effort aims to sustain the momentum of the sixth National Climate Assessment, whose authors and staff were dismissed by the Trump administration. The collaboration will not replace the NCA but will instead create a mechanism for important work on climate change's impact to continue. The article highlights the scientific community's response to the administration's actions and the ongoing commitment to climate research.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 10:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to El Salvador and paying for their imprisonment is facing scrutiny, with constitutional challenges focusing on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. While El Salvador's prison system is notoriously harsh, the Supreme Court has historically been reluctant to recognize cruel treatment as punishment unless imposed after a criminal conviction. This creates a perverse incentive for the government to imprison individuals without due process, potentially circumventing Eighth Amendment protections. The article argues that the Supreme Court should clarify that the government cannot subvert the Bill of Rights by skipping trials and sentences.</p>

          <p>As China and the United States remain entangled in a trade war, China is considering offering deeper cooperation on fighting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. as a way to de-escalate tensions.

          <p>Warren Buffett criticized President Trump's use of tariffs, stating that "trade should not be a weapon" during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.

          <p>Tim Friede, a self-taught snake expert, has been injecting himself with snake venom for nearly 18 years, effectively gaining immunity to several neurotoxins. Immunologist Jacob Glanville collaborated with Friede to study his blood, leading to the development of an antivenom that can protect against bites from 19 species of venomous snake in mice. The antivenom consists of two antibodies isolated from Friede's blood and a venom-blocking drug, potentially offering a more effective and safer treatment than traditional methods. The research highlights the potential for human-derived antibodies to revolutionize snakebite treatment and save lives.</p>

          <p>Peter Dutton's defeat in the Australian election has been attributed to a combination of factors, including an inconsistent campaign and a perceived "Trump effect." Dutton's hard-line conservatism, immigration policies, and criticism of China drew comparisons to Donald Trump, which alienated voters. The Coalition pursued policies similar to the Trump administration, such as cutting public sector jobs, further reinforcing this image. Dutton's campaign also suffered from gaffes and missteps, contributing to his loss and Albanese's victory.
