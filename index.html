          <p>On Wednesday, Poland reported that Russian drones violated its airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine. Polish and allied forces shot down several drones, marking the first time NATO aircraft engaged potential threats in allied airspace.  This incident prompted Poland to formally request urgent NATO talks under Article 4 of the alliance's treaty, citing a threat to its security.  Ukrainian President Zelenskyy stated that the drone incursion was intentional, not accidental, and warned of further Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>A judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, pending a lawsuit challenging her removal.  The judge ruled that Trump's stated reason—allegations of mortgage fraud that predated Cook's appointment—did not constitute legal cause for removal under the Federal Reserve Act.  The decision ensures Cook's participation in upcoming Fed meetings, where interest rate cuts are expected.  The Trump administration vowed to continue its efforts to remove Cook.</p>
