          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Expectations in February</h2>

          <p>UK government borrowing in February was £10.7bn, significantly higher than the predicted £6.5bn.

Economists warn that the higher-than-expected borrowing increases the risk of Reeves missing her self-imposed borrowing rules. <i>(not investment advice)</i><br></p>
