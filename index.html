          <p>Authorities in Salt Lake City, Utah, have arrested two men suspected of placing an incendiary device under a news media vehicle. The bomb, discovered near an occupied building, had been lit but failed to function as designed. Investigators, with FBI assistance, served a search warrant at a Magna home, leading to the arrest of a 58-year-old and a 31-year-old. The suspects could face charges related to weapons possession and terrorism threats, as explosives, firearms, and hoax weapons were found during the search. A motive remains undisclosed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that foreign workers are "welcome" in the U.S. and that he aims not to deter investment, a declaration made days after the arrest of hundreds of South Korean nationals at a Georgia work site. The arrests, part of a broader immigration crackdown, targeted individuals allegedly overstaying visas or holding improper work permits. Trump emphasized the temporary necessity of foreign experts for teaching complex product manufacturing. This incident caused widespread alarm in South Korea, leading to the repatriation of the workers.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has identified Charles Mwesigwa as the alleged leader of a sexual assault ring operating in Dubai's affluent neighborhoods, exploiting vulnerable Ugandan women. Women, some believing they were traveling for legitimate jobs, were allegedly trapped in debt and forced into degrading acts, including "porta potty" requests. The article also reveals two women linked to Mwesigwa died after falling from high-rise apartments, with families questioning police investigations. Mwesigwa denies the allegations, claiming he only connects women with landlords and wealthy contacts, but evidence suggests a deeply disturbing operation.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a popular two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer.

He later became critical of the Republican party's shift to the right and supported Kamala Harris in the last election.

          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's struggles stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 formation. While acknowledging tactical improvements in team compactness, Murphy highlights individual mistakes, such as Bruno Fernandes's defensive lapses when played deeper, as costing the team goals. The article suggests that manager Ruben Amorim is exacerbating issues by deploying players in roles where their natural instincts or qualities are not optimized, leading to recurring errors despite overall system improvements. Murphy advocates for a shift in personnel to address these fundamental issues.</p>
