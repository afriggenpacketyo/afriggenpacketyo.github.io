          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year, citing potential links to health conditions like ADHD and cancer. The FDA will work with food companies to remove dyes from products and is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings. The plan is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies to transition to natural alternatives. The International Association of Color Manufacturers questioned the proposed timeline, while the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would work with the administration.</p>

          <p>Recent newspaper headlines focus on topics such as a proposed peace plan between Russia and Ukraine, the economic impact of Donald Trump's tariffs, and the death of Pope Francis. The proposed peace deal would reportedly allow Putin to retain most of the territory seized from Ukraine, while Trump's tariffs are criticized by the IMF for negatively impacting the world economy. The UK is hosting US and European negotiators to discuss the Ukraine peace talks, while the Pope's death continues to be a major news story. The Daily Mail leads with Kemi Badenoch's statement that Sir Keir Starmer "owes apology to so many women" after the Supreme Court's biological sex ruling.</p>

CBS News refutes Trump's claims and defends its editing practices. Owens stated he was stepping aside to allow the show to move forward, while CBS News praised his commitment to truth and impactful journalism.

Analysts suggest that Musk's controversial political involvement has damaged Tesla's brand, leading to protests and decreased demand.

          <p>The Supreme Court seems inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their children out of instruction using storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case revolves around whether the school's policy infringes on parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. The conservative majority of the court questioned why opt-outs were not feasible, given that they are allowed for other areas of instruction. The debate centers on balancing religious freedom with the school's goal of fostering mutual respect in a pluralistic community.</p>

The lawmakers expressed support for the students' free speech rights and criticized the Trump administration's actions. They raised concerns about the conditions of the detention facilities and the students' access to medical care. The students' legal teams allege that the choice of a Louisiana jail was deliberate, to keep them away from their homes and ensure a conservative court would decide their case.</p>

The move comes after several states introduced bills to ban artificial food dyes, citing concerns about neurobehavioral effects in children. While the industry expressed concerns about differing state laws, it also welcomed the FDA's approach of phasing out dyes rather than implementing a ban. Critics argue that the move is only a small step towards addressing the larger issues in the American diet, such as excessive sugar consumption.</p>
