        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bidders for a portion of Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at up to US$5 billion, potentially making it one of the largest divestments by a global consumer company in China recently. This valuation, based on approximately 10 times its expected 2025 EBITDA, indicates strong interest despite sluggish growth and intense local competition for Starbucks in the Chinese market. The sale would allow Starbucks to streamline its presence in a challenging but significant international market. At least one bidder offered a higher multiple, suggesting competitive bidding.

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles narrowly defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 in the NFL season opener, a game overshadowed by the ejection of Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter just six seconds in for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. Carter's early exit significantly impacted the Eagles, who committed numerous penalties throughout the game. Despite these self-inflicted mistakes and a lightning delay, the Eagles secured the win, with Jalen Hurts accounting for 214 yards and Saquon Barkley rushing for a touchdown. The Cowboys' late drives were thwarted by dropped passes, allowing the Eagles to ice the game.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains after President Trump formalized a trade deal with Japan, lowering auto import tariffs to 15% and confirming $550 billion in Japanese investments in U.S. projects. The executive order also included Trump's intent to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not relocating production to the United States, causing several Asian chip stocks to rise. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi climbed, reflecting market reactions to these trade and manufacturing policy announcements. U.S. equity futures also showed slight movement ahead of the August jobs report, with overnight gains on hopes for a favorable report. (not investment advice)</p>

During the dinner, Bill Gates discussed advancements in vaccine technology, while Trump praised HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "different take" on vaccines.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by two major political stories: Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's "judgement day" over stamp duty underpayment allegations and Nadine Dorries' defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK. The Daily Telegraph calls for Rayner's resignation, citing contradictions in her account, while other papers describe the row as a "crisis point" for Labour. Dorries' defection is seen as a "seismic blow" to the Conservatives, potentially boosting Nigel Farage and Reform UK ahead of an election. Tributes to fashion designer Giorgio Armani also feature prominently, celebrating his revolutionary impact on style.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has halted a lower court's ruling that required Florida and the Trump administration to dismantle parts of the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention site in the Everglades. This 2-1 decision allows the controversial facility to remain open while an environmental lawsuit proceeds, with the court concluding officials are likely to prove the site is not subject to federal environmental reviews. Environmental groups and a Native American tribe had argued the site, located in a sensitive ecosystem, required such reviews. The Department of Homeland Security lauded the ruling, framing the lawsuit as an attempt by "open-borders activists" to obstruct law enforcement.</p>

          <p>PBS announced it is cutting approximately 15% of its jobs, amounting to over 100 positions including vacant ones, due to federal funding cuts. The Republican-led Congress eliminated $1.1 billion in public broadcasting funds, and the Trump administration ended a major education grant, resulting in a 21% revenue hit for PBS. CEO Paula Kerger stated that all facets of PBS would be affected, forcing "hard choices" similar to those faced by other public media organizations like KQED and GBH, which have also initiated layoffs. NPR's CEO also plans budget reductions to support affected stations, with estimates suggesting 70-80 public radio stations could shut down.</p>

This change was supported by revered military leaders like Truman and Eisenhower, who recognized the broader scope of defense in a dangerous world. The piece suggests that such a symbolic rebrand will not intimidate adversaries like China or Russia, who also use "Ministry of Defense" titles.</p>

          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark will miss the remainder of the Indiana Fever's season due to a right groin injury, which she sustained in July and later developed into a bone bruise. Clark, the 2024 Rookie of the Year, expressed deep disappointment at not being able to return to play, despite extensive rehabilitation efforts. Her absence adds to the Fever's injury woes, with five players now out for the season. While a personal setback, Clark's impact on women's basketball growth remains significant, with the league experiencing record attendance even without her on the court for much of the season.</p>

Sabalenka's win restores her momentum, setting her up to potentially claim her first Grand Slam title of the season and become the first woman since Serena Williams to defend the Flushing Meadows title.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the U.S. is prepared to "blow up" foreign crime groups if necessary, potentially in collaboration with other nations, and announced the designation of two major Ecuadorian gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. These remarks follow a U.S. strike in the Caribbean that reportedly killed 11 suspected drug traffickers, prompting questions about unilateral action against smugglers. Separately, the Pentagon accused two Venezuelan military aircraft of a "highly provocative move" near a U.S. Navy vessel, alleging interference with counter-narcotics operations. The U.S. also pledged security aid and drone technology to Ecuador to combat rising drug trafficking violence, which is a significant driver of migration.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office reported that President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, in response to immigration raid protests, cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. This figure includes substantial expenses for food, pay, and travel for the more than 4,200 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines deployed. A judge recently ruled this military deployment for immigration enforcement violated federal law, with Newsom criticizing the action as "waste, fraud and abuse" and an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism." The governor's office emphasized the financial and societal costs, including the impact on soldiers forced into rushed, poorly accommodated deployments.</p>

This confounding performance drops the Dodgers to a 22-30 record since July 4, jeopardizing their NL West lead and their chances for a first-round playoff bye.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing President Trump's policy restricting transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports reflecting their gender identities. This decision follows Trump's executive order directing the government to only recognize male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that the policy was arbitrary and reflected unconstitutional prejudice. The court noted the "immediate and irreparable harms" faced by affected individuals, solidifying the temporary block on the policy.</p>
