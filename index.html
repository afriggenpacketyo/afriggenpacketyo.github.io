          <p>This upcoming week is critical for the stock market, with investors closely monitoring several key events. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its interest rate decision, while new reports on inflation and employment will provide crucial insights into the economy's health. Additionally, major technology and consumer companies like Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings reports, offering a gauge of corporate performance amidst ongoing trade negotiations and economic uncertainty. The confluence of these events will likely introduce significant volatility for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a general 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by the Trump administration. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy. The deal aims to rebalance the trade relationship and bring stability, although specific details are still emerging.</p>

          <p>Tech company UBTech has unveiled the Walker S2, a humanoid robot designed for factory work that can operate nearly 24/7 by swapping its own batteries without human assistance. When its power runs low, the robot autonomously navigates to a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fresh one, a process that takes about three minutes. This innovation, already being tested in Chinese car factories, represents a significant step toward continuous automation in manufacturing and other sectors. The development highlights a broader push in robotics to create machines capable of sustained, independent work.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has voiced "deep concern" following reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This independent panel of volunteer experts provides evidence-based recommendations on clinical preventive services, such as cancer and depression screenings, which insurers are then required to cover. The reported plan has drawn criticism from numerous health organizations, who argue that dismantling the non-partisan task force would disrupt access to lifesaving care and undermine a critical component of public health. This follows a previous move by Kennedy to remove members of a CDC vaccine advisory panel.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has uncovered that a planned major music festival, Monmouth Rising, was an elaborate fiction created by a convicted fraudster named James Kenny. The festival falsely claimed a lineup including major bands like The Killers and was promoted as a 45,000-capacity, hydrogen-powered event. Kenny managed to deceive industry professionals, employees, and suppliers, using forged documents and false claims of backing from prominent investors and the Welsh government. The scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize, leaving employees and businesses with significant financial losses and exposing the festival as a complete fabrication.</p>

Though he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on teaching, his sharp, witty, and often controversial work left a lasting legacy, influencing generations of comedians and satirical musicians.</p>

The industry now looks to Disney's upcoming decision on "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026, as the next major indicator.

Having fueled distrust in the "deep state," Trump now presides over it and faces pressure from his own base to release all information about Epstein's network. The article argues that any attempt to deflect or manage the information only deepens suspicion, given the public's widespread belief that the government is hiding a client list.

          <h2>Israel Announces Daily 'Tactical Pause' in Fighting in Parts of Gaza to Facilitate Aid</h2>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in specific areas of Gaza to allow for the secure distribution of humanitarian aid. The pause, effective for 10 hours each day, is intended to help the United Nations and other agencies address the severe hunger crisis in the territory. This decision follows months of restricted aid access and mounting international pressure over the risk of famine, underscored by recent images of malnourished children. While aid agencies welcomed the move, they reiterated that a full ceasefire is necessary to adequately reach everyone in need.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team successfully batted for over five sessions to secure a remarkable draw against England in the fourth Test, keeping the series alive. Despite a valiant effort from England on the final day, India's determined resistance, aided by a placid pitch, prevented an English victory. After an early breakthrough, England's hopes were raised, but a crucial dropped catch allowed Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar to build an unbroken partnership, both scoring centuries. The draw means England maintains a 2-1 series lead heading into the final Test at The Oval.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has reportedly agreed to a deal with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz for a fee of €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons. The agreement was reached after Liverpool rejected an earlier, lower bid from the Bundesliga champions.

The 28-year-old has been a key player for Liverpool since joining from Porto in 2022, contributing significantly to their recent successes.</p>

          <p>During a television interview, Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin repeatedly and incorrectly claimed that Jeffrey Epstein's controversial 2008 non-prosecution plea deal was made under the Obama administration. The host, CNN's Jake Tapper, corrected the senator multiple times, pointing out that the deal was negotiated in 2008 when George W. Bush was president and the U.S. Attorney involved was a Bush appointee. Despite the correction, Mullin insisted the case was sealed in 2009 under Obama, conflating the timeline of the agreement with a later court action. The exchange highlighted ongoing political maneuvering surrounding the Epstein case.</p>
