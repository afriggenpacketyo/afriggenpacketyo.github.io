          <p>A federal judge's impending ruling on Google's lucrative default search contracts, valued at over $26 billion annually, could significantly reshape the tech landscape. While Google risks losing search traffic and predictability, analysts suggest this could free up funds and drive its AI development, potentially making it a top-performing stock. The Department of Justice is also pushing for restrictions on AI distribution deals and data-sharing mandates, aiming to foster competition in the evolving search and AI sectors. This article highlights the complex interplay between antitrust regulations and technological innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued an official apology for the country's forced contraception campaign, which saw over 4,500 Inuit women in Greenland fitted with IUDs without consent between the 1960s and 1992. Many victims, often teenagers at the time, suffered sterility and health issues. The apology extends to other instances of systematic discrimination against Greenlanders, coming ahead of a report on the mistreatment and as about 150 women pursue compensation. This acknowledges a dark chapter in Danish-Greenlandic relations and the lasting impact on the Indigenous population.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, extending a restraining order until his latest legal challenge is resolved in early October. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order, then brought back to the U.S. to face charges he denies. His attorneys are now seeking to reopen his immigration case for asylum, arguing that his re-entry makes him eligible to apply within one year. The ruling mandates he remain in custody within a 200-mile radius of the Maryland court, ensuring his presence for the upcoming evidentiary hearing.</p>

The department store narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upward. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged slower sales due to economic pressures on lower- and middle-income customers but highlighted efforts to reintroduce popular sections and overhaul discount strategies. The company aims for long-term growth amidst recent leadership turmoil and declining annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese animated fantasy film "Ne Zha II" has achieved unprecedented global success, earning over $2 billion worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2025, the highest-grossing animated film, and the highest-grossing non-English-language film in history. Despite a modest U.S. re-release, an earlier subtitled version performed well, indicating an American appetite for Chinese storytelling. The article attributes its success to being an epic sequel with eye-popping visuals, blending Chinese aesthetics with global animation influences to create a universally appealing story of coming-of-age.</p>

          <p>California's bolstered film and TV tax credit program has successfully attracted 22 television series, including two that relocated from Texas and Canada, marking a nearly 400% increase in applications. The program, with an annual cap now at $750 million, allocated $255.9 million in credits, expected to generate $1.1 billion in economic activity and employ thousands. Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized the program's role in curbing "runaway production" and reinforcing California's status as the entertainment capital. This initiative broadens eligibility and offers higher tax credits, making the state more competitive.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their gas and electricity prices rise by 2% under the latest energy cap announced by Ofgem, leading to a typical annual bill of £1,755, an increase of £35. This rise, slightly higher than anticipated, takes effect in October and is attributed to increased financial support for benefit recipients and costs associated with balancing energy supply. Campaigners warn of another winter of high energy bills, while Ofgem suggests consumers consider fixed-price deals, which are currently cheaper than the capped variable rate.

The "living" sector (multifamily, senior living) shows the most improvement, while industrial lags due to supply chain uncertainty and tariffs.

          <p>Miriam Toews' new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," delves into her lifelong wrestling with grief and guilt following the suicides of her father and sister, exploring why she writes. The article highlights how Toews channels personal calamities into her fiction, with this memoir offering a candid, non-linear meditation on living with unspeakable loss. Drawing on Christian Wiman's concept of a "truce that is not peace," Toews reflects on how writing, initially a promise to her sister to "live and write," became her own means of survival and a way to maintain connection with her lost loved ones.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, reportedly canceled planned visits to southern Lebanese cities following widespread criticism for telling journalists to "act civilized" rather than "animalistic" during a press conference. The remarks, made after a meeting with Lebanon's President where Hezbollah disarmament was discussed, drew condemnation from Lebanese journalists' unions and social media users, who called them "insulting" and reflective of "colonial superiority." The Lebanese Presidency expressed regret for the statements, and the union called for an official apology and a boycott of Barrack's activities.</p>

This follows the termination of a multi-million dollar grant to California for refusing to comply. The Administration for Children and Families stated federal funds would not "advance dangerous ideological agendas."

          <p>This op-ed by Lawrence Douglas argues that while the US resisted a disorganized coup attempt, it faces a greater threat from "dictatorial creep" through the normalization of exceptional measures. Douglas cites actions like the militarization of domestic policing, federal agent deployment in D.C., and raids on political opponents as signs of a "prerogative state" where executive power is unbound. He warns that such tactics, often with a thin veneer of legality, undermine democratic norms and could escalate, potentially even affecting election processes.
