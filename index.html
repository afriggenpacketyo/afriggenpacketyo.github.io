          <p>Nottingham Forest has fired head coach Nuno Espirito Santo after a 20-month tenure that saw the club achieve its highest Premier League finish in decades and qualify for European competition. The dismissal follows a period of public friction between Nuno and owner Evangelos Marinakis, reportedly stemming from disagreements over the club's transfer policies. Despite on-pitch success, including a current 10th-place standing, the deteriorating relationship with ownership led to the decision to seek a new manager, with an appointment expected shortly.</p>

          <p>A letter allegedly signed by Donald Trump, sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003, has been released by House Democrats on the Oversight Committee. The document, part of a "birthday book" provided by Epstein's estate, contains a hand-drawn sketch and a cryptic message, the existence of which Trump has previously denied, even suing The Wall Street Journal for reporting on it. The White House continues to dispute the letter's authenticity, claiming the signature is not Trump's and vowing to continue litigation, while the committee's investigation into Epstein's records proceeds.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic examines President Donald Trump's escalating use of violent rhetoric, highlighting recent social media posts that threaten military action against the city of Chicago and a proposal to rename the Defense Department the "Department of War." The article contextualizes this language within a pattern of behavior that includes encouraging violence at rallies and promoting harsh treatment of suspects, suggesting a shift from outward-facing military threats to domestic ones. This trend is framed as an "imperial boomerang," where tools of repression used abroad are eventually turned inward against a nation's own population.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court is set to rule on whether former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve prison time he avoided by staying in a hospital after his return from exile. Thaksin spent his entire six-month sentence in a hospital's VIP wing before being paroled, sparking public outrage and skepticism about the severity of his illness. The verdict comes during a period of political turmoil for the Shinawatra family, following his daughter's recent ousting as prime minister, and could result in the influential tycoon being ordered back to prison to complete his sentence.</p>

          <p>A significant policing operation, including the use of drones and a temporary airspace restriction, will be implemented for President Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK. King Charles will host the president at Windsor Castle, prompting Thames Valley police to establish a round-the-clock security presence in the town from September 16-18. This measure, which prohibits non-police drones and small aircraft from the area, is part of a large-scale security plan for the high-profile event, which is also expected to draw protests organized by the Stop Trump Coalition.</p>

This decline in optimism coincides with growing concerns about job security and a recent slowdown in U.S. hiring, with the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.3%.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles to resume large-scale immigration raids. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority ruled that agents can continue making stops, even if factors like a person's race, language, or type of work contribute to the suspicion. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration's immigration policies, while the dissenting liberal justices warned it could subject countless people to indignities and effectively legalize racial profiling, creating a "second-class citizenship status."</p>

          <p>Two Republican senators, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have initiated a new congressional investigation into the response to the deadly Palisades fire in California. The probe will examine the sufficiency of emergency preparations by state and local officials, with a specific focus on why a local reservoir was empty, which may have hampered firefighting efforts. This federal inquiry adds to several ongoing investigations into the fire that devastated the community in January, as lawmakers and residents seek answers and accountability for the perceived failures in the emergency response.</p>

          <p>A virtual summit of the BRICS nations, intended to present a united front against U.S. trade policies, concluded with a more cautious tone than anticipated. Key members, notably India and Brazil, seemed reluctant to directly antagonize the Trump administration, reflecting a delicate balancing act. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend, sending his foreign minister instead, who delivered a subtle critique of U.S. tariffs while also highlighting India's own trade deficits with other BRICS partners. The meeting underscored the difficulty the bloc faces in formulating a unified, defiant stance against escalating U.S. protectionism.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on their enforcement tactics, U.S. immigration officers have immediately ramped up sweeps in the Los Angeles area. A regional Border Patrol chief announced that agents were "going hard" just hours after the ruling, which allows them to consider race and language as factors in stops. This rapid resumption of controversial raids has intensified fear within immigrant communities, as advocacy groups and dissenting justices argue the court's decision effectively permits racial profiling and threatens the constitutional rights of residents, including U.S. citizens who may be wrongfully detained.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Wesley Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, is underway in Florida, drawing attention to the issue of political violence. Routh allegedly hid in bushes at Trump's golf course with a rifle before being apprehended. A key feature of the trial is Routh's decision to represent himself, which the presiding judge, Aileen Cannon, strongly advised against. This case, along with another assassination attempt on Trump in 2024, has led to increased scrutiny of the Secret Service's protective measures for presidential candidates.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park in the San Francisco Bay recently filmed a coyote paddling across the Raccoon Strait, a deep channel separating the island from the mainland. This sighting offers a rare glimpse into how the island's "budding population" of coyotes, first established in 2017, likely arrived. Researchers believe a breeding pair originally swam over a mile through strong currents to reach the island, establishing a new predator niche. The park uses these sightings to educate the public on coexisting with the animals, confirming that coyotes are surprisingly strong swimmers.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the historic cultural monument designation for Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home, effectively blocking the owners' plans to demolish it. This is the second time the property has been saved, following a unanimous L.A. City Council vote last year. The homeowners had sued the city, arguing the house had been too heavily altered over the years to qualify as a landmark. The ruling is a victory for historians and fans who consider the house, the only one Monroe ever owned herself, an irreplaceable piece of Hollywood history.</p>
