          <p>French authorities are investigating a series of Islamophobic acts after at least nine pig heads were discovered outside mosques in Paris and its suburbs. The city's police chief confirmed the discoveries and stated that every effort is being made to apprehend the perpetrators of what officials have called "despicable" and "outrageous" acts. The incidents have been condemned by government ministers and Muslim community leaders, who described them as a sad escalation in anti-Muslim hatred in a country with Europe's largest Muslim population.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Gamze Kubaşık reflects on the murder of her father, Mehmet Kubaşık, who was the eighth victim of the German neo-Nazi group National Socialist Underground (NSU) in 2006. She describes the initial police investigation which wrongly focused on her family, leading to social ostracization and immense personal pain, a common experience for the victims' families. Kubaşık now works in political education, sharing her story to combat the rise of far-right extremism in Germany and ensure the victims of the NSU's racist terror campaign are not forgotten.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has obtained and released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a 2003 "birthday book" that features a page attributed to Donald Trump. While Democrats highlighted the page, the White House has vehemently denied its authenticity, calling the letter "fake" and stating the signature is not Trump's, vowing to continue litigation against media outlets that reported on it. The 238-page book, allegedly compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, also includes entries under a "Friends" category listing figures like Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz, further intensifying scrutiny of Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed emphasizing it poses no threat to downstream nations Egypt and Sudan. The $5 billion dam on the Blue Nile is crucial for Ethiopia's economic goals, aiming to significantly boost its electricity production and supply power to neighboring countries. Despite long-standing concerns from Egypt, which views the dam as an "existential threat" to its water supply, Ahmed framed the project as a monumental achievement for the continent and a tool for regional prosperity.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials report that a Russian airstrike on the village of Yarova in the eastern Donetsk region has killed at least 21 people and wounded many more. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the victims were civilians who had gathered to collect their pension payments from a postal vehicle. The attack, which occurred near the front lines where Russian forces are advancing, represents one of the deadliest single strikes on civilians in recent weeks, prompting Zelensky to condemn the act and call for a global response.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox argues that Donald Trump is brazenly using his second term as president to enrich himself and his family, far beyond the spectacle of donating his official salary. The analysis points to the public offering of his media company and, more significantly, the launch of several cryptocurrencies by the Trump family, including the $WLFI token, which has reportedly added billions to their on-paper net worth. The piece contends that these ventures represent a nakedly corrupt practice of leveraging the presidency to attract investors seeking to curry favor with the administration.

This comes as the company faces pressure to innovate in AI and after CEO Tim Cook's diplomatic efforts to shield Apple from the most severe trade penalties.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that recent rhetoric from President Trump, such as describing certain individuals as "born to be criminals," echoes the dangerous and pseudoscientific ideas of the eugenics movement. The article traces the history of eugenics in the U.S., which promoted the idea that social problems could be solved by controlling heredity, leading to forced sterilization laws upheld in cases like Buck v. Bell. The author suggests that these discredited notions of "fit" and "unfit" people are re-emerging in contemporary political discourse and policy debates, particularly around crime and social welfare.</p>

          <p>In his new book, researcher Elliot Haspel argues that for the U.S. to create a robust, federally funded child-care system, advocates must shift their messaging. He contends that the common economic argument—that child care enables parents to work—is "morally impoverished" and fails to build broad public support. Instead, Haspel proposes framing high-quality, accessible child care as a fundamental American value and a right, similar to public education, that strengthens families, communities, and the nation as a whole, which could be a more compelling case for transformative policy change.</p>

          <p>A historian draws parallels between the Trump administration's current immigration roundups and the violent purges of Chinese immigrants in California during the 1880s. The article highlights the story of Oo Dock, one of the few Chinese residents allowed to remain in Del Norte County after white mobs forcibly removed hundreds of his peers, an event that became known as the "Eureka method." The comparison suggests that the fear and social disruption caused by today's raids echo a dark, often-overlooked chapter of state-sanctioned racism and forced removal in American history.</p>
