While acknowledging concerns over Senate-made changes to Medicaid, Bacon argued that voting against the bill would effectively mean a significant tax increase for his middle-class constituents. His position illustrates the difficult choice facing some Republicans, balancing the bill's tax cuts with controversial spending reductions and its projected impact on the national debt.

The judge granted a class-action certification for all individuals affected by the order but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow for a government appeal.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that hormone therapy combining estrogen and progestin for menopause symptoms may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen-only therapy, typically prescribed for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research provides a more nuanced understanding compared to older, controversial studies, emphasizing that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Health experts advise that women should discuss their individual risks and treatment options thoroughly with their doctors.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, the lead prosecutor detailed the crucial evidence that led to his arrest for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. Key items included Kohberger's DNA found on a knife sheath left at the scene, which was matched using a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash. Investigators also used cell phone data and surveillance footage to track his movements and noted that his car had been "meticulously cleaned" after the crime. While the evidence summary explains how the case was solved, a clear motive remains unknown.</p>

          <p>A recent Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in 2024, a major increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this change is not necessarily an ideological move to conservatism but rather a reflection of populist sentiment and disillusionment with the Democratic party. Analysts point to economic concerns and frustration with immigration policies as key drivers, arguing that both parties have failed to effectively address the priorities of this diverse and evolving voting bloc.</p>

          <p>A group of former federal health officials has issued a stark warning that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could have severe negative health consequences. The proposed 2026 budget would slash the CDC's funding by over 50%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The former officials argue these cuts would cripple state and local health departments, which rely heavily on federal funding, and undermine critical programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention.

          <p>The Pentagon now assesses that U.S. airstrikes last month on three key Iranian facilities have set back the country's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This updated intelligence assessment suggests a more significant impact than an earlier, low-confidence report that estimated a delay of only several months. The new analysis is reportedly based on materials, including B-2 bomber footage, indicating the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The assessment provides a more measured view than President Trump's claim that the program was completely "obliterated."</p>
