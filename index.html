        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial burden during increasingly hot summers, Tokyo will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months. The supplementary budget bill, including 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly session in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the goal is to protect residents' lives and daily living amid declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. Approximately 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving about 5,000 yen on water bills over the four months, though metered usage will still be charged.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has become the first author writing in Kannada to win the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' which explores the hardships of Muslim women in southern India. The stories, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, who shares the £50,000 prize, were praised for their astonishing portraits of survival and resilience. Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and patriarchal society. The book highlights the value of attention to lives lived at the edges and the strength it takes to persist.</p>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings that tragically killed three children, is spearheading the 'Let's Be Blunt' campaign, advocating for the adoption of blunt-tipped knives to reduce the risk of serious injuries. Inspired by her discomfort around knives following the attack, Lucas aims to drive a cultural shift towards safer kitchen tools. She references support from figures like Idris Elba and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who also see the potential benefits of blunt-tipped knives. While manufacturer Viners sells both pointed and blunt-tip knives, Lucas draws parallels to the ban on indoor smoking, emphasizing the need for education and awareness to prevent future knife crime.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses are reporting increasing challenges in operating in China, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and a perceived depreciation of foreign firms. The British Chamber of Commerce in China calls for a more favorable policy environment with clear, fairly enforced rules. Despite these difficulties, British firms continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with and commitment to the Chinese market. Escalating tensions between China and the US are causing many firms to delay investments, both in China and globally, due to China exposure.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never bought rice due to receiving it from supporters, a comment that came amidst a national rice shortage and soaring prices.

The comment drew attention to the government's inability to resolve the rice shortage, which has driven up the cost of a staple food for Japanese households, despite the release of rice from government stockpiles.</p>

The earthquake could also sink coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet, increasing the risk to millions of Americans.

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making Delaware the 11th state with such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults diagnosed with a terminal illness and given six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. The law requires patients to be presented with other end-of-life care options, two waiting periods, and a second medical opinion. Supporters argue the measure is about compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice, while opponents raise concerns about the sanctity of life.</p>

          <p>A recent study has found that high-dose radiotherapy, while effective in targeting and destroying cancer cells, may paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. The research, conducted at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre, indicates that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly receiving radiation therapy. This finding suggests that radiation therapy could have unintended consequences and may require further investigation.</p>
