          <h2>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz Expected to Depart Following Signal App Controversy</h2>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is anticipated to leave his position in the Trump administration after facing scrutiny for creating a Signal messaging group where U.S. military plans were discussed, inadvertently including The Atlantic's Editor Jeffrey Goldberg. Goldberg reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth detailed plans for attacks on Houthi forces in Yemen within the group, which included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. Waltz's departure would be the first major official exit since the beginning of President Trump's second term, although Trump had previously stated that Waltz's job was secure. Deputy national security advisor Alex Wong is also expected to leave his job as well, adding to the sense of upheaval within the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>DuPont and Honeywell shares have experienced lackluster performance amid plans to split into separate publicly traded companies, a phenomenon known as "spin purgatory" on Wall Street. DuPont's shares initially rose after announcing its split into three entities but later declined, impacted by President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. Honeywell's stock also saw initial gains following its spin-off announcement but experienced volatility until the company officially declared its intentions to split into three entities.

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal to establish a joint investment fund for rebuilding Ukraine after the conflict with Russia, though the agreement omits a security guarantee sought by Kyiv. The deal, signed during President Trump's 100th day in office, aims to exploit Ukraine's untapped mineral resources through a 50-50 investment fund managed jointly by both countries. While the agreement does not commit the U.S. to a security guarantee, it signals a long-term strategic alignment and potential for increased military aid if a peace deal is not reached. The deal's signing marks a significant shift in Trump's approach to Ukraine, tying him to the country's future and potentially deterring further Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, refuted a Wall Street Journal report that the company was seeking a replacement for CEO Elon Musk, emphasizing the board's confidence in his leadership. The denial follows a 71% drop in quarterly profit and investor concerns about Musk's time commitment to government work with President Trump. Musk's involvement with the Trump administration and right-wing causes has reportedly led to protests and a decline in sales, particularly among liberal and centrist electric vehicle buyers. Tesla's revenue fell by 9% in the first quarter, with competitors like BYD and General Motors gaining market share with new electric models.</p>

Justice Minister Constant Mutamba stated the Senate received a request from the military's attorney general to revoke Kabila's immunity, citing evidence of "war crimes, crimes against humanity, and massacres." Kabila, currently in self-imposed exile in South Africa, faces potential trial in absentia if he does not return to Congo to face justice.

However, demand slowed in late April as new vehicle inventories tightened and prices increased.

However, Rodriguez's order permanently blocks the administration from using the AEA and Mr. Trump's proclamation to detain, transfer, or remove Venezuelan migrants in the Southern District.

          <p>Microsoft has significantly raised prices for its Xbox console worldwide, citing increasing development costs and market conditions, though not explicitly mentioning tariffs. Prices vary by country, with the Xbox Series S increasing by £50 in the UK and the Series X rising by $100-$130 in the US. The price hikes come amid global economic uncertainty fueled by US tariffs, which experts predict will increase consumer prices. Experts suggest the price rise was "inevitable" and "catalysed by current tariff disruptions", potentially impacting Microsoft's sales and triggering broader industry repercussions.</p>

          <p>A new global study reveals that young people's emotional and psychological distress is more pronounced in wealthy, industrialized nations like the United States, but is occurring worldwide. The study, based on a survey of over 200,000 individuals in 22 countries, found that young adults' flourishing scores start low and stay low until they begin to rise around age 50. However, the study identified an exception: a more traditional U-shaped curve among young people with more friends and intimate social relationships. Researchers suggest that growing secularization and a lack of meaning in wealthy countries contribute to the decline in happiness.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and Anthropic are engaged in a public disagreement over U.S. chip export restrictions, with Nvidia criticizing Anthropic's arguments for tighter controls on AI chips. Anthropic, backed by Amazon, argued for stricter enforcement, claiming that Chinese smuggling tactics involved chips hidden in "prosthetic baby bumps" and "packed alongside live lobsters." Nvidia responded by urging American firms to focus on innovation rather than "tell tall tales" about smuggling. The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent China from gaining ground in AI.</p>

Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark expressed concern that many small businesses will suffer irreparable harm even if agreements are reached in weeks or months. The White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller indicated the administration is not considering the request, suggesting that tax relief for small businesses is the preferred solution.</p>

This support for Weinstein reflects a broader anti-Me Too sentiment, with skepticism towards sexual assault accusations and a tendency to discredit accusers.
