          <p>NFL Week Three delivered extraordinary drama, with unheralded kickers and backup quarterbacks dominating a Sunday featuring five last-play finishes. The Philadelphia Eagles mounted their largest home comeback since 1988, blocking a last-gasp field goal by the Los Angeles Rams and returning it for a touchdown to maintain their unbeaten record. The Cleveland Browns also achieved a significant upset, ending an eight-game losing streak by blocking a potential game-winning field goal from the Green Bay Packers and kicking a 55-yarder for their first victory. Other key outcomes included the Kansas City Chiefs' initial win, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 3-0 start, and the surprising 3-0 run of the Indianapolis Colts, highlighted by quarterback Daniel 'Indiana' Jones's historic performance.</p>

          <p>Singapore's core inflation rate unexpectedly softened to 0.3% in August, marking its lowest rise since February 2021 and falling below economists' projections. Headline inflation also decreased to 0.5% from July's 0.6%. This easing trend occurs as the city-state prepares for slower economic growth in the latter half of 2025, despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects core inflation to average 0.5% to 1.5% for 2025, a significant reduction from 2.8% in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Copenhagen and Oslo airports were forced to suspend operations for approximately four hours on Monday night following multiple drone sightings, affecting around 20,000 passengers and diverting at least 35 flights. Danish police described the Copenhagen drones as likely flown by a "capable operator" with no intent to cause harm, though armed forces were activated. While Ukrainian President Zelensky linked the incident to "Russia's violation" of NATO airspace, Danish authorities found no immediate connection between the events in Norway and Denmark. The closures underscore ongoing security vulnerabilities at critical infrastructure points.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an extensive black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized websites use bots and fake identities to resell tickets at inflated prices, often leaving fans with invalid purchases. Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club demonstrated their efforts to combat this issue, highlighting how over a hundred fans, including one who traveled 5,500 miles, were denied entry to a match against Tottenham due to illegitimate tickets. Brighton has invested in new technology and a dedicated investigation officer, Joseph Sells, to identify touts and block fraudulent transactions, preventing an estimated £100,000 in illicit sales during one match alone. The Premier League is also introducing encrypted digital ticketing to make touting more difficult.</p>

          <p>During a rare visit to Beijing, US House Democrat Adam Smith warned that the lack of regular communication between the US and Chinese militaries poses significant dangers. Smith emphasized that as China's military strength and nuclear arsenal rapidly grow, greater engagement is crucial to prevent miscalculations and misunderstandings, especially given advancements in AI and cyberspace.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding previously frozen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge granted a preliminary injunction, citing the government's likely violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific details for the cuts. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million in National Science Foundation grants to UCLA. The frozen funds, primarily for medical research, were part of the administration's broader efforts to pressure elite colleges over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.</p>

He highlights coaches like Luis Enrique adopting his old habit of watching games from the stands for a better overview.

This success is attributed to Sweden's deeply ingrained "equity culture," diverse domestic capital, and supportive regulatory framework. About 70% of Swedish household wealth is in equity, significantly higher than the EU average, fostered by decades of government policies like tax-incentivized savings funds. The market also benefits from an efficient IPO process, including "cornerstone" investors and a steady supply of private equity-backed companies.

His defense argues the jury's verdict signals "affirmative indication of innocence" regarding the gravest accusations, and that he has already served over a year in a notorious jail.

          <p>Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk that served as a battle cry for the Trump administration, depicting opponents as inherently wicked and destined for destruction. The article analyzes Miller's rhetoric, noting his proud insistence on holding enemies to standards he doesn't abide by and his Manichean view of America as deeply divided, where one side must subjugate the other. Miller's speech, filled with bludgeoning repetition, contrasts sharply with Barack Obama's calls for unity and reconciliation, further cementing the perception of Trumpism as a movement defined by ideological purity and a will to power against perceived foes.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne, known for "Adolescence," praises the "remarkable" journalists who exposed widespread phone hacking in the media, ahead of ITV's new drama "The Hack." Starring David Tennant as investigative reporter Nick Davies, the series delves beyond individual journalistic misconduct to reveal troubling relationships between the press, politics, and police. Thorne highlights the show as a celebration of journalists who held their own industry accountable, contrasting it with "Mr Bates vs The Post Office" where journalism initially struggled to gain traction. The article underscores the courage required to expose internal industry problems.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions of advanced H20 lines offered as a compromise by the US. This "no" signals China's prioritization of technological independence, viewing continued purchases as accepting US-dictated tech inferiority. Historically reliant on global supply chains, Beijing's calculus shifted after sweeping US restrictions on high-end AI chips. The article argues that Washington underestimated how its policy would strengthen calls for indigenous innovation within China, transforming self-reliance from a distant dream into a national necessity in the face of perceived technological containment.

          <p>France has formally recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron stating at the UN that "the time for peace has come" and "nothing justifies the ongoing war in Gaza." This move follows similar announcements from several other countries and intensifies international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and West Bank settlements. While the US and some G7 states were absent from a French-Saudi summit on a two-state solution, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Gaza situation "intolerable," emphasizing a two-state solution as the only credible path to peace.</p>

          <p>Disney has reinstated Jimmy Kimmel Live! after suspending the show due to comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which Disney deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The suspension followed threats from the FCC chair and sparked widespread debate over free speech, drawing criticism from politicians, media figures, and free-speech organizations. Kimmel had satirized the Trump administration's reaction to Kirk's death. Disney stated that "thoughtful conversations" led to the decision, though some ABC affiliates, like Sinclair, plan to continue replacing the show with news programming, indicating ongoing fallout from the controversy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest as part of the ancient tradition of pannage, a practice dating back to 1079. Initiated due to a "heavy acorn crop," the pigs graze on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle. This ecological stewardship helps maintain the health of the New Forest ecosystem. Officials remind visitors to keep a safe distance and drive carefully, as reports of pigs being struck by cars have occurred. Pannage season is expected to conclude in late November.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a substantial increase in the H-1B visa fee, raising it from $2,000-$5,000 to $100,000 per application for new applicants. This change, effective immediately, requires employers to document payment before filing petitions, with restrictions for 12 months if payment is delayed. The fee applies only to new H-1B applicants, not renewals or current visa holders, with exceptions for employment deemed essential to national interest. H-1B visas are crucial for highly skilled foreign professionals in STEM fields, particularly from India and China, who fill roles where qualified American workers are scarce.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recommended that pregnant women limit Tylenol use due to a potential, though unproven, link to autism. This stance directly contradicts major medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which affirm acetaminophen as the safest painkiller during pregnancy. While the FDA's subsequent note to doctors was more measured, stating no causal link is established, Trump urged women to "fight like hell" not to take it. Experts warn this advice risks public health confusion and maternal well-being.</p>
