This strategic move could reportedly elevate the crypto company's valuation to an astonishing $500 billion, rivaling major private entities like OpenAI and SpaceX. The substantial capital infusion aims to maximize Tether's strategy, expanding its scale across diverse business lines, including artificial intelligence, commodity trading, and energy.

This article notes a UN official attributed the stop to someone with Trump inadvertently hitting the lever, and Trump himself publicly mocked the UN's infrastructure, linking it to a past rejected renovation bid.</p>
