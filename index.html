          <p>An Internal Revenue Service aide who worked closely with former official Lois Lerner has been fired from the agency. Holly Paz, who served as the IRS Commissioner of the Large Business and International Division, was a key figure during the scandal involving the targeting of conservative groups. This termination follows years of scrutiny over the IRS's handling of applications from organizations with conservative affiliations. The move marks a significant development in the long-running controversy, suggesting ongoing repercussions within the agency from that period. The firing was confirmed by sources to Fox News Digital.</p>

          <p>Israel conducted a strike in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders, an act that directly challenges Qatar's established role as a neutral ground for international diplomacy. While Hamas leaders reportedly survived, the attack signals a potential shift in how Israel and its allies view Qatar's utility as an intermediary, possibly seeing it more as an enabler than a mediator. This operation, allegedly conducted with American consent, undermines the U.S.-backed negotiations and could limit Qatar's influence in resolving regional conflicts. The incident highlights the precarious nature of Qatar's balancing act between hosting controversial groups and maintaining alliances with Western powers.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Coalition for Human Rights in Development alleges that Germany's state-owned KfW, the world's largest development bank, is linked to significant human rights and environmental abuses. The report claims that KfW-funded projects have led to the forced displacement of Indigenous communities in countries like Indonesia and Kenya without proper consent or compensation. It also cites environmental damage from energy projects and criticizes the bank's opaque and inaccessible complaints procedure. The coalition is urging KfW to implement an independent accountability mechanism and improve transparency, similar to standards adopted by other major development banks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a rare public rebuke of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following an Israeli strike against Hamas targets in Doha, Qatar. In a statement, Trump asserted that unilaterally bombing a sovereign nation and close U.S. ally does not advance the goals of either Israel or America. He confirmed being notified of the attack too late to intervene and expressed that he feels "very badly" about the location, assuring Qatari leaders it would not happen again. While maintaining that eliminating Hamas is a worthy objective, Trump's comments underscore the diplomatic strain caused by the operation in a key mediating country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily paused a lower court ruling that would have compelled the Trump administration to disburse nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds. Chief Justice John Roberts issued the stay after the administration appealed a federal judge's order to spend the money, which President Trump had sought to cancel through a "pocket rescission." The funds, previously approved by Congress, were designated for UN programs, peacekeeping, and democracy-promotion projects.

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine designed to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has severely impacted their populations. Developed over a decade by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the single-dose vaccine has been shown to reduce mortality by at least 65% in wild populations. Chlamydia is a major killer of koalas, causing blindness, infertility, and death, with infection rates reaching as high as 70% in some colonies. This approval is a crucial step towards a national rollout, offering significant hope for the conservation of the iconic Australian marsupial.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case determining the legality of the Trump administration's broad global tariffs, scheduling arguments for November. The case challenges President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose levies, a move that lower courts have ruled exceeded his authority. This will be a major test of presidential power, with significant economic implications. If the Supreme Court upholds the lower court rulings, it could invalidate the tariffs and potentially force the U.S. to refund billions of dollars collected, disrupting existing and future trade agreements.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants, following intense customer backlash against its recent modernization efforts. The decision comes just weeks after the company reversed a controversial logo change that had been criticized by conservatives for being "woke." The chain stated that it heard customer feedback that the proposed contemporary interior designs did not align with the beloved "Old Country Store" aesthetic. This move reinforces the company's commitment to its traditional, vintage Americana brand identity, including its classic logo, front-porch rocking chairs, and fireplaces.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, two of the five Supreme Court justices have cast votes finding him guilty of plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss. A conviction requires at least one more guilty vote from the remaining three justices. The first two justices to vote, Alexandre de Moraes and Flávio Dino, found Bolsonaro guilty on all charges, with Moraes stating there was "no doubt" of a coup attempt. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face over 40 years in prison for his alleged role in organizing a plot to prevent his successor from taking office.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister has resigned following massive, youth-led protests across the country, during which at least 22 people have been killed in clashes with police. The unrest was initially triggered by a government ban on popular social media platforms, which has since been repealed, but has grown to encompass widespread frustration over government corruption. The demonstrators, largely identifying as Gen Z, have engaged in violent confrontations, setting fire to government buildings in Kathmandu. This movement, mobilized online, reflects deep-seated anger among young Nepalis regarding inequality and the perceived lavish lifestyles of the political elite.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu as the new prime minister after the previous government collapsed following a no-confidence vote. Lecornu, 39, is a longtime Macron loyalist and becomes the fourth prime minister in just over a year, reflecting ongoing political instability in France. His immediate and primary task is to negotiate a national budget with the country's divided political parties to avoid further legislative deadlock. The appointment comes as France faces significant challenges, including internal budget difficulties and a planned day of mass protests.</p>

          <p>Police in Washington state have arrested a 13-year-old boy who they believe had "everything ready to go" to commit a mass shooting. A SWAT team raid on the boy's home uncovered a cache of 23 firearms, ammunition, and writings indicative of a planned attack. The arrest was made after an internet watch group reported threatening online posts made by the suspect. Investigators found that many of the guns lacked serial numbers, and some appeared to be homemade using a 3D printer. The boy has pleaded not guilty to several charges and is being held in a juvenile detention center.</p>

          <p>Stage 16 of the Vuelta a Espana cycling race was shortened after being disrupted by pro-Palestinian protests targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team. This is the latest in a series of disruptions that have affected the Grand Tour event. Race director Javier Guillen condemned the protests as "illegal" but confirmed that the race will continue as planned, with no "Plan B" for its scheduled finish in Madrid. The protests highlight the spillover of geopolitical tensions into international sporting events, as organizers vow to defend the race against further interruptions while navigating the complex political landscape.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was briefly taken into custody by Los Angeles police following a dispute over a parking spot. The incident occurred while Cruz was washing his car, and he allegedly sprayed water on three women who parked very close to him and began recording him with their phones. His agent claims any spraying was inadvertent as Cruz turned to ask them to stop, while the women reported it as an intentional assault. Cruz was held for five hours, but no charges have been filed, and his representative expects the case to be dropped.</p>

          <p>An Italian journalist has defended herself after facing backlash for excluding actress Ayo Edebiri from a question about the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements during a press event. The journalist, Federica Polidoro, directed her question specifically to Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield, asking what was "lost during the politically correct era." Edebiri interjected to state that the work of these movements is not done. Polidoro responded to the criticism by condemning what she called cyberbullying and asserting that journalism's role is to ask questions, even on delicate topics, without being muzzled.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a federal criminal charge against the man accused of fatally stabbing 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina. The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., is charged with causing a death on a mass transportation system, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated her office will seek the maximum penalty, citing the case as a result of "failed soft-on-crime policies."

          <p>Russia has intensified its air attacks on Ukraine, with a recent strike using an Iskander cruise missile on a key government building in Kyiv. Although the missile did not detonate, the attack signifies a clear escalation. Simultaneously, Russia's tactics have become deadlier in other regions, as a glide bomb killed more than 20 elderly civilians queuing for their pensions in the Donbas village of Yarova. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks as "savage" and reiterated his urgent plea for more advanced air defense systems and stronger sanctions to stop Russia's access to weapons components.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's recent airstrike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar, is being interpreted as a strong signal that a negotiated end to the Gaza war is unlikely. The attack occurred as Hamas leaders were reportedly discussing a U.S. ceasefire proposal, suggesting Israel remains committed to a military victory over a diplomatic one. This move undermines the role of Qatar as a mediator and raises questions about the viability of future negotiations. With Israel also ordering the evacuation of Gaza City for a new ground offensive, the strike reinforces the belief that the conflict is poised for further escalation rather than resolution.</p>
