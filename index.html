          <p>During a visit to Greenland, US Vice President JD Vance criticized Denmark for its perceived insufficient investment in Greenland's security and its vulnerability to China and Russia.  Vance urged Greenlanders towards self-determination and closer ties with the US, while downplaying President Trump's more forceful annexation rhetoric.  The BBC's reporting presents a relatively neutral account, though the focus on Vance's criticisms might subtly favor the US perspective.</p>
