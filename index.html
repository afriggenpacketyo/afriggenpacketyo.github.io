          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, has been sentenced to 12 years in state prison for defrauding an elderly woman out of $1 million in life savings through a Ponzi scheme. Cohen-Roth befriended the 66-year-old victim while preparing her taxes and offered her fraudulent 'investment opportunities' promising high interest and no risk. The article details how Cohen-Roth used the victim's money, including funds from a reverse mortgage, to pay off earlier investors and support a lavish lifestyle. The scheme collapsed when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute, and the judge reduced Cohen-Roth's sentence due to her age.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, a recognized name in personal finance, is urging Americans to increase their financial literacy and is calling for better financial education in the U.S. The article details that Edelman believes the U.S. lacks a tradition of encouraging smart personal finance, which is problematic given longer lifespans. He is concerned that younger investors are drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and that corporate America complicates consumer finance with overly sophisticated products. Edelman advocates for mandatory personal finance courses in high schools and cautions young investors to seek information from credible sources.</p>
