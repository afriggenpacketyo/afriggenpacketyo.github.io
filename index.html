          <p>Freight Technologies, a trucking logistics firm, purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin to advocate for fair trade amid concerns over President Trump's new tariffs. The company's CFO, Donald Quinby, stated the purchase was an opportunity to make a splash and get the president's attention, particularly since the Trump family announced an "intimate private dinner" with the president for top Trump Coin buyers. Experts raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, comparing the situation to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration. Despite not immediately gaining access, Freight Technologies is prepared to invest up to $20 million in $TRUMP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate blocked California's plan to phase out new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, a move that could impact the electric car market nationwide. The 51-44 vote, seen as a victory for the oil and gas industry, utilized a controversial legislative tactic denounced by Democrats. California Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to challenge the decision, arguing it harms the state's economy, health, and global competitiveness. The repeal comes as the Trump administration weakens federal emission limits and promotes fossil fuel development, potentially hindering the transition to zero-emission vehicles.</p>

However, the full deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000.

          <p>American Airlines' CFO, Devon May, stated that some travelers are avoiding Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions, opting for other options in the area. The FAA has ordered airlines to temporarily cut flights at Newark to relieve congestion caused by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has also contributed to recent disruptions. May cautioned that the impact of travelers avoiding Newark is "modest," with some shifting to LaGuardia, JFK, or Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Congress has voted to undo a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls toxic air pollutants emitted by industrial facilities, marking the first time environmental protections have been rolled back since the law's creation. Environmental groups condemn the move, warning of increased pollution and harm to human health. The vote targets a rule finalized by the Biden administration, which reimposed regulations on facilities emitting "super pollutants" like mercury and dioxins. Industry groups welcomed the decision, citing reduced compliance costs, while experts warn of higher pollution levels in communities near industrial facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The possibility of an annuity running out of money depends on the type of annuity. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide a steady income stream for life, while fixed-term annuities pay out for a set number of years. Variable or indexed annuities can be tied to investment performance, potentially depleting the cash value. Strategies to safeguard annuity payments include choosing a lifetime income annuity, adding an income rider, diversifying retirement income, researching the insurance company, and monitoring withdrawal habits.

Eliminating the subminimum wage would help alleviate poverty and ensure fair compensation for all workers.
