          <p>China-Philippine relations face a reckoning as President Marcos' efforts to diminish the influence of the Duterte camp have fallen short. Rodrigo Duterte is poised to remain a prominent political figure, potentially running for president in 2028, which could lead to a shift in the Philippines' approach to China. The preliminary results of the midterm elections indicate that Duterte's allies are likely to secure enough seats to avoid her impeachment, further solidifying her position.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's hostile approach to South Africa is being shaped by a convergence of factors, including meetings with Afrikaner activists and a focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs. The administration is welcoming white South Africans as refugees after suspending the program for others. This policy shift follows months of diplomatic tension between the two nations, including the expulsion of South Africa’s ambassador. President Trump's views on white farmers in South Africa are influencing U.S. foreign policy, with the administration citing concerns about discrimination and persecution.</p>

This decision suggests that Putin will not meet face-to-face with Ukrainian President Zelensky. President Trump also indicated he would not attend, but that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be present. Zelensky said he was waiting to see who would come from Russia before deciding on Ukraine's next steps and urged the West to impose strong sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting.</p>
