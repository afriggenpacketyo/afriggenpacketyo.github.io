Cagle, a convicted felon, was apprehended after making threats during a FaceTime call and was later found with an AR-15-style rifle and ammunition in his truck at the airport. Authorities credit a "See Something, Say Something" report from a family member and swift law enforcement action for averting a potential tragedy.

          <p>Paul Ingrassia has withdrawn his nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel after allegations surfaced regarding offensive text messages he reportedly sent. The texts, published by Politico, included claims of having "a Nazi streak" and referring to Martin Luther King Jr. as "the 1960s George Floyd." Ingrassia cited insufficient Republican votes for his withdrawal, while his lawyer suggested the messages were satirical and potentially manipulated by AI. The controversy led to bipartisan pushback, with several GOP senators indicating they would not support his confirmation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports increased by 4.2% year-on-year in September, ending a four-month decline, primarily driven by strong growth in shipments to Asia, especially China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped by 13.3%, largely due to a significant fall in auto shipments despite a recent trade deal reducing tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth. The data follows the appointment of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female Prime Minister, whose loose monetary policy is expected to weaken the yen and boost exports. (not investment advice)</p>

This market reaction occurred despite Japan's overall exports rebounding, as shipments to the U.S. continued to fall and overall export growth missed analyst expectations. The new cabinet under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was sworn in, with market participants assessing the implications of her economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly demanded $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice for its criminal investigations into his conduct, dating back to before his first term. These administrative claims relate to the DOJ's probe into 2016 election interference and the FBI's 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump stated that any decision on such a payment would "have to go across my desk," raising significant ethical concerns given that his appointed officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, would review the claims. Trump indicated he would donate any received funds to charity.</p>

The company focuses on seasonal attractions, with Halloween now rivaling summer in profitability, and invests in big brand partnerships like Bluey, PAW Patrol, and Minecraft to draw families away from screens. Eastwood advocates for a VAT cut on hospitality to foster growth.</p>

Arteta believes this performance will ignite a prolific spell for the £64m signing, who has played more than anticipated due to a teammate's injury. The team's celebration of Gyokeres' goals underscored the squad's unity and appreciation for his physical play and ability to create space, making Arsenal a "much better team."</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General is suing House Speaker Mike Johnson to compel the swearing-in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who won a special election in September. Grijalva's seating is stalled, with Johnson citing the government shutdown, but Grijalva believes it's to prevent her from signing a discharge petition to release the Epstein files. Her signature would provide the 218th vote needed to force a House vote on the files, a move she strongly supports. The lawsuit argues that Johnson is unlawfully disenfranchising an entire district and suppressing representation to block justice for Epstein survivors.</p>
