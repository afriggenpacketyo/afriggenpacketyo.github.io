          <p>The family of Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, reports that he was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank while visiting relatives. Musallet was allegedly protecting his family's land when the attack occurred, and his family claims an ambulance was blocked from reaching him for hours. The U.S. State Department confirmed a citizen's death and is providing consular assistance, while the family calls for a U.S.-led investigation into the incident. The event highlights ongoing tensions and violence in the region, with a second Palestinian man also reportedly killed in the attacks.</p>

          <p>Investigators in Tuam, Ireland, have begun a multi-year excavation of a site where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of approximately 796 babies and young children. The children died at the St. Mary's mother-and-baby home, a church-run institution for unmarried women and their children that operated from 1925 to 1961. The grave's existence was brought to light by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, whose research uncovered death certificates for the children but no corresponding burial records. The excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited, painful truth to light for survivors and relatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the imposition of 30% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited Mexico's insufficient efforts to curb migrant and drug trafficking and addressed long-term trade deficits with the EU as justifications for the new policy. The move represents a significant escalation in Trump's trade strategy, disrupting established global trade norms and prompting concern from both Mexico and the EU. Both entities have expressed their disagreement and indicated they will seek a negotiated solution while preparing for potential countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a commanding 4-1 victory over eight-time champion Germany, Sweden's women's national team is expressing strong belief in its ability to win the Euro 2025 tournament. The win secured them the top spot in Group C and marked their first Euros victory against Germany in seven meetings. Midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd stated there is "something different" about the squad this year and that they have the potential to go "the whole way." The team, which won the inaugural tournament in 1984 but has not lifted the trophy since, celebrated the significant win with a large contingent of traveling Swedish fans.</p>

In Texas, Illinois, and Georgia, the peak time for fatal crashes is between 9:00 p.m. and 9:59 p.m. Four other states, including New York and Ohio, see the most danger between 6:00 p.m. and 6:59 p.m., highlighting the risks associated with dusk and post-work travel.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as President Biden’s physician, repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a deposition with the House Oversight Committee. The committee had subpoenaed Dr. O'Connor to answer questions regarding the former president's fitness for office. Committee Chairman James Comer suggested the refusal to answer implies a cover-up, while Democrats argued it was a valid exercise of constitutional rights and a protection of patient confidentiality. Dr. O'Connor's lawyers stated the decision was based on a separate Department of Justice investigation and the ethical duty to protect patient information, not an admission of wrongdoing.</p>

In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site stated they were satisfied with what they saw, with one senator calling the beds comfortable.

While AI is often blamed for exacerbating demographic challenges by replacing human roles, some experts suggest this technological shift may not be entirely negative.

          <p>The Trump administration has continued its purge of the Justice Department, firing more than 20 employees who worked on investigations related to the president, including the classified documents and January 6th cases. Sources indicate that at least 35 staffers from former Special Counsel Jack Smith's team have been terminated, with more firings potentially to come. The employees were reportedly identified by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review Biden-era law enforcement policies. A fired public affairs specialist warned that the line between the White House and the DOJ is "very definitely gone," raising concerns about retribution.</p>

          <p>The third day of the Test match between England and India concluded with tensions flaring over accusations of time-wasting. England's opening batter Zak Crawley used delays, including calling for a physio, to ensure he only had to face one over before the close of play, angering Indian players. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, defended the tactic as part of the game and pointed to India's own delays earlier in the match, including captain Shubman Gill receiving a massage on the field. The animated exchange highlights the strategic gamesmanship and high stakes involved in the tightly contested cricket series.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is publicly defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project against escalating attacks from the Trump administration. In response to claims of a "grossly mismanaged" and "ostentatious overhaul," the central bank updated its website with a FAQ page to counter specific criticisms, clarifying that no new VIP dining rooms are being built. The Fed also explained that cost increases, which are about $700 million over budget, resulted from design changes and unforeseen conditions like asbestos. This public pushback signals the Fed's readiness to contest the administration's campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell and the institution's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

The arrests, primarily for showing support for a banned organization, occurred at protests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester. The proscription, which makes membership or support for the group a criminal offense, followed an incident where activists damaged aircraft at an RAF base. Critics, including the protest organizers, argue the government is misusing terror legislation to suppress dissent against its support for Israel, while officials maintain the group's criminal activities threaten national security.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek's dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the Wimbledon final was a surprising culmination of her dedicated effort to master grass, her weakest surface. Having previously been known as the "Queen of Clay," the 24-year-old's first tour-level title on grass came after a period of mixed results and personal challenges, including a one-month ban for a contaminated sample. Analysts credit her victory to a renewed mindset, more focused practice time on the surface, and technical improvements to her movement and serve under her new coach. Swiatek herself called the win "surreal," stating that she keeps surprising herself with her achievements.</p>

Officials have closed the North Rim and ordered all residents and visitors to evacuate immediately due to the fire's rapid progression.

          <p>An aviation expert suggests that a chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, is the likely cause behind the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad last month. Analyzing the preliminary report, which noted that the engine fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously, former pilot Marco Chan points to a known issue with a chip in the engine's control system. A service bulletin had previously advised maintenance on this chip to prevent signal loss, which could command the fuel to be cut off. This technical analysis provides a potential explanation for how both engines lost power, leading to the crash that killed 260 people.</p>
