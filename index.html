          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amidst growing concerns over President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the Japanese economy. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for an extended period, the central bank acknowledged that Japan's economic growth is likely to moderate due to a global slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. The BOJ indicated it would continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but trade tensions complicate these plans. The central bank expects inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5 to 2% in fiscal year 2026.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since losing the 2024 election, criticizing the Trump administration's policies. Speaking at an Emerge America event in San Francisco, Harris accused the administration of abandoning American ideals and instilling fear. She specifically targeted Trump's trade war, labeling it the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history," and warned that his tariffs are inviting a recession by hurting workers and businesses. Harris also addressed the administration's immigration policies, condemning the detention and deportation of American citizens without due process. The former vice president ended her speech by calling on Americans to stand together and defend the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5%, a sharp decrease from the 1.1% projected earlier. This revision comes as President Trump's tariffs, including those on imported cars, are already weighing heavily on Japan's economy. The central bank's decision to keep interest rates steady reflects the uncertainty caused by these tariffs and their potential to undermine the country's economic recovery. The article also notes that Japanese consumers have been reluctant to spend due to inflation outpacing wage increases.</p>

          <p>Microsoft appears to be weathering the storm of President Trump's tariffs with minimal direct impact on its core business. During an earnings call, Microsoft's finance chief noted that tariff uncertainty had led to elevated inventory levels for personal computers and Windows operating system licenses. CEO Satya Nadella suggested that software could help companies mitigate inflationary pressures caused by tariffs. Microsoft's shares rose after the call, driven by strong revenue and earnings reports. While Microsoft faces potential cost increases related to its investments in AI infrastructure, the company's diverse portfolio and focus on software provide some insulation from the direct effects of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Meta's finance chief Susan Li reported that Chinese online retailers have decreased their advertising spending on Facebook and Instagram due to President Trump's trade policies. This reduction is likely in anticipation of the end of de minimis trade exemptions for Chinese imports. While some of the ad spend has been redirected to other markets, overall spending from these advertisers is lower than before April. This trend echoes similar warnings from Google and Snap about headwinds in the Asia-Pacific advertising market. Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell short of Wall Street projections for the first quarter.</p>

          <p>The estranged husband of Erin Patterson, accused of serving a poisonous mushroom lunch that resulted in three deaths, testified that it was unusual for her to host gatherings at home. Simon Patterson, who declined to attend the lunch himself, described Erin as intelligent and witty. He noted that she had a good relationship with his parents, who were among the victims. The prosecution alleges that Erin invited the group under the false pretense of having cancer. The jury has heard evidence that Ms. Patterson allegedly lied to investigators about the source of the mushrooms and disposed of a food dehydrator.</p>

Musk countered by stating that China is now a much larger consumer of manufactured goods, highlighting that Chinese consumers will purchase more cars than America and Europe combined this year. This exchange underscores a debate about the shifting global economic landscape and the potential transfer of economic leverage from the U.S. to China.</p>

Jera aims to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation by utilizing the LNG-fired plant, which can easily control output. With Japan planning to rely heavily on renewable and nuclear energy, LNG is expected to bridge the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.</p>

          <p>A Maryland judge, Paula Xinis, is pressing the Trump administration for information regarding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Xinis has accused the administration of acting in "bad faith" and has set deadlines for them to answer outstanding discovery requests. Senator Chris Van Hollen has also been vocal about the case, calling for Abrego Garcia's return and criticizing the administration's handling of the situation. The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia's deportation was an error but accuses him of gang affiliation, which his lawyers deny. The case has drawn attention to due process and constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly holding off on engaging in serious trade negotiations with the United States, awaiting clarity on which of President Trump's advisors holds the most influence and how other countries will react to the temporary pause on tariffs. Sources suggest that the Trump administration's internal divisions on trade policy are causing reluctance in Beijing. Top trade advisors have differing views on dealing with China, ranging from protectionist stances to a belief in reaching a trade deal. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's final decision makes China hesitant to reveal its negotiating strategies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. The judge found that Apple created a new system that forced apps with external sales to pay a 27 percent commission, despite a previous order to allow developers to display links to alternative payment options. Apple was also accused of creating pop-up screens that discouraged customers from paying elsewhere. The judge has referred the matter to the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.</p>
