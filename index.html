          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 03:58:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study by the Open Technology Fund has uncovered alarming security and privacy risks in several widely-used VPN services. The report highlights issues such as opaque ownership structures, with some popular VPNs secretly controlled by Chinese nationals, making them subject to China's information control laws. These providers, including Turbo VPN and VPN Proxy Master, were found to use weak security protocols and hard-coded passwords, potentially exposing hundreds of millions of users to surveillance and data decryption. The study advises users to opt for transparent, paid services or the Tor browser for genuine privacy.</p>

          <p>Portugal has declared its intention to officially recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing number of Western countries shifting their diplomatic stance amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The announcement was made ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, with nations like France, the UK, and Australia reportedly preparing similar moves. This policy shift has been denounced by Israel and its primary ally, the United States, who argue that it rewards terrorism following the Hamas-led attack in October 2023. Approximately three-quarters of UN member states already recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in workplaces to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and managing workloads, potentially saving companies thousands per employee annually. Tools like ChatGPT can act as assistants, reducing cognitive load and flagging at-risk employees for early intervention. However, some studies suggest that frequent AI users report higher levels of burnout, as the technology can create pressure to take on more work and requires new skills to use effectively. Experts caution that relying on AI to replace headcount rather than augment employees can inadvertently fuel the very problem it is meant to solve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has announced a policy to open police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The initiative aims to improve public confidence in policing and make it easier for citizens to report crimes and provide information. Party officials state the plan would be funded by abolishing the roles of elected police and crime commissioners, a move they claim would free up over £100 million. The proposal comes in response to a decline in traditional police station front counters and is a key announcement at the party's annual conference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order mandating a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, citing a need to prevent "abuse" of the program. The policy, set to take effect on September 21, aims to encourage companies to hire American workers first. The move has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue it will devastate small businesses and startups and hinder the U.S.'s ability to attract global talent. Major tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft are the largest beneficiaries of the current H-1B program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is launching its own version of the Eurovision Song Contest, a revived Soviet-era competition called Intervision, positioned as a conservative alternative to the Western event. The contest, backed by President Vladimir Putin, aims to promote "traditional values" and will feature participants from 23 countries, including BRICS members like China and Brazil. Russian artists have been banned from Eurovision since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and this event underscores the growing cultural and political divide. Russian officials have contrasted Intervision with Eurovision's pro-LGBTQ+ stance, reflecting the country's increasingly restrictive social policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a "Gold Card" program that offers an expedited path to permanent residency for foreign nationals who make a gift of at least $1 million to the U.S. Commerce Department. The program will make 80,000 such visas available and is intended to replace some existing employment-based green card categories. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that contributing $1 million is a way to prove "exceptional value" to the United States. The administration is also considering a "Platinum Card" for a $5 million fee, which would offer tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old hiker from Argentina, Matias Augusto Travizano, died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down Wintun Glacier on Mount Shasta in Northern California. After successfully reaching the summit, Travizano became lost on the descent and attempted a controlled slide down an ice sheet, but lost control and collided with a boulder. Although he briefly regained consciousness, he was dislodged and fell the remaining distance. This marks the second fatality on the mountain's "easiest" route in just over a month, prompting officials to warn climbers about its treacherous and easily misjudged conditions.</p>

          <p>The Speaker of the UK House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has expressed serious concern that Parliament is now more vulnerable to foreign espionage. His warning follows the Crown Prosecution Service's decision to drop charges against two men accused of spying for China, citing insufficient evidence. Sir Lindsay stated he was "very unhappy" with the decision and is considering a private legal action to address the security risks. The move to drop the case has also been criticized by the Home Office, which highlighted the seriousness of the original allegations against the two men.</p>

          <p>A crucial global treaty to protect marine biodiversity in international waters is set to become law after Morocco became the 60th nation to ratify it. The High Seas Treaty, which has been in development for two decades, will allow for the creation of marine protected areas in waters beyond national jurisdiction. Currently, only 1% of the high seas are protected, leaving them vulnerable to overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Environmental groups have hailed the milestone as a "monumental achievement" and a turning point for ocean conservation, enabling the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position. His departure comes amid concerns that he was facing removal for not bringing a federal mortgage fraud case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political rival of the president. President Trump confirmed he wanted Siebert out, citing his support from Democratic senators during his confirmation process. James had previously led a successful civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his business. The resignation highlights tensions regarding the independence of the Justice Department.</p>
