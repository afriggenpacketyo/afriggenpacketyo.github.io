          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his vision for "personal superintelligence," a form of advanced AI designed to empower individuals by helping them achieve personal and professional goals. He believes this technology, which surpasses human cognition, will usher in an era of personal empowerment rather than just creating abundance. Zuckerberg also highlighted the role of AI-integrated glasses, developed in partnership with Ray-Ban, as the future primary computing devices that will see and hear what users do. This initiative is part of Meta's broader strategic push into advanced artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip technology firm Arm Holdings experienced a significant dip in after-hours trading after the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported revenue of $1.05 billion, just below the anticipated $1.06 billion, while earnings per share met projections at 35 cents. Arm, which provides architecture for chips used in billions of devices, including those from Apple and Qualcomm, provided a second-quarter revenue forecast that was in line with market estimates. The slight revenue miss prompted a negative reaction from investors in the highly watched semiconductor sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Councils had warned the government of a "risk to life" and requested a loan that was not provided.

          <p>Meta's stock price increased significantly after the company reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed the strong performance to AI advancements enhancing the efficiency of the company's advertising systems. Meta also issued a third-quarter sales forecast that exceeded Wall Street estimates and announced increased capital expenditures, partly due to a major investment in the AI firm Scale AI. Despite these gains, the Reality Labs division continued to operate at a substantial loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifty years after his disappearance on July 30, 1975, the fate of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa remains one of America's most enduring unsolved mysteries. Hoffa, a powerful and controversial labor leader with deep ties to organized crime, was last seen outside a Detroit-area restaurant where he was believed to be meeting with mob figures. Despite countless theories, extensive investigations, and numerous searches over the decades, what happened to him has never been confirmed. The FBI case officially remains open, and Hoffa's legacy continues to capture public fascination, cementing his status as a legendary figure in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Senator Rand Paul stated he would support abolishing the Federal Reserve, provided that the U.S. government stops deficit spending and operates with a balanced budget. A longtime critic of the central bank, Paul argued that the free market, not the Fed, should determine interest rates, which he described as the most prolific price in the economy. He criticized demands for rate cuts as a form of price manipulation, similar to nonsensically demanding a president lower the price of meat. Paul is also championing a bill to audit the Federal Reserve, which he calls one of the most powerful and secretive government organizations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal gambling business out of a California home he owned. Federal prosecutors allege Arenas and five co-conspirators, including a suspected member of an Israeli organized crime group, ran high-stakes poker games at the mansion. Arenas, whose successful basketball career was marred by off-court issues, faces charges of conspiracy, operating an illegal gambling business, and making false statements to investigators. The indictment details how the home was staged for the games, with women allegedly hired to serve drinks and provide companionship to players.</p>

          <h2>New US-EU Trade Deal Criticized for Potentially Locking Europe into Fossil Fuel Dependency</h2>

          <p>A new trade agreement, which could see the EU import over $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years, is facing criticism from environmental groups. They warn that the deal, which focuses heavily on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to replace Russian supplies, could lock Europe into decades of fossil fuel dependency. Critics argue this contradicts the EU's Green Deal and climate goals, as LNG production and transport have a higher emissions footprint than pipeline gas. While the deal was struck to avert a trade war, it is seen by some as a significant U-turn on Europe's climate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced it is suspending the "de minimis" exemption, a rule that has allowed commercial packages valued at $800 or less to enter the United States without facing tariffs. Under an executive order signed by President Trump, these low-value shipments will be subject to all applicable duties starting August 29. The move accelerates a change already included in recent legislation, which was set to repeal the exemption worldwide in 2027. The administration stated it is acting more quickly to address national emergencies and protect American businesses from untaxed foreign competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are contemplating a change to chamber rules to speed up the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees, citing what they call an "unprecedented level of obstruction" by Democrats. Democrats have been using procedural tactics to slow-walk nearly all of Trump's appointments in protest of his policies. Majority Leader John Thune stated that interest in changing the rules is growing quickly within the GOP caucus. A potential rule change would represent another significant shift for the traditionally change-resistant institution and further escalate partisan tensions over presidential appointments.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro for an alleged coup plot. The U.S. Treasury accused the judge of suppressing free expression and conducting a "witch hunt." Simultaneously, President Donald Trump signed an executive order raising tariffs on many Brazilian goods to 50%, directly linking the action to what he termed the "politically motivated persecution" of his ally, Bolsonaro.

Preservationists argued the motel is a rare and intact example from the glory days of roadside tourism in Hollywood.

A key piece of evidence, a male DNA profile found on one of the victims, has been the focus of the investigation. Although a promising lead from a public database in 2017 was later ruled out, investigators believe that further advancements in DNA science could eventually identify the person responsible from the limited sample that still exists.</p>
