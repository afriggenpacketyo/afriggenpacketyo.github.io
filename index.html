          <p>President Trump indicated the U.S. aims to strike trade deals with Japan and South Korea soon, with letters outlining deal terms to be sent to various countries within weeks. Simultaneously, the Defense Department is expected to reject most of the 20,000 troops requested by DHS for migrant arrests, raising concerns about federal law violations. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth defended the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amidst objections from Democrats about their domestic deployment. A $9.4 billion spending cut package, backed by DOGE, faces a House vote, potentially impacting funding for PBS and NPR. Optimism regarding these complex political and economic issues remains cautiously moderate.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have reportedly been informed that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting U.S. anticipation of potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in Iraq. This concern contributed to the State Department's advisory for some Americans to leave the region due to heightened tensions. Despite these developments, President Trump's Middle East envoy is still planning to meet with Iran for further nuclear program talks. The situation remains fluid, with officials declining to comment on the specifics of potential actions, though the U.S. maintains it will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics indicates a rise in gun deaths among children in states with more permissive firearm laws following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling. States like Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, and Georgia saw increases in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearm restrictions. The study compared data from before and after the ruling, finding a significant jump in youth deaths in states with the most permissive laws. Conversely, states with stricter laws, such as California, saw a decrease in children's gun deaths, highlighting the impact of legal posture on preventing youth firearms deaths.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from fossils housed in a Mongolian museum, which is believed to be the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. The 86-million-year-old skeletons reveal an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants of the dinosaur world. This discovery helps to revise the tyrannosaur family tree and provides insights into the evolution of key features, such as skull anatomy for a strong jaw. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how tyrannosaurs became powerful predators in North America and Asia.</p>
