          <p>Levita Almuete Ferrer, a former State Department budget analyst, pleaded guilty to stealing more than $650,000 from the agency over two years. Ferrer abused her signature authority over a State Department checking account, writing 60 checks to herself and three to an acquaintance. She attempted to conceal the scheme by falsifying entries in a Quickbooks account, changing payees to legitimate State Department vendors after printing the checks. Ferrer faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and has agreed to pay full restitution to the U.S. government. Optimism that the State Department's internal controls will be improved as a result of the case are middling.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was arrested and tried for the murder of his wife, Kendy Howard, whose death was initially reported as a suicide. First responders found Kendy dead in a bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, but several clues at the scene raised suspicions, including broken glass, wet towels, and a packed duffle bag. Most notably, the clothes dryer was running with only six minutes left on the cycle, started just before Howard called 911. Investigators theorized Howard killed Kendy and staged the scene to look like a suicide.</p>

The article also explores the challenges Reform faces in transitioning from a protest party to a party capable of governing.
