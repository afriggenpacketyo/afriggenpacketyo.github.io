          <p>A BBC Verify investigation has concluded that Israel struck Gaza's Nasser Hospital at least four times during a deadly attack, contrary to initial reports of two strikes. The analysis of video footage revealed two initial, nearly simultaneous blasts at different staircases, followed by a "double-tap" strike nine minutes later where two separate projectiles hit milliseconds apart. This new evidence raises further questions about the attack, which killed at least 20 people including journalists, and whether it violated international law protecting medical facilities during conflict.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has fired a total of four employees following a protest and break-in at the office of company president Brad Smith. The demonstration was organized by the group "No Azure for Apartheid," which is comprised of tech workers demanding the company sever ties with Israel. The protest was prompted by reports that the Israeli military uses Microsoft's Azure cloud platform for surveillance of Palestinians. Microsoft stated the terminations were due to serious violations of company policy and safety concerns, and an investigation into Israel's use of Azure is underway.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama has voiced concerns over what he termed "dangerous trends" from the Trump administration, specifically criticizing President Trump's suggestion to deploy the National Guard to combat crime in cities like Chicago. Obama warned that the increasing federalization and militarization of local police functions, along with an erosion of due process, could put the liberties of all Americans at risk. The critique comes as Trump has publicly pressured Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker to request federal assistance for Chicago's crime rate, a suggestion Democratic leaders have strongly rejected.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone assault on Kyiv has resulted in at least 15 deaths, including four children, and left dozens more injured in one of the most significant attacks on the capital in weeks. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched nearly 600 drones and over 30 missiles across the country, hitting numerous civilian buildings, including a residential block. The attack has drawn international condemnation and occurs amidst struggling U.S.-led peace efforts, with President Zelenskyy calling for stronger sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old child and injuring 18 other people. The 23-year-old suspect, identified as a former student of the attached school, was armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement officials are investigating the incident as a potential act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime, noting the shooter expressed anti-Catholic sentiments and had an obsession with past mass shootings.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Fresno restaurant chain, Robert Salazar, has been charged with arson after allegedly hiring the president of a motorcycle gang to set fire to one of his underperforming locations. Prosecutors claim that after closing the restaurant, Salazar increased its insurance policy by over $100,000 before the fire occurred, subsequently receiving a payout of nearly $1 million. Investigators connected Salazar to the arson through surveillance footage and interviews, and court documents reveal he has an alleged history of using arson to intimidate others.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka reached the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste, continuing her strong performance after a controversial final in Montreal. Osaka revealed she felt "shame" after being criticized for not congratulating her opponent in that match but has since won eight of her last nine matches. After her win, she also commented on the recent controversy involving Jelena Ostapenko's remarks to Taylor Townsend, calling them ill-timed and one of the worst things to say to a Black player in a majority-white sport.</p>

          <p>A group of 40 Rohingya refugees has accused the Indian government of forcibly deporting them to Myanmar by flying them to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, placing them on a naval vessel, and then abandoning them in the Andaman Sea with life jackets. Testimonies gathered by the BBC from the refugees, who are now in a conflict zone in Myanmar, describe being bound and blindfolded during the journey. The UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar stated there is "significant evidence" supporting these allegations, which raise grave concerns about India's treatment of refugees.</p>

          <p>In the midst of the tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, heroic actions by middle school students saved lives. According to officials and parents, older students immediately shielded their younger "buddies" — part of a school mentorship program — by pushing them under the pews and covering them with their own bodies. One student reportedly took a shotgun blast to the back while protecting another child, highlighting the incredible bravery shown by children and staff members during the horrific attack that killed two students.</p>

          <p>An angler's discovery of an unusually large, 26-kilogram grass carp in Lake Huron has prompted a warning from Canadian officials about the highly invasive species. Grass carp pose a significant threat to native ecosystems because they can consume up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native fish and birds. Although this particular fish was sterile, the species is already reproducing in U.S. rivers connected to the Great Lakes, and authorities are urging the public to report any sightings immediately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology may be a net negative for the brand's appeal, with 35% of consumers saying it would make them less likely to buy a Tesla, compared to only 14% who said it would make them more likely. The report from Slingshot Strategies also found that nearly half of those surveyed believe FSD technology should be illegal, highlighting significant public skepticism and safety concerns. These findings present a challenge for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk has positioned the company's future on the success of its autonomous driving services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA), Michael Abramowitz. The judge stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which President Trump effectively dismantled by dismissing most of its members. The ruling is a significant setback for Lake's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Agency for Global Media and VOA, which the judge noted has seen its operations dramatically curtailed contrary to statutory requirements.</p>

          <p>Asylum seekers housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, report being "in the dark" about their future as they face eviction following a High Court injunction. The ruling, which found the hotel's use breached planning laws, comes after months of anti-immigration protests and counter-demonstrations at the site. One asylum seeker from Somalia described the hostility from some locals and the uncertainty of their situation, even as he expressed understanding for the anger surrounding mass migration, highlighting the complex and tense nature of the issue.</p>
