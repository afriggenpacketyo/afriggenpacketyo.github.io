          <p>The Trump administration has ordered colleges to submit detailed admissions data, including race and academic metrics, to the Department of Education. This action aims to enforce the 2023 Supreme Court ban on affirmative action by scrutinizing whether institutions still use racial proxies in their selection process. Critics, like the American Council on Education, label it a "fishing expedition," arguing it oversimplifies the holistic review process, while the Education Department faces resource challenges in managing the new data influx.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the South China Morning Post criticizes the United States' response to the Chinese research vessel Xue Long 2 operating in the Arctic. The author argues that the U.S. implying "malign activity" and interfering with scientific research on the high seas is inconsistent with its professed commitment to international maritime law. The article cites the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), asserting that a coastal state's rights do not permit infringement on other nations' freedoms in international waters.</p>

          <p>Dean Cain, known for playing Superman in the 1990s TV series "Lois & Clark," has announced his plan to become an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. The announcement followed an agency decision to waive age limits for new applicants as it seeks to fill 10,000 vacancies. Cain, who has previously served as a reserve police officer and sheriff's deputy, stated he will be sworn in soon, a move that comes after he recently criticized the new "Superman" film for its portrayal of the character as an immigrant.</p>

This move is seen as a way for the administration to install a dissenting voice on the board and keep options open for selecting a new Fed Chair when Jerome Powell's term expires.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers star left tackle Rashawn Slater was carted off the field during practice after suffering an apparent left leg injury. The incident occurred during a team drill when Slater collapsed after being pushed backward and immediately grabbed his leg. Slater, who recently became the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history, appeared visibly distraught as he was helped off the field. The injury raises significant concerns for the team's offensive line depth, especially with other players already sidelined.</p>

          <p>The UK-based Good Food website has sparked anger among Italians by publishing a recipe for the classic Roman dish, cacio e pepe, that included non-traditional ingredients like parmesan and butter. An Italian restaurant association expressed its "astonishment," sending letters of complaint to the site's owner and the British embassy in Rome. Italian chefs and food lovers criticized the recipe for misrepresenting the traditional dish, which consists of only three ingredients: spaghetti, pecorino cheese, and black pepper, arguing that altering it fundamentally changes its identity.</p>

          <p>A former security officer at the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic has been indicted for allegedly running a cocaine smuggling conspiracy. According to the Department of Justice, Jairo Eliezer Arias Caceres recruited couriers and arranged for them to transport cocaine into the New York area. The drugs were reportedly disguised in packages such as Marlboro cigarette cartons and Choco Pie boxes. Prosecutors stated that Caceres exploited his position and knowledge from his previous job as an airport security officer to facilitate the criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their lawsuit challenging the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives to proceed. The court determined that the Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is not above the law and its decisions can be reviewed by courts, overturning a lower court's deferential ruling. The environmental groups argue that the CPUC's 2022 decision to slash credits for solar panel owners violates state law and undermines California's clean energy goals, a case that will now return to the appeals court.</p>

While Mr. Trump cited "out of control" crime, official data shows that violent crime in the district has been declining for the past year and a half. Legal experts note that the president cannot unilaterally federalize the city; doing so would require an act of Congress to overturn the 1973 Home Rule Act, a move that is highly unlikely to pass the Senate.</p>

          <p>According to a memo reviewed by Reuters, the U.S. Air Force is denying early retirement requests from all transgender service members with 15 to 18 years of service. Instead, these individuals will be forced to separate from the military without retirement benefits, a move that rescinds some previously approved applications. This action is the latest step in the Trump administration's policy to bar transgender individuals from serving, which advocates call discriminatory and a betrayal of a commitment made to long-serving military personnel.</p>

The film serves as a pleasant reunion for fans of the 2003 movie but ultimately feels more like a vehicle for cameos and light hijinks than a story with significant emotional insight.</p>
