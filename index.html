            <p>During Xi Jinping's visit to Malaysia, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim declared Malaysia's support for China, emphasizing their national economic interests and overall stability. This alignment comes as China seeks to strengthen trade ties with Southeast Asian nations amid rising US tariff threats. The two countries are expected to finalize agreements boosting Malaysian exports like palm oil and durian, increasing Chinese tourism and student exchanges, and sharing expertise in renewable energy. Analysts suggest China expects reciprocal support from Malaysia and other Southeast Asian nations, potentially leading to tensions with the United States.</p>

            <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported lower-than-expected net bookings, citing uncertainty stemming from new U.S. trade restrictions.

ASML estimates its 2025 revenue to be between 30 billion and 35 billion euros, but the potential impact of U.S. tariffs is still unclear. The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting a national security investigation into semiconductor technology imports, potentially leading to additional trade measures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A recent study indicates a decline in the use of disposable e-cigarettes in the UK as the government prepares to implement a ban on their sale starting June 1, 2025. Researchers suggest that vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable devices in anticipation of the ban, with the percentage of 16-24 year olds primarily using disposable vapes dropping significantly. The ban aims to reduce littering and address rising rates of youth vaping. While vaping is considered a means to stop smoking, health officials caution against its use by non-smokers, especially young people, due to potential detrimental effects on concentration and brain development.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) issued a cease and desist order against Google for violating anti-monopoly laws by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize Google's own search apps and services. Google's licensing agreements with manufacturers included requirements to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome on devices. The JFTC also stated that Google required manufacturers to exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump by news agencies, including the Associated Press, following a court ruling that the administration had improperly banned the AP. The new policy limits the number of wire service reporters allowed in small-space events and gives the press secretary discretion over who can question the president. The White House Correspondents Association has criticized the policy, arguing that it allows for viewpoint discrimination. The AP has expressed disappointment with the restrictions.</p>

Water UK states companies plan to invest £12 billion to reduce spills by the end of the decade, primarily funded by increased water bills.
