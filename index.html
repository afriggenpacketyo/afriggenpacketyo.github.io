          <p>The Syrian government has postponed parliamentary elections in the provinces of Sweida, Hasaka, and Raqqa, citing the necessity of establishing a "safe environment" for voting. Sweida continues to experience simmering tensions between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin tribes, while Hasaka and parts of Raqqa remain under the control of Kurdish-led forces, highlighting unresolved conflicts with Damascus. This election is the first since Ahmed al-Sharaa's Islamist government took power, following his dissolution of the previous parliament and approval of an interim constitution. Critics express concern that this new framework consolidates excessive power in Sharaa's hands and does not adequately reflect Syria's rich ethnic and religious diversity, raising questions about the country's political future.</p>

          <p>Anti-corruption protests in Serbia have escalated, marked by daily reports of police violence and arrests, alongside accusations that the government employs criminal gangs against demonstrators. The European Union faces growing calls to adopt a firmer stance towards President Aleksandar Vucic's administration, with critics asserting that its current "appeasement strategy" is failing. This approach is seen as influenced by the EU's strategic interests, such as access to Serbia's lithium reserves and concerns over its ties with Russia, which risks compromising the union's core democratic values and public trust in its enlargement process. Experts suggest the EU could apply pressure by conditioning or delaying the substantial financial aid promised to Serbia, linking it directly to the implementation of crucial democratic and rule-of-law reforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has expanded an order, blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties, including major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and Chicago. The ruling reiterates an earlier decision that it is unconstitutional for the president to freeze funding for local governments that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The administration argues these cities obstruct federal law enforcement, while the plaintiffs contend such policies are an "abuse of power" and violate the Tenth Amendment, asserting local governments' right to choose not to assist ICE. This legal battle underscores the ongoing tension between federal and local authorities over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>FBI agents reportedly raided the Bethesda, Maryland, home and Washington D.C. office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, linking the action to an investigation into alleged mishandling of classified documents. The New York Post cited a Trump administration official claiming the probe was ordered by FBI Director Kash Patel, though a senior U.S. official suggested it was separate from a prior inquiry regarding Bolton's memoir. President Trump, who had previously revoked Bolton's security clearance, expressed strong personal disdain, calling him a "lowlife" and "not a smart guy," highlighting the deep animosity between the two. The FBI and Bolton's office have declined to comment on the matter, leaving the full details of the investigation unclear.</p>

Ash utilizes a text-telephone service for anonymous communication, avoiding direct contact with his clients, such as biotech scientist Sarah (Lily James), who is on the run with incriminating documents. The film is praised for its clever premise, which updates the 1970s paranoid thriller genre for the digital age by exploring themes of privacy, surveillance, and the cynical choice between escape or settlement with tormentors. The narrative delivers a dizzyingly enjoyable cat-and-mouse chase, while also hinting at the personal toll of Ash's isolated crusade.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is dedicated to safeguarding over 20 species at risk of extinction, including the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret, at its extensive Northern Virginia facility. Researchers at SCBI delve into species' reproduction, ecology, genetics, and conservation sustainability, successfully breeding and reintroducing animals to their natural environments. Despite these vital initiatives, conservation biologists express deep concern over the accelerating rate of species disappearance, emphasizing that the loss of even a single species can trigger detrimental cascading effects throughout an entire ecosystem. The institute's successful programs, like the growing black-footed ferret population, underscore the critical importance of these efforts in preserving biodiversity and training the next generation of conservationists.</p>

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, has made an impressive start to his tenure, securing consecutive wins and clean sheets, including a 2-0 victory over Manchester City. This early success has quickly endeared him to supporters, who had been disillusioned by the club's perceived failings in the summer transfer window and chairman Daniel Levy. Despite limited new signings and key player departures or injuries, Frank's tactical approach has brought defensive solidity while maintaining attacking freedom. His ability to revitalize players like Joao Palhinha, who delivered a standout performance against Manchester City, suggests that hiring Frank from Brentford could be the club's most impactful acquisition this summer, shifting the mood around the team.</p>

          <p>The ongoing war in Ukraine is significantly reshaping geopolitical dynamics in the former Soviet Union, notably diminishing Russia's influence. This shift is exemplified by a US-brokered peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, a role Russia traditionally held. While Moscow officially welcomed the deal, some Russian figures view it as a major humiliation, indicating a loss of control in the South Caucasus. Other former Soviet states, like Azerbaijan, are actively pursuing new alliances with countries such as Turkey and Central Asian nations, and adopting "multi-vector foreign policies." This article highlights that Russia's perceived weakness and international isolation due to sanctions have created a "window of opportunity" for these nations to assert greater independence and diversify their international relations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), arguing the funding is unconstitutional due to its race-based eligibility criteria. This decision supports a lawsuit filed by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, which contends that the program provides an unfair advantage and deprives non-HSI universities of crucial funding. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the Justice Department asserts that the program promotes "outright racial balancing." A national association of Hispanic-serving universities has moved to intervene in the lawsuit, emphasizing that these grants help level the playing field for institutions serving a large proportion of Latino students who often receive less state and federal funding.</p>

The Met Office has already indicated this summer is on track for record heat, following four previous heatwaves.

          <p>Berlin has officially renamed "Mohrenstrasse" (Moor Street) to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse, honoring the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate, following a five-year legal battle with residents. The decision, upheld by the Higher Administrative Court, marks a significant step in decolonization efforts, acknowledging the racist connotations of the previous name, which stemmed from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany. Anton Wilhelm Amo, enslaved as a boy from Ghana, became a distinguished philosopher and legal scholar whose work has been largely erased from European intellectual history. This article celebrates the renaming as a symbol of Black resistance and a demand for greater appreciation of Amo's contributions and Black history in Germany.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Shawn Kemp has been sentenced to 30 days of electronic home monitoring, one year of supervision, and 240 hours of community service for shooting at two men in a Washington state mall parking lot. Prosecutors had sought a nine-month jail term, but the judge opted for a lesser sentence after agreeing with Kemp's defense that he acted in self-defense. Kemp claimed the men had provoked the incident by stealing his truck, cellphone, and memorabilia, and that one of them fired a shot at him first. Following the hearing, Kemp expressed his intention to become an advocate against gun violence, particularly among youth, urging others to "think twice" in moments of anger.</p>

          <p>A colossal landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami, reaching an incredible 1,400 feet up the opposite side, yet miraculously caused no reported casualties due to early morning timing and poor weather. Scientists estimate up to 100 million cubic meters of rock fell, with the resulting 100-foot wave barreling down the inlet. This article highlights concerns from geologists that such events, near popular tourist areas, may be increasing due to climate change-induced glacial retreat and thawing permafrost, which "de-buttress" mountainsides. Researchers are now monitoring other unstable slopes in Alaska, aiming to improve understanding and warning signals for these "shockingly huge" natural phenomena.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the significant influx of retail investor capital into speculative exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly single-stock, leveraged, and inverse strategies, could be a critical warning sign for an overheating market. Mike Akins of ETF Action notes that product proliferation and flows into these niche strategies are approaching 2020-2021 levels, which coincided with a market peak. This article emphasizes that these highly volatile funds are predominantly owned by retail investors, with institutional participation largely limited to providing liquidity. Akins cautions that yield-focused products, like covered call ETFs, can become unsustainable if underlying stocks decline, suggesting that this retail appetite for risky funds historically acts as a contrarian signal for market exuberance.

          <p>This article addresses the common retirement dilemma faced by a 66-year-old, Alex, whose company wants him to stay on as a part-time consultant to train his replacement after he gave a year's notice. The piece explores the implications of such a decision on retirement benefits, particularly Social Security, noting that earning income while collecting benefits before full retirement age can temporarily reduce payments. It also discusses the potential to delay claiming Social Security to increase future monthly benefits and suggests that staying on longer could allow for more 401(k) contributions and continued employer-provided health insurance. The article offers practical advice for navigating this transition to optimize financial outcomes in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several major US hospital systems, including Kaiser Permanente and Children's National Hospital, are discontinuing or pausing pediatric gender-affirming care services due to "escalating legal and regulatory risks." This widespread retrenchment follows a Trump administration executive order against funding gender transition for minors and a controversial HHS review that called for greater use of psychotherapy. Advocates and experts in pediatric gender care express deep concern, arguing that these policy changes interfere with patient-doctor relationships and could severely harm the mental health and well-being of transgender youth. This article highlights the ongoing debate, with some clinicians quietly acknowledging a weak evidence base for interventions in minors, while others decry the closures as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses a previous stance that troops would not carry weapons, despite the deployment being unpopular with many residents and local officials. While the National Guard has primarily been stationed near landmarks, not directly involved in law enforcement, the move raises concerns about militarization of domestic policing. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force, has hailed the mission as bringing "total safety" and is considering expanding it to Chicago, sparking strong opposition from Mayor Brandon Johnson.</p>
