          <p>Max Verstappen secured a decisive victory at the Japanese Grand Prix, overcoming early weekend challenges and intense pressure from McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Norris initially contested Verstappen's driving, but stewards sided with the champion. Despite closely trailing Verstappen for the majority of the race, the McLarens couldn't mount a successful challenge, with Piastri even suggesting he had the pace to overtake. Verstappen attributed his success to continuous car improvements throughout the weekend, while Norris acknowledged McLaren's need for further development to compete effectively. The race saw static order among the top contenders, with Ferrari's Leclerc and Mercedes' Russell rounding out the top five.</p>

          <p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has strongly criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to Labour MPs Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, calling the action "unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning." The Israeli population and immigration authority claimed the MPs were refused entry due to their intention to "spread hate speech" against Israel. Lammy has communicated his disapproval to Israeli government counterparts, emphasizing that this treatment of British Parliamentarians is inappropriate. The Foreign Office is providing support to the affected MPs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Joel Budd's book 'Underdogs' challenges conventional understandings of the white working class, arguing that geography, rather than ethnicity, is the key factor shaping their distinct experiences. The book identifies 'heartlands,' 'enclaves,' and 'colonies' as distinct geographical contexts within which white workers live, each influencing their sense of identity and social mobility. It critiques the tendency to portray the white working class as uniformly hostile to immigration, highlighting the diversity of opinions and the role of 'ventriloquised xenophobia' in political discourse. The review also questions the Labour party's shift away from class politics, arguing that this has contributed to the alienation of working-class voters.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Britain should not be cowed by Donald Trump's trade policies but instead should combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to sustain a rules-based, open global trading and financial system. The author suggests associating Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU and extending that association to a newly relevant commonwealth. The piece also advocates for a defence levy to raise defence spending and turbocharge public investment to offset recession. It criticizes Keir Starmer for not making a clear choice between Trump's framework and creating something fresh that works for Britain and the world.</p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan ahead of a drill last week, a move analysts say was likely training to counter American warships nearby and to explore alternative routes in the event of a conflict over the island. The Shandong appears to have bypassed the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, instead transiting via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. Analysts said the new route could give the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, which is seen as a strategic chokepoint.</p>
