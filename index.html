          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues to battle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for crucial rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew Gilich states the city needs $111 million for essential sewage and stormwater system upgrades and $4 million for its pier, but FEMA has offered significantly less and denied appeals. The ongoing dispute highlights broader issues, with 254 other Katrina relief projects across Louisiana and Mississippi remaining unfinished. Gilich expresses cautious optimism that funding will eventually materialize, aiming to complete the rebuilding within three years.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether a prestigious Napa Valley winery, Hundred Acre, played a role in sparking the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire. A source suggests investigators are looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard ignited the blaze, which started on the winery's property. While the fire is 33% contained and no structures have been destroyed, the investigation continues amidst a major heatwave. Hundred Acre confirmed cooperation with authorities, denying any controlled burns, and reported only road and infrastructure damage to its properties.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is revising its "customer of size" policy, effective January 27, 2026, which will no longer guarantee a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers unless specific conditions are met, including an open seat on the flight. This change, part of a shift to assigned seating, has drawn strong criticism from advocates who fear increased financial burdens and anxiety for plus-size passengers. Many view it as a reversal of Southwest's previous stance as an inclusive airline, potentially impacting travel accessibility for a community already facing significant challenges.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new video footage indicates that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times, not twice as initially reported, during a deadly attack that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. The analysis identified two near-simultaneous strikes on staircases in the first wave, and two separate projectiles hitting the same location milliseconds apart in a later incident. Experts suggest multiple tanks may have been involved due to the rapid succession of impacts. Israel's narrative of the attack has evolved, with an initial inquiry citing a Hamas camera, while international legal experts raise concerns about potential violations of international law.</p>

          <p>Rohingya refugees and their relatives allege that Indian authorities forcibly deported 40 individuals to Myanmar, a country they had fled due to civil war and persecution. Accounts describe refugees being flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, then placed on a naval vessel, and ultimately forced into the Andaman Sea with life jackets, believing they were going to Indonesia. Some refugees reported being subjected to violence and religious questioning during their detention. The UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar states there is "significant evidence" supporting these allegations, which India has not addressed.</p>

          <p>An angler in Lake Huron discovered an enormous grass carp, one of the most invasive fish species, prompting a warning from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. This sterile female, measuring over a meter long, is the third found in Canadian waters since 2013, though 34 have been collected from the Great Lakes since 2012. Grass carp, known for consuming up to 40% of their body weight in vegetation daily, can devastate aquatic ecosystems by destroying plant life, clouding water, and risking native fish and bird species. Officials are conducting surveys and urge the public to report sightings.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) (Supervised) system is a deterrent for more US consumers than an attraction, with 35% less likely to buy a Tesla because of it, compared to 14% more likely. The report also indicates that nearly half of consumers believe FSD should be illegal. This finding comes amidst a sales slump for Tesla and reputational damage linked to Elon Musk's rhetoric. Despite Musk's emphasis on FSD for Tesla's future, the company faces a "market education problem" and declining brand reputation, with many consumers demanding stricter AV regulations.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz, citing legal requirements for an advisory panel's backing. With six of the seven panel members dismissed by President Trump and no replacements confirmed, Lake lacks the legal authority. The ruling states Lake's efforts to dismantle Voice of America, which included stripping language services and laying off staff, violate statutory requirements for the broadcaster to be a reliable news source. Lake announced an appeal, asserting presidential executive powers, while Abramowitz welcomed the ruling.</p>

Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan surged, making China Japan's top source of inbound visitors. This paradox underscores the enduring impact of historical wounds alongside deep economic interdependence and cultural affinity, shaping a relationship characterized by both remembrance and modern engagement.</p>
