          <p>Two individuals sustained critical injuries in a shooting at Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology in Inglewood, California. The incident occurred on the school campus, prompting a swift response from local firefighters and police. The victims are believed to be female employees of the college. A suspect, identified as Jesse Figueroa, a 40-year-old employee and unarmed security guard at the school, was apprehended near Berendo and Twelfth streets in Pico-Union after a 911 call from his family, who reported the shooting and the location of the firearm in his vehicle. The campus was thoroughly searched, and dozens of staff and students were seen outside during the preliminary investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signals a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, marking a significant change in the structure of Trump's administration. Klein contends that Vance's loyalty and accelerationist views, contrasting with other potential candidates, reflect Trump's preference for enforcers and loyalists over moderating forces. The article suggests that Trump's second term would be characterized by a lack of dissent and a focus on loyalty, differing significantly from his first term, which was marked by internal friction and external checks. The author posits that the choice of Vance revealed that Trump's second term would offer no concessions and contain no skeptics, with the guardrails now gone.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall's article emphasizes the importance of remembering the dead of World War II while also acknowledging the ongoing atrocities in current conflicts around the world. The article points to events in Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, and Gaza, highlighting the daily occurrences of violence and human suffering. Tisdall criticizes the silence and normalization of this carnage, attributing it to the complexity and number of conflicts, the paralysis of the UN system, and the reduction in overseas aid. The author argues that atrocities are not merely historical events but a reflection of the modern world's political, military, and moral failures.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has outlawed Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, which offered citizenship to foreign investors. The court ruled that such programs reduce nationality to a "mere commercial transaction" and undermine the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, saying it had raised millions for charitable causes, he said the government would rework the system to align with the court's decision. Although purchased passports are now prohibited, "golden visas," which offer residence permits for investments, remain a point of concern, with Transparency International advocating for increased due diligence and background checks.</p>

New taxes on essential goods and services, along with increased contributions to social programs, have led to widespread discontent.

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, posing a serious challenge to the traditional two-party system dominated by the Labour and Conservative parties. The article highlights the rising support for Reform, driven by public disenchantment with the main parties and Farage's vigorous campaigning. While the next general election is not until 2029, the fragmentation of British politics, with multiple parties vying for votes, has created deep unpredictability. The article suggests that the Conservatives face an even bigger threat from Reform, and that a shift is underway that could transform the fortunes of Reform, taking what has been a protest party and turning it into a force that could make good on its ambition to replace the Conservatives as the main opposition party.</p>

The tariff pause has provided little comfort, as the threat of reinstatement has caused some American retailers to cancel orders and factories to freeze hiring or cut jobs. While Vietnam's government is attempting to negotiate with the Trump administration, the potential for significant tariffs poses a serious threat to the country's manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private schools, while supporters claim it ensures students have the freedom to seek the educational option that is right for them.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 flights per day from Newark Liberty International Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing issues. The airline CEO stated that the airport cannot handle the number of planes scheduled to operate there in the coming weeks and months. The FAA attributed the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is located. The Transportation Secretary unveiled plans to revamp the air traffic control system, a project expected to take three to four years, leading to passenger frustration due to delays and cancellations.</p>

          <p>Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan has introduced a two-day bus tour featuring ten bronze statues of characters from the popular comic and animated series "One Piece." The statues, created by manga artist Eiichiro Oda, aim to promote tourism and support recovery efforts following the 2016 earthquakes. Scattered across nine municipalities, the tour offers a chance to remember the disaster and observe reconstruction progress. The tour is currently organized for domestic tourists, but translation services may be considered if there is significant interest from overseas visitors.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships cite the country's surname law as a reason for not marrying. This law requires couples to adopt the same surname upon marriage, leading many to avoid legal marriage. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that the rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group willing to marry if separate surnames were allowed. Common-law couples in Japan do not have access to the same benefits as legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with 12,000 new coffee shops opening in the past year, driven by aggressive expansion and price competition that makes coffee more accessible. This growth is occurring as President Xi Jinping promotes domestic beans, particularly from Yunnan province. While the market expands, Starbucks' market share in China has declined significantly, from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as new entrants with innovative business models and flavors gain traction. The growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, indicating a shift in coffee culture beyond major metropolitan areas.</p>

The town, which has a population of approximately 13,000, saw 334,000 tourists in fiscal 2023, causing congestion and strain on local infrastructure. Admission restrictions, including shuttle buses and pre-purchased tickets, were implemented from December 2024 to February 2025, resulting in improved congestion and positive feedback from visitors.
