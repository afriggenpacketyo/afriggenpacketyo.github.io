          <p>Jacob Samuel Winkler, a 33-year-old man from Washington, D.C., has been arrested and charged with a felony after allegedly shining a laser pointer at Marine One while it was carrying former President Trump. According to court documents, Winkler was observed acting erratically before aiming the laser at the helicopter, potentially endangering the aircraft and its occupants. Winkler reportedly made statements referencing apologizing to Trump after being apprehended, and admitted to aiming the laser at various objects. The U.S. Attorney for D.C. emphasized the seriousness of the offense, highlighting the risk posed to the aircraft and its passengers. The suspect's erratic behavior and the potential danger to the helicopter have raised concerns. </p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions secured a decisive 38-30 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, showcasing a dominant ground game with 225 rushing yards and a relentless defense that sacked Lamar Jackson seven times. Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery led the rushing attack, while Al-Quadin Muhammad spearheaded the defensive effort. Despite Lamar Jackson's strong passing performance, the Ravens struggled to contain the Lions' balanced offense and aggressive defense. This win propels the Lions to a 2-1 record, while the Ravens fall to 1-2 after failing to capitalize in the game's crucial moments. The Lions' ability to control the line of scrimmage and capitalize on key turnovers proved to be the difference-maker in this high-scoring affair. The team's overall performance reflects a positive trajectory for the season. </p>

          <p>Copenhagen and Oslo airports experienced temporary closures due to drone sightings, causing flight disruptions and prompting investigations by Danish and Norwegian authorities. Danish police are unsure of the origin or number of drones, and are implementing measures as part of their investigation. Ukrainian President Zelensky referenced a "Russia's violation" of Nato airspace in Copenhagen, but did not indicate a source for the information. The closures led to flight diversions and warnings of ongoing delays, highlighting the increasing concern over unauthorized drone activity near critical infrastructure. Authorities are collaborating to determine if there is a connection between the incidents. </p>

          <h2>Hurricane Gabrielle Strengthens, Forecast to Pass East of Bermuda</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 22:41:54 EDT</div>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 season. The storm's center is projected to pass east of Bermuda, with no watches or warnings currently in effect for the island. However, the National Hurricane Center advises those in the Azores to monitor Gabrielle's progress. Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach the East Coast of North America, posing a threat of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. While the Atlantic hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted, Gabrielle's strength underscores the potential for significant storms. </p>

          <p>A jury in New Zealand has convicted Hakyung Lee of murdering her two children in June 2018, whose remains were discovered in suitcases in an Auckland storage unit in August 2022. Lee, who had fled to South Korea after the killings and changed her name, was extradited to face trial, denying the charges and claiming insanity. Prosecutors argued that Lee acted with cold calculation, planning a new life without her children. The defense admitted Lee killed the children with anti-depressant medication but claimed she had descended into madness following her husband's death. Lee will remain in custody until her sentencing on November 26, where she faces a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 10 years before parole eligibility. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump has advised pregnant women to avoid Tylenol, citing a disputed link between the drug and autism, a move that has drawn criticism from medical experts. Trump stated that pregnant women should only take paracetamol, the main ingredient in Tylenol, in cases of extreme fever. The FDA will issue a physicians notice and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness about the potential risk of taking Tylenol during pregnancy. He also said the FDA will soon approve Leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used to protect cancer patients against toxicity from chemotherapy, to be used as treatment for children with autism. Medical experts have pushed back, stating that the announcement is not backed by scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the causes of neurologic challenges in children. </p>

          <p>NASA has announced its newest class of astronaut candidates, comprising four men and six women, selected from over 8,000 applicants. The candidates will begin training for potential missions to the International Space Station, the moon, and eventually Mars. The class includes pilots, engineers, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. One of the candidates, Anna Menon, previously flew to orbit on a commercial SpaceX flight. These new astronauts will join NASA's ranks during a time of budget cuts and uncertainty. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order designating Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," directing agencies to investigate and dismantle the group's operations. The move comes amid efforts to crack down on the "radical left" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, although there is no evidence linking the suspect to Antifa. Antifa, a decentralized leftist movement opposing far-right ideologies, has been a frequent target of Trump and Republicans. The designation allows the administration to potentially ban members and seize funding, raising questions about its practical implementation. </p>

This shift is driven by a coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress. Animal tests have played a role in developing vaccines and medications, but the move has sparked debate. The FDA is now among the agencies promising to make a "paradigm shift" in how new drugs are approved. </p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced that the FDA believes the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, a claim disputed by medical experts. Trump advised pregnant women to limit Tylenol use and suggested vaccines should be given in smaller doses, without citing medical evidence. The FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to minimize acetaminophen use during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers, but acknowledged the issue is an ongoing scientific debate. Medical experts and the maker of Tylenol have pushed back against the claims, emphasizing the lack of scientific evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. </p>

          <p>Autism groups have criticized the Trump administration's claims about Tylenol causing autism, calling it dangerous and regressive. Trump, alongside Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) RFK Jr. and other officials, claimed that Tylenol use during pregnancy could contribute to the development of autism in children. Experts and advocacy groups say the claim is not supported by scientific research and oversimplifies a complex developmental difference. Some groups have expressed concern about the potential for harm caused by pushing unproven treatments and placing blame on mothers. </p>

          <p>President Trump blamed acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, as a significant factor in the rise of U.S. autism diagnoses, at a news conference where he offered often inaccurate medical advice. Trump said that the mumps, measles and rubella vaccine should be broken up into multiple shots and that children defer until age 12 the hepatitis B vaccine series now started at birth. The announcement was met with dismay from autism researchers and advocates who said that research thus far into causal links between acetaminophen and autism has turned up minimal evidence. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will initiate a safety-label update for Tylenol and other acetaminophen products. </p>
