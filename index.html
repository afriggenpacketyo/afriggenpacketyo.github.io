          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and multiple injuries on a Saturday evening. The incident prompted a significant police response and a temporary shelter-in-place order for a nearby neighborhood as authorities searched for the perpetrator. Authorities have since detained a person of interest, confirming through surveillance footage that there was only one shooter involved in the attack. The police have assured the public that there is no longer an ongoing threat, although the investigation into the motive continues.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is gaining strength over the central Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will remain over open waters, passing east of Bermuda on Monday without any direct watches or warnings for land areas. However, Gabrielle is expected to generate significant ocean swells that will affect the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada early next week. The storm's formation comes after the historical peak of the hurricane season, which has been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. By analyzing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides, which they attribute to seismic activity known as moonquakes. This finding, published in the National Science Review, has significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases on the moon. The study underscores the need to assess geological hazards, as endogenic activity on the moon has not ceased as previously thought.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of five bills aimed at increasing protections for residents amid federal immigration enforcement operations. The most prominent new law, the No Secret Police Act, prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks and requires them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other bills restrict immigration agents' access to schools and health facilities without a judicial warrant. These measures are framed by state officials as a form of resistance against what they term the Trump administration's "authoritarian tendencies" and efforts to protect vulnerable communities.</p>

The body of Celeste Rivas, who was reported missing last year, was discovered in the trunk of a Tesla that had been impounded after being abandoned on a Hollywood Hills street. While no suspect has been named and police have not yet indicated a crime occurred, the 20-year-old artist is reportedly cooperating with the investigation.

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide and one of his former defense attorneys, to be the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment follows the abrupt resignation of the previous prosecutor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly faced pressure to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Halligan's nomination places a loyalist with no prosecutorial experience in charge of a key office that has been investigating the president's political adversaries. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Virginia's Democratic senators, who raised concerns about political interference.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated his administration is in discussions to regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, a strategic asset the U.S. vacated years ago. Trump highlighted the base's proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites as a key reason for wanting to re-establish a presence there. The announcement has drawn swift pushback from both the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan and China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson emphasized respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty and warned against actions that could stir up regional tension, signaling a potential new point of friction in U.S.-China relations.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two of his U.S. shows after receiving what was described as a credible death threat prior to a concert in Ottawa, Canada. A 26-year-old man was arrested and released on bail for allegedly threatening to kill the artist. While the Ottawa performance proceeded as planned, subsequent shows in Massachusetts and Connecticut were called off out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the artist and his band.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point has paradoxically resulted in an increase in long-term rates, including those for mortgages. While the stock market reacted positively, bond traders sold off long-term bonds, driving their yields higher. Analysts suggest this reaction reflects concerns that the Fed may be easing its monetary policy too soon, potentially ignoring inflation risks while the economy remains relatively stable. This market behavior indicates skepticism about the central bank's strategy and its potential impact on future inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite general consumer caution and economic headwinds, sales of used electric vehicles in the U.S. have surged, with a 40% spike recorded for the month of July. A key driver of this trend is the discovery by buyers that pre-owned EVs are often priced lower than comparable gasoline-powered cars, even before factoring in savings on fuel and maintenance. This boom in the used market is occurring as the overall EV market share grows, reaching nearly 10% of all cars sold in August. The trend suggests that affordability is a major factor in accelerating the consumer transition to electric vehicles.</p>

The suspect, Anibal Hernandezsantana, was charged with multiple felonies after at least three bullets were fired into the station's lobby while the building was occupied; no injuries were reported. The incident occurred one day after a protest was held outside the station regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Authorities have not yet confirmed a motive or any connection between the shooting and the protest as the investigation continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While deadly flooding in the Southwest has subsided, forecasters warn that monsoonal moisture will bring a renewed risk of flash floods to parts of California and Arizona on Sunday and Monday. The threat will then shift eastward across the Central U.S. early next week. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season. While Gabrielle is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast as it passes east of Bermuda.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics will eliminate all jobs by around 2030, leading to a future of "sustainable abundance." He suggests that instead of a universal basic income, society will implement a "universal high income," where everyone's needs, including top-tier healthcare, housing, and food, are met. This optimistic vision contrasts with widespread anxiety about job displacement due to automation. However, critics question the feasibility of such a system, citing current government debt and the immense political and economic challenges of funding it.</p>

          <p>A new stage adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" transposes the story to the 21st century, swapping Regency-era society balls for modern Essex nightclubs and matchmaking for meddling in friends' dating app profiles. Written by Ava Pickett, the play portrays Emma as a clever but haughty university student who has returned home after failing her exams. The adaptation explores contemporary themes of social status, friendship, and romance through the lens of technology and working-class life. It aims to capture the timeless human conditions of jealousy and love that made the original 1815 novel a masterpiece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are working long hours in part-time jobs because their government maintenance loans are insufficient to cover basic living expenses like rent and bills. Recent studies show that the maximum loan covers just half the costs for a minimum standard of living, forcing students to juggle employment with their studies. Some students report working up to 30 hours a week or commuting for hours from their family homes to save money. This financial pressure is impacting their ability to participate in university life and focus on their education.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing athletic performance and muscle growth, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating brain fog. The naturally occurring compound helps cells produce energy, which is crucial for high-intensity physical activity and brain function. While research has extensively documented its effects on muscles, a growing but still limited body of evidence suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. Experts note that more studies are needed, particularly regarding its effects on women and conditions like perimenopausal brain fog, before definitive conclusions can be drawn.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's decision under Prime Minister Keir Starmer to recognize a Palestinian state marks a significant shift in British foreign policy, driven by a combination of domestic and international pressures. The move came after mounting calls from within the Labour Party, particularly from MPs in constituencies with large Muslim populations angered by the situation in Gaza. While the government frames it as a step toward a two-state solution, critics argue it is a symbolic gesture that rewards terrorism without addressing key issues like the release of hostages. The decision also places the UK at odds with the U.S. administration's position.</p>

          <p>A memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed two weeks ago, is expected to draw major political figures, including President Donald Trump, to a stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The event, organized by Turning Point USA, is being held under heightened security and has become a significant moment in the national conversation about political violence. The Trump administration has used Kirk's death to advocate for a crackdown on the "radical left," a response that has fueled accusations of government overreach. The service highlights the deep political divisions surrounding Kirk's legacy and the circumstances of his death.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to sign an agreement not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their credentials and access to the building. The updated rules also limit the movement of reporters within the facility, which houses the newly renamed Department of War. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated that the press no longer has free rein in a secure facility and must follow the rules. This move, which follows a series of recent leaks, is seen as an effort by the administration to tighten control over information released from the department.</p>

The proposed legislation is part of a broader conservative effort to memorialize the assassinated activist by comparing him to figures like Martin Luther King Jr., a comparison that King's own children have publicly rejected.

          <p>According to sources, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard did not notify the White House before revoking the security clearances of 37 individuals last month, a list that included senior CIA officials and congressional staffers. The move reportedly caused frustration within the administration, as it prevented a thorough vetting of the list and appeared to lack a direct paper trail from the president. While an intelligence official disputed this account, stating Gabbard was executing the president's agenda, the episode has deepened tensions between Gabbard's office and the CIA, and frustrated some of President Trump's top advisers.</p>
