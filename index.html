          <p>A REACH medical helicopter crashed on eastbound Highway 50 in Sacramento, California, critically injuring its three crew members: a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic. No vehicles on the freeway were involved in the incident, which occurred shortly after 7 p.m. Two crew members were found in the roadway, while a fire captain and bystanders lifted the aircraft off a trapped crew member. The accident has led to full closures on eastbound Highway 50 and connecting routes, with the cause currently under investigation by officials.</p>

Prominently featured are the planned pro-Palestine rallies at UK universities on the two-year anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack, which proceeded despite calls from the Prime Minister and Home Secretary for postponement. Other topics include an interview with a hostage's brother, the collapse of a Chinese spying case, nurses' concerns over new foreign staff rules potentially causing an NHS crisis, and observations on empty seats at the Conservative Party conference.

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence led his team to a thrilling 31-28 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs with a one-yard touchdown run in the final seconds. Lawrence, who tripped before scrambling into the end zone, sealed the win with 23 seconds remaining, ending the Jaguars' eight-game losing streak against the Chiefs dating back to 2009. The game saw multiple lead changes, including a 99-yard interception return for a touchdown by Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd. This hard-fought win improves the Jaguars' record to 4-1.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called on students to refrain from joining pro-Palestinian protests scheduled for the two-year anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. He warned of 'rising antisemitism on our streets' and described holding protests on this date as 'un-British,' asserting that some have used the anniversary as an excuse to attack British Jews. This plea comes amid heightened security for Jewish communities following a recent synagogue attack in Manchester and planned demonstrations at universities across the UK. Starmer emphasized the country's unity against those harming Jewish communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois and the City of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, arguing it is an 'unconstitutional invasion' and an abuse of power. A judge declined to issue an immediate restraining order, but troops from Texas are reportedly already en route. Governor JB Pritzker accused the administration of staging 'military-style enforcement actions' and using Black Hawk helicopters in immigration raids to sow chaos and justify military deployment. The lawsuit cites constitutional concerns regarding military involvement in civilian law enforcement and states' rights.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off southwest Mexico and is forecast to become a Category 2 hurricane, potentially approaching major hurricane status in the coming days. The Mexican government has issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Sur. Although the storm is expected to remain several hundred miles from the coast, heavy rains of 2-4 inches, gusty winds, and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are anticipated in parts of southwestern Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula. Priscilla is currently moving northwest at 9 mph with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.</p>

          <p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 have fallen to approximately 238,000 apprehensions, marking the lowest annual level since 1970. This significant decrease is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, including sealing the border, closing asylum systems, and increasing deportations. The numbers represent a dramatic shift from the record-high levels seen under the Biden administration. While praised by the White House as a success in securing the border, these policies have drawn criticism from civil liberties groups for being inhumane and unconstitutional, leading to protests and legal challenges.</p>

This growth coincides with record-high EV sales in the UK, a market attractive to BYD due to the absence of tariffs imposed on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and US.

          <p>Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick has defended his controversial remarks from March, in which he described Handsworth, Birmingham, as 'one of the worst-integrated places' he had ever visited. A leaked recording revealed Jenrick stating he saw 'not another white face' during his time there, comments that Labour MP Anna Turley criticized for reducing 'people to the colour of their skin.' Jenrick maintains his stance, citing government reports on 'parallel communities' and asserting the need for honest conversation about integration. Former Conservative Mayor Andy Street, however, strongly disagreed, calling Handsworth a 'very integrated place' and rejecting Jenrick's 'slum' characterization.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of the fatal stabbing of four Idaho University students, is reportedly finding prison life monotonous, with his routine punctuated by frequent complaints about his treatment. Currently serving a life sentence at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution, Kohberger has filed 'Resident Concern Forms' regarding delayed access to the JPay system for commissary orders and unreceived supply bags. While a judge recently blocked the release of graphic crime scene photos, other documents related to his case have been made public.

          <p>The FBI analyzed the phone records of more than a half-dozen Republican lawmakers in 2023 as part of its investigation into efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results. The scrutinized records, authorized by a grand jury, provided basic call information during the week of January 6, 2021. Nine lawmakers, including Senators Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley, were listed in a document detailing this 'preliminary toll analysis.' Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley, expressed 'grave concerns' about this 'outrageous abuse of power' and called for accountability within the FBI.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is openly considering using the Insurrection Act to deploy more troops into Democrat-led cities, as his attempts to mobilize the military face legal challenges. This contemplation follows a federal judge in Oregon temporarily halting a National Guard deployment in Portland. Trump stated he would enact the Insurrection Act 'if people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.' The ongoing legal battles highlight a significant constitutional debate over the use of federal military forces in domestic affairs, particularly over the objections of state and local leaders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion for U.S. farmers, particularly soybean producers severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. Discussions involving the Treasury and Agriculture Departments are in early stages, with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett promising 'big measures' soon. Hassett acknowledged full silos and soybeans sitting under tarps, emphasizing the president's commitment to supporting farmers. The administration suggested that tariff revenue could fund this aid, with President Trump stating, 'We're going to make sure that our farmers are in great shape.' (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal to become the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, marking a historic milestone. Strong growth in solar and wind power met 100% of the increased global electricity demand, contributing to a slight reduction in fossil fuel use. While developing countries, especially China, led this clean energy charge, some richer nations like the US and EU saw increased reliance on fossil fuels. Despite regional variations, this shift is hailed as a 'crucial turning point' by the global energy think tank Ember, driven largely by dramatic cost reductions in solar technology.</p>

Despite government reforms aimed at shifting from welfare to work, new data shows a decline in the monthly rate of job seekers finding employment, falling to 7.6% in the year to April 2025. Work coaches, whose numbers have decreased since 2021, cite short appointment times and a lack of workplace support as major obstacles.

The legislation includes strict fines, starting at 250,000 Nigerian naira ($168), with potential increases and imprisonment for repeat offenders. Enforcement will involve security agencies, local governments, and community forest monitors. A Chainsaw Usage Permit Framework is also being introduced, requiring commercial operators to obtain annual licenses after inspections and commit to replacing each removed tree with two to three new saplings as part of reforestation efforts.</p>

Only individuals aged 75 and older or those with weakened immune systems are now eligible, leading to many patients being turned away after booking appointments. Community Pharmacy England reports that between a third and a half of patients at many sites are ineligible, causing upset and instances of abuse towards staff. NHS England has since updated its website wording to clarify the criteria, urging patients to double-check their eligibility before booking.</p>

          <p>New research suggests a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant from fossil fuel mining and combustion, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, prompted by a higher incidence of ALS patients in New Brunswick, Canada, compared 304 diagnosed individuals to 1,207 healthy controls. Researchers found subjects had a 23% higher chance of an ALS diagnosis with increased SO2 exposure, even within Canada's clean air guidelines. While the study indicates association, not causation, it highlights the potential health impacts of air pollution and the need for further research and prevention strategies.</p>

The article stresses the importance of using PayPal's 'goods and services' option for payments to ensure buyer protection, as scammers often request the 'friends and family' option which offers no refunds.</p>
