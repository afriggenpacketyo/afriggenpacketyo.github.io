          <p>Multiple major European postal services, including those in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, have suspended merchandise shipments to the United States. The halt is a direct response to new U.S. import duties signed by President Trump, which will apply a 15% tariff to many goods previously exempt. Postal operators cite a lack of clarity on the new rules and insufficient time to update their computer systems before the August 29th deadline. This disruption highlights the logistical challenges and escalating trade friction caused by the new U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, a Northampton woman recently released from prison, has claimed she was made a "political prisoner" by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Connolly was sentenced to 31 months for inciting racial hatred after posting on social media that people should "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. In her first interviews since her release, she criticized Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, for his stance on free speech while maintaining her post was not her "finest moment." The Crown Prosecution Service notes that inciting racial hatred is a criminal offense not protected by freedom of expression laws.</p>

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Saturday from Israeli strikes, including individuals sheltering in tents and seeking aid. The deaths occurred as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global authority, officially declared that famine is gripping Gaza City. This rare pronouncement has intensified international pressure on Israel to halt its offensive, which was initiated after the Hamas attacks of October 2023. Israel has denounced the famine report as a lie while continuing preparations for a large-scale operation in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>An anti-ICE protest in San Francisco turned violent when a mob of up to 20 people reportedly assaulted four federal agents outside an immigration courthouse. According to the Department of Homeland Security, one protester, Adrian Guerrero, threatened to stab an officer and harm his family while also slashing the tire of a government vehicle. Guerrero was arrested and found in possession of a knife, with officials charging him with assault on a federal officer and destruction of government property. The incident is part of what DHS describes as a significant increase in assaults on its agents nationwide.</p>

          <p>A tour bus carrying 54 people crashed and rolled over on the New York State Thruway near Pembroke, resulting in five fatalities and numerous injuries. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls when the driver lost control for reasons that remain under investigation. State police have ruled out mechanical failure and operator impairment, noting the driver has been cooperative and no charges have been filed. Multiple hospitals in the region treated dozens of patients with injuries ranging from minor to critical condition.</p>

          <p>A new Czech documentary, "The Great Patriotic Trip," follows three Czech citizens with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian views as they travel to war-torn areas of Ukraine. Director Robin Kvapil filmed their reactions to seeing firsthand the destruction in cities like Kharkiv and the empty graves in Izium, sites of alleged Russian war crimes. Despite witnessing the devastation, the participants largely dismissed what they saw as Ukrainian propaganda, maintaining their original beliefs. The film has sparked intense debate in the Czech Republic about the power of disinformation and the deep divisions within society.</p>

After traditional therapy yielded minimal results, Fello received the FDA-approved implant, which uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself. Developed by MicroTransponder Inc., the technology has helped Fello regain substantial function and reduce pain in his arm. Neurosurgeons believe this first-of-its-kind technology could redefine recovery possibilities for many of the 800,000 Americans who suffer ischemic strokes annually.</p>

          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down to younger generations, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize family conflict and tax burdens. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death to take advantage of a "step-up in basis," which reduces capital gains taxes for heirs. Using legal structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can also protect the property from lawsuits and creditors. A well-drafted operating agreement for the LLC can outline rules for usage, expenses, and potential buyouts, preventing common disputes among siblings over inherited homes.</p>

The contamination stems from Pfas-laden firefighting foam used by the military, which has polluted local drinking water, including at least 100 private wells. Blood levels in the affected population were approximately 10 times higher than in those outside the contaminated zone, raising significant health concerns linked to cancer and other serious illnesses.

The author argues this approach is a nostalgic and ineffective throwback to the 2017 "resistance" era, when many believed Trump could be defeated through satire and ridicule. While acknowledging Newsom's substantive policy responses to Republican actions, the article contends that parodying Trump only reinforces his dominance of the political discourse. The author suggests that for Democrats to be successful, they must develop a coherent and relatable identity separate from simply reacting to their opponent.</p>

The change in attire was noted positively by both President Trump and the press, potentially contributing to a more successful meeting.

          <p>In this interview, astrophysicist and author Adam Becker challenges the visions of tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, arguing that colonizing Mars is a dangerous delusion. Becker describes Mars as a terrible place with an unbreathable atmosphere, lethal radiation, and poisoned soil, stating that even a cataclysmic event on Earth would not make it a worse place to live. He contends that focusing on Mars as a backup plan distracts from the urgent need to solve problems on our own planet. While supporting robotic space exploration, he views the push for colonization as a misguided fantasy.</p>

          <p>Kim Kenneth Wilson, a former elementary school teacher in Sacramento, has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting numerous students. Prosecutors revealed that Wilson used his position as head of the campus broadcast club to lure children into a windowless, soundproof room where he committed and filmed the crimes over several years. The case has also prompted civil lawsuits against the Twin Rivers Unified School District, alleging it failed to supervise Wilson and protect the students from his continued misconduct.</p>

Both Kalluk and Nicky were euthanized due to deteriorating health related to their advanced age.

          <p>Dermatologists are increasingly recommending tinted sunscreens for their ability to protect against visible light, a benefit not offered by most standard sunscreens. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key protective ingredient is iron oxide, which gives tinted products their color and is effective at blocking this type of radiation. While the focus of sun protection has traditionally been on preventing skin cancer from UV rays, experts emphasize the importance of addressing these other conditions and the psychosocial impact they can have.</p>

          <p>Thousands of unemployed South Africans, known as zama zamas, are forced into the dangerous world of illegal coal mining in abandoned pits, facing risks like toxic gas, tunnel collapses, and police crackdowns. These artisanal miners provide an essential fuel source for local communities but are viewed as criminals by the government. Despite a century of industrial mining that has polluted the land, local populations remain impoverished, creating the conditions for this illicit economy. A new draft bill aimed at formalizing artisanal mining is criticized for being too narrow and introducing harsh penalties that could criminalize entire communities.</p>

Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma is being forced to the surface through a consistent pathway, creating repeated displays of molten rock.

She also dismissed the existence of a high-profile "client list" as a conspiracy theory and claimed it was Sarah Ferguson, not herself, who introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein.

          <p>Utility bills are rising across the U.S., with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year.

This increased demand, coupled with a backlog in connecting new renewable energy sources to the grid, is straining supply.

Amo himself was enslaved as a boy in Ghana before being brought to Germany, where he became a respected philosopher.

The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have revived their anti-Trump commentary with gratifyingly mean and effective caricatures of figures like Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem. The author suggests that the show's success lies in its unapologetic and specific spite, avoiding the self-righteous tone of other topical comedies.
