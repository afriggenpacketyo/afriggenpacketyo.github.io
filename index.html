          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial government panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This decision follows Kennedy's removal of all seventeen previous members just days prior. The new appointees include individuals known for their skepticism towards vaccines, such as Dr. Robert Malone and Vicky Pebsworth, raising concerns among public health experts about the future direction of vaccine policy and availability in the United States. Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel, criticized the selections, suggesting the public will receive lower quality advice compared to the previous committee. Optimism is tempered by concerns over potential shifts in vaccine policy and the qualifications of the new appointees.</p>

          <p>A leisure center in Larne, Northern Ireland, was attacked amidst a third consecutive night of violence, following unrest in Ballymena. The disorder began after a peaceful protest related to an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, escalating into what authorities describe as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers." Police have deployed dogs and water cannons, and additional officers have been sent from Police Scotland to assist. Homes displaying stickers outlining residents' nationalities have appeared, and families are fleeing the area due to the violence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, prevents the government from deporting or detaining Khalil, a green card holder, for foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. Farbiarz stated that deporting Khalil for his views would likely be unconstitutional and that Khalil's career and reputation were being irreparably harmed. The injunction provides the government an opportunity to appeal before going into effect.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to repeal Biden-era policies designed to limit air and climate pollution from power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it would begin the process of repealing regulations on carbon emissions from coal and natural-gas power plants, as well as rules on mercury and other toxins. Environmental groups are expected to sue to block the changes, arguing they violate environmental laws and disregard scientific evidence. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to boost the fossil fuel industry, despite warnings from scientists about the accelerating impact of climate change.</p>

His plea comes as over 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines are stationed in Los Angeles in response to President Trump's claim that the city would be "burning to the ground" without their presence.

          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration that the trade war with China is "done," logistics firms and retailers assert that the damage to the supply chain and the U.S. economy will remain. Even with tariffs locked in at 55%, concerns persist about the impact on companies and consumers. Industry executives highlight the potential risks to jobs and the challenges for firms to absorb the tariffs or raise prices. Uncertainty about tariff policies and potential economic slowdowns continue to weigh on trade and business decisions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>TikTok star Khaby Lame, known for his silent videos and massive online following, has left the US after being detained by immigration officials for overstaying his visa. Lame voluntarily departed to avoid a deportation order on his record, which could have prevented him from re-entering the US for up to a decade. His deportation is part of President Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen an increase in deportations. As an Italian citizen, Lame is typically allowed to travel to the US for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa.</p>

The shift has created uncertainty at universities, which rely on tuition fees from international students and value their contributions to campus diversity.

Environmental groups have criticized the proposal, arguing that it is detrimental to public health and the environment.
