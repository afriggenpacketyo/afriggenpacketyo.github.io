          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced its decision to revert to its iconic "Old Timer" logo, scrapping a controversial redesign that sparked widespread customer outrage and criticism from former President Donald Trump. The company emphasized its commitment to traditional country hospitality, stating it listened intently to public feedback regarding the rebranding. This reversal followed a period of intense scrutiny, including a stock dip after the new logo's unveiling and strong condemnation from conservative figures like Donald Trump Jr. The company's stock subsequently rose in after-hours trading, with Trump suggesting the situation could be leveraged for positive publicity if managed strategically.</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday achieved a surprising Carabao Cup victory against Premier League opponents Leeds, winning 3-0 on penalties after a 1-1 draw, amidst ongoing fan protests against owner Dejphon Chansiri. Manager Henrik Pedersen lauded his young, inexperienced squad's "togetherness" and pride, as the club faces financial turmoil and EFL sanctions. Many supporters opted to boycott the game in protest, yet the team's gutsy performance was seen as a powerful display of unity between players and the wider fanbase. This unexpected success provides a much-needed morale boost during a challenging period for the club.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that crime would be a major focus in the 2026 midterm elections, controversially claiming Republicans oppose crime while Democrats favor it. These statements were made during a Cabinet meeting, where he also discussed his ongoing "federalization" of Washington, D.C., involving the deployment of National Guard troops and a temporary takeover of the city's police force. Trump lauded the perceived success of this 12-day operation, suggesting that Democrat-led cities, like Chicago, should seek his assistance for similar interventions. He further broadened his critique to include issues such as border security and transgender rights, intensifying political divides.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled another $175 million in funding for California’s high-speed rail project, further jeopardizing the state's ambitious but long-delayed initiative. This follows a previous withdrawal of $4 billion in federal grants earlier this summer, prompting California to file a lawsuit challenging the decision as illegal. The project, initially envisioned to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco by 2020 at a cost of $33 billion, now faces projected costs of up to $128 billion with service not expected until 2033. This move intensifies the ongoing clashes between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom over various policy issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the first human case of New World screwworm in the U.S., found in a Maryland resident who recently traveled to El Salvador. This parasitic fly feeds on live tissue, causing myiasis, and is typically found in Central and South America. Symptoms include painful, unhealing skin lesions and the presence of maggots, requiring medical removal, potentially surgery. While the U.S. eradicated screwworm in 1966 and the current risk is low, efforts like breeding sterile male flies are underway to prevent a widespread problem, as the parasite poses a threat to livestock and the food supply.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported and recently rearrested, have filed an emergency motion to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the U.S. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was deported to El Salvador despite a prior court order, based on unproven claims of MS-13 gang affiliation. He was brought back to face human smuggling charges, released, then re-arrested for potential deportation to Uganda after rejecting a plea deal. His legal team argues he is now eligible for asylum and should be allowed to designate Costa Rica as his country of removal, where he has been offered refugee status.</p>

Texas Republicans passed the map, anticipating an increase of five Republican seats in Congress, which has spurred immediate legal action from multiple civil rights groups.

While some items were donated to local partners, many have expired or been destroyed, such as hundreds of tons of food and millions of contraceptives.

          <p>D Guerra Construction LLC, a Texas company, pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily injury in connection with the 2021 trench collapse death of Juan José Galvan Batalla, 24. Galvan Batalla died after a 13-foot-deep trench, which had partially collapsed earlier, caved in while he and another worker were installing a water line. This marks the first time a corporation has pleaded guilty over a worker's death in Travis County since the early 90s. The plea deal mandates new safety trainings, processes, and the hiring of safety employees, aiming to change the workplace culture and prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota woman has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct for using a racial slur against an 8-year-old Black child at a playground. The incident, captured in a viral video, showed the woman admitting to using the slur and doubling down on the racist term. Despite the charges, her fundraising campaign on GiveSendGo, where she claimed to be a victim of "silly misinformation," has surprisingly surpassed $800,000. The child's family, supported by the NAACP, is pursuing legal action, while the city attorney emphasized the lasting negative impact of the incident on communities of color.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, citing unsubstantiated mortgage fraud allegations, has ignited a significant legal and political battle with profound implications for the Fed's independence. Cook, who denies wrongdoing, plans to sue, challenging the "for cause" standard for removal, a vague legal area never before litigated at the Supreme Court. If Trump succeeds, he could gain a majority on the Fed's Board of Governors and potentially influence the reappointment of regional Fed presidents, effectively controlling interest rate policy. Historical precedents, such as Nixon's interference and Turkey's economic crisis, warn of the severe economic consequences of politicizing the central bank.</p>

The Office of the Special Counsel initiated the probe into potential Hatch Act violations, spurred by claims from GOP Senator Tom Cotton that Smith rushed Trump's trial before the 2024 election. Smith's attorneys assert that his prosecutorial decisions were based solely on evidence and followed Department of Justice guidelines, arguing that the notion of justice yielding to politics is antithetical to the rule of law.

The Federal Reserve itself affirmed that governors serve long, fixed terms and can only be removed "for cause" to safeguard monetary policy independence.
