          <p>North Korea recently held a groundbreaking ceremony in Pyongyang for a memorial dedicated to its soldiers who died fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Leader Kim Jong Un underscored the "historic peak" in bilateral relations, reaffirming North Korea's unwavering support for Moscow and their mutual defense pact, ratified in November 2024, which mandates immediate military aid in case of aggression. South Korean intelligence estimates at least 2,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed in Russia's Kursk region, with Ukraine suggesting over 14,000 troops deployed.

This decision, based on Canada's "egregious behavior," impacts ongoing trade discussions, despite existing USMCA exemptions for some Canadian goods.

          <p>A federal investigation has exposed sophisticated illegal gambling operations, leading to charges against NBA figures and alleged mafia members. One major scheme involved elaborately rigged high-stakes poker games, where suspects used advanced technologies like X-ray tables, hidden cameras, pre-marked cards, and special contact lenses to defraud victims of over $7 million. Organized crime figures from "La Cosa Nostra" allegedly ran these games, luring "fish" with the presence of "face cards" such as Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and former player Damon Jones. The NBA has placed both Billups and Miami Heat star Terry Rozier on immediate leave, with Rozier separately charged in a sports betting case involving insider information. This article details the intricate methods used to manipulate outcomes and the extensive network of individuals involved.</p>

          <p>Mark Killick, a prolific "cowboy builder" with a criminal record dating back to 1995, repeatedly defrauded 37 victims of over £1.25 million, despite legally changing his name twice. His modus operandi involved accepting large upfront payments for building work he never intended to complete, often after customers were swayed by fake online reviews and slick websites. This article highlights the systemic failures that allowed Killick to continue his cons after prison, prompting fresh calls for tighter regulations in the building trade and a central register for convicted fraudsters. Experts argue the current system inadequately protects vulnerable homeowners from such deceptive practices, leading to significant financial losses and a lack of public confidence.</p>
