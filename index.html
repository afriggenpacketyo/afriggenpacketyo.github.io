          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, fueled by concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. The decision by OPEC+ to increase production and Saudi Aramco's price cuts have further pressured oil prices. Market anxieties are mounting that tariffs will lead to higher business costs, economic slowdown, and decreased demand for oil. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Amy Griffin's memoir, "The Tell," has ignited a debate about repressed memories and the controversial use of psychedelic MDMA therapy. The book recounts Griffin's experience of recovering memories of childhood sexual abuse through therapy, which is at odds with the scientific consensus that repressed memories are not possible. While the book has garnered praise and attention, it also raises concerns about the reliance on potentially unreliable memories and the use of unapproved therapies. The article explores the science behind memory and the ethical considerations of therapy that relies on recovered memories.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry, which is facing new trade tariffs from the US. While the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales remains, manufacturers will have greater flexibility in meeting annual targets and face reduced fines. This decision comes as US President Trump has imposed a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, impacting the UK's motor industry. Opposition parties argue that Labour's measures are insufficient to boost the car industry.</p>

Examples include a new law in Utah prohibiting collective bargaining by public sector workers and a Michigan company refusing to move forward with a union election.

          <p>Digital philosopher Jaron Lanier argues that the common framing of AI as a new form of intelligence or even a god-like entity is misleading and harmful. He proposes that AI should be viewed as a collaborative tool between people, emphasizing that treating AI as an independent entity hinders its development and usefulness. Lanier criticizes the deliberate obscuring of human data sources in AI models and expresses concern about the potential for AI to accelerate the trend of virtual self-performance and social media-driven divisiveness. He advocates for a new business model for the internet that incentivizes data contribution and values human collaborators.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that AI bots, with appropriate training, can deliver mental health therapy as effectively as human clinicians. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine details the first randomized clinical trial for AI therapy. Researchers at Dartmouth College developed an AI bot to address the shortage of mental health providers in the U.S. The study found that patients working with AI therapy bots showed significant improvement, developing strong relationships and trust with their AI therapists.</p>

          <p>Harry Brook has been named England's white-ball captain, leading both the 50-over and T20 teams. This marks Brook's first full-time captaincy role with England, though he previously led the ODI side in a series against Australia. The appointment overlooks concerns about Brook's workload, as he is a key player across all formats of the game. His first series as captain will be against the West Indies, followed by the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs: How They Work and Why They Matter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on goods imported from the rest of the world, claiming they will boost the US economy and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of the product's value. Economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs. The move has led to big falls on global stock markets and raised concerns about a potential trade war.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's X is implementing stricter rules around parody accounts to reduce confusion and impersonation. Starting April 10, accounts that impersonate another user must use keywords such as "fake" or "parody" at the start of their account names. The platform will also require parody account holders to use different images from the X accounts they seek to represent. These changes aim to help users better understand the unaffiliated nature of parody accounts.</p>

The earthquake, which struck on March 28, has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries. Many locals depended on the temple for their income, selling flowers, souvenirs, and providing tours to visitors. The situation in Myanmar has been further complicated by the military's struggles to govern since overthrowing the government in 2021.</p>
