          <p>Minnesota Republican lawmakers plan to introduce a bill that would add "Trump derangement syndrome" to the state's definition of mental illness.  The proposed definition describes it as an acute onset of paranoia in response to Donald Trump's policies and presidency.  Given the state legislature's composition, the bill's passage is unlikely.</p>
