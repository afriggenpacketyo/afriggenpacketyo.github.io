          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in tariffs. This move suspends a planned increase of US tariffs to 145% on Chinese goods and China's retaliatory 125% duties on American products. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing the substantial US trade deficit with China and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices." Discussions will also cover issues like technology export controls and market access, as both nations seek to de-escalate tensions that have already impacted global trade flows.

          <p>The South Carolina Attorney General's Office has formally opposed Alex Murdaugh's appeal for a new trial in the murders of his wife and son. Prosecutors argue in a 182-page brief that the jury's guilty verdict was based on "overwhelming" evidence, not on alleged jury tampering by the Colleton County Clerk of Court, Becky Hill. Murdaugh's defense claims Hill improperly influenced jurors to secure a conviction, potentially to boost sales for her book. The state contends Hill's comments were minor and did not compromise the trial's fairness, setting the stage for oral arguments before the state Supreme Court.</p>

Domestically, a variant known as the GJ-2 forms the backbone of the People's Liberation Army's uncrewed capabilities, conducting patrols and exercises. Its widespread adoption highlights China's growing influence and success in the global military drone export market.</p>

          <p>The family of Kevin Mares, a 25-year-old from New York City, is appealing for information after he was killed in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares, who was visiting the island for a Bad Bunny concert, was an innocent bystander shot during an argument outside a nightclub. According to police, Mares was not involved in the altercation that led to the shooting, which also left two other people hospitalized. His family described him as a dedicated veterinary student with many dreams, and they are now pleading for witnesses to come forward to help bring the perpetrator to justice.</p>

          <p>The working-class community of Huntington Park, California, is experiencing a severe economic downturn as residents live in fear of increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The city, which is over 95% Latino, has seen its once-bustling commercial streets become eerily quiet, with some businesses locking their doors during operating hours for protection. Local officials report that the fear of deportation is keeping people at home, hurting local businesses and reducing the city's sales tax revenue. The situation highlights the profound impact of federal immigration policy on the daily life and economic stability of local communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the president's controversial firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed slower-than-expected hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data accuracy in the past.

          <p>This article fact-checks President Trump's justification for federalizing the D.C. police, finding his portrayal of a lawless city is based on false and misleading claims. While Trump cited 2023 crime rates, official data for 2024 and 2025 shows that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, with significant drops in homicides, robberies, and carjackings. The article points out that this narrative mirrors a similar strategy used to justify deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles. Experts quoted in the article assert that the president's claims are hyperbolic and ignore the recent, dramatic improvements in public safety in the capital.</p>

          <p>Employees at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse. In a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission, staff raised concerns about a "toxic internal culture" and the potential withdrawal of government funding by Technology Secretary Peter Kyle. The complaint follows Kyle's demand that the institute pivot its focus to defense and national security research, a significant shift from its original mission. This internal turmoil and threat to its £100m grant place the future of the prominent AI research charity in serious jeopardy.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter has revealed she felt a "sigh of relief" when her white teammates also missed penalties in a crucial Euro 2025 shootout. She feared her Black teammate, Lauren James, would have faced "astronomical" racist abuse if she had been the only one to miss. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke about the profound psychological impact of the abuse, stating it made her feel small, invaluable, and even scared to play in the final. Her comments highlight the intense pressure and racist scrutiny that Black athletes continue to face in high-stakes sporting events.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old case of missing Scottish cyclist Tony Parsons has been solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend. After Alexander McKellar confessed to his new partner, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run, he showed her where he had buried the body. Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can to mark the remote location and later informed the police, leading to the recovery of Parsons' remains.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is framing his upcoming bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin as a low-stakes "feel out" meeting, explicitly ruling out the inclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This approach positions Trump as a pragmatic mediator focused on a potential "land swapping" deal to end the war, but it also isolates Ukraine from direct negotiations about its own fate. An analyst for Sky News notes that Trump's rhetoric, including a gaffe where he conflated traveling to Alaska with going to Russia, reveals how central Putin is to his foreign policy narrative. The exclusion of Zelenskyy makes any meaningful peace deal emerging from the summit highly unlikely.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, President Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and praised his "amazing story" of success, just days after publicly demanding his immediate resignation. The initial call for resignation was prompted by questions from Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's past ties to China. Following a meeting that included the Secretaries of Commerce and the Treasury, Trump announced that Tan and his cabinet would work together on future suggestions. This abrupt change in tone reflects the administration's volatile but hands-on approach to the semiconductor industry amid the ongoing tech competition with China.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The project, proposed by a New York-based developer, is planned for a current parking lot and will include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and vehicle parking. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, reflecting a challenging financial climate for new housing projects. High interest rates, rising material costs, and labor uncertainties are significant hurdles for developers, even with high demand for housing in the city.</p>
