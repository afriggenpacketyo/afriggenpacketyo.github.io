            <p>Harvard University has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent proposed funding cuts, escalating a dispute over diversity initiatives and anti-Semitism concerns. The lawsuit challenges the administration's freeze of $2 billion in federal funding and threats to the university's tax-exempt status. Harvard's president, Alan M. Garber, argues that the government's actions constitute an overreach with severe and long-lasting consequences for the university's operations, students, and faculty. The university aims to protect its academic freedom and research funding from governmental interference.</p>

            <p>The stock market is experiencing a downturn as a result of President Trump's tariff policies and his ongoing criticisms of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has publicly pressured Powell to lower interest rates, even suggesting his termination, which has rattled investors. A recent poll indicates that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's tariff policy and handling of inflation. These economic uncertainties are contributing to market instability and investor anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rumors have spread online claiming that Barron Trump, son of President Donald Trump, was rejected from Harvard, Stanford, and Columbia University. These rumors have been linked to the White House's efforts to cut funding from these schools, though there is no evidence to support these claims. Google searches and searches of the president's Truth Social posts have not yielded any information confirming these alleged rejections. Barron Trump currently attends New York University, breaking from his family's tradition of attending the University of Pennsylvania or Georgetown University.</p>
