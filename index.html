          <p>President Trump admitted in an interview that he has the power to help Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongly deported from Maryland, return to the United States, however he stated that he will not use this power because he believes Mr. Abrego Garcia is a gang member. This statement contradicts earlier claims by his aides that the administration could not bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back, despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his release. Trump also defended sending Mr. Abrego Garcia to a terrorist prison in El Salvador, dismissing concerns about the deportation being an 'administrative error'. Mr. Abrego Garcia has never been charged with gang membership, and some judges have questioned the evidence linking him to MS-13.</p>

          <p>Toy makers and retailers are halting holiday orders due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, raising concerns about potential shortages and price increases. China produces a significant portion of toys and Christmas goods sold in America, and the tariffs have caused drastic cost markups for American companies. Many businesses are pausing orders, hoping for a reversal of the tariffs, but some are consulting bankruptcy lawyers. The Toy Association warns of a frozen supply chain that puts Christmas at risk, with surveys indicating that many small toy manufacturers may go out of business if the tariffs remain in place.</p>

          <p>This year's British local elections are characterized by a paradox of widespread anger and an expectation of indifference, leading to potentially unpredictable outcomes. Turnout is expected to be low, and there is a splintering of party support in various directions. Analysts suggest that the mainstream is dead, with multiple parties having a chance to make inroads. Both Labour and the Conservatives are reportedly feeling pessimistic about the elections, leaving room for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and independent candidates to gain ground.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has criticized the Trump administration's termination of immigration records for thousands of foreign students, calling the process 'arbitrary and capricious'. The judge, Ana Reyes, demanded detailed explanations for the terminations, highlighting the case of Akshar Patel, whose SEVIS record was terminated due to a speeding ticket. Reyes questioned the lack of individualized determination in the process and expressed concern for the impact on international students. She noted that the government had already assessed Patel's speeding ticket and found it not to be a reason to revoke his status.</p>

          <p>President Trump eased the impact of his new 25 percent tariffs on the auto industry to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. The relief allows American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the United States to claim some reimbursements. Under the relief, a manufacturer will be allowed to offset 15 percent of the suggested retail price of an automobile assembled in the United States during the first year of the tariffs and 10 percent in the second year.</p>
