          <p>Despite claims from the Department of Defense that the U.S. accepted a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar, the agreement is still under legal review. Qatar wants to clarify that the Trump administration initiated discussions about donating the jet. The plan to accept the jet has raised security concerns, with some lawmakers fearing it could grant a foreign nation access to sensitive systems. Trump has defended the gift as a "very nice gesture," stating it would be "stupid" to decline such an offer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's global tariff policy has encountered a significant obstacle as a federal court has ruled that he lacks the authority to unilaterally impose certain levies. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, arguing that it could lead to a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and weaken the president's leverage in trade negotiations. In related news, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the administration will aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities as the dispute with Harvard continues to escalate. </p>

          <p>Israeli attacks on Gaza have resulted in over 60 deaths, according to local health officials, amidst chaotic aid distribution efforts. The United Nations criticizes the new Israeli-backed aid system, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, as insufficient, noting a recent incident where hungry Palestinians looted a U.N. warehouse. Israel and Hamas are considering a new cease-fire proposal which includes the release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a 60-day cessation of hostilities, though disagreements persist on the terms for a permanent end to fighting. Gaza's health ministry reports hospitals are overwhelmed, and the situation is catastrophic due to the lack of adequate medical care.</p>

          <p>Industry tracker IWSR projects that non-alcoholic beer will overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide by volume this year. While overall beer volume declined by 1% in 2024, non-alcoholic beer volume grew by 9%, driven by consumers reducing alcohol consumption and improved taste of zero-proof alternatives. Lager remains the largest beer category with 92% market share, though non-alcoholic beer sales surpassed $17 billion in 2023, with Germany, Spain, and Japan leading global markets. The U.S. ranks sixth in non-alcoholic beer sales, fueled by brands like Athletic Brewing, and celebrity endorsements are further boosting the trend.</p>

Cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue.

He emphasized that monetary policy would support "maximum employment and stable prices," aligning with the Fed's dual mandate. The meeting occurred amidst tariff uncertainty, with a U.S. trade court ruling some of Trump's tariffs illegal, while the president has previously pressured Powell to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>Focus groups with Trump voters reveal they value congressional loyalty to the president over independent legislative action. Participants praised lawmakers who backed Trump's agenda and criticized those who dissented, including members of the House Freedom Caucus and moderate senators. They expressed disdain for Mitch McConnell, viewing him as an obstructionist. This perspective highlights the pressure on Republican lawmakers to align with Trump, even at the expense of their own reservations, to maintain support from a significant portion of their base.</p>
