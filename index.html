          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original November vote was annulled by the courts due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The annulled vote saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, prompting an investigation into his campaign's financing and organization. George Simion, a Georgescu ally from the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), is expected to progress to a second-round run-off. The decision to annul the election and ban Georgescu from the re-run was criticized by US Vice President JD Vance and US President Donald Trump's advisor Elon Musk, as well as the Kremlin which has publicly supported Georgescu's candidacy.</p>

          <p>China's Canton Fair, the country's oldest and largest trade exhibition, is experiencing a significant increase in foreign buyers, with over 200,000 attendees from various corners of the globe. This surge in international participation comes as rapidly intensifying tariffs from the US are throwing the established trade order into disarray, making the presence of American buyers seem less prominent compared to previous fairs. Organizers and exporters are reportedly focused on providing premium service to overseas buyers, with language support available in Spanish, Russian, and Arabic. The fair highlights China's efforts to diversify its trade relationships amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>As France commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Nazi surrender, World War II survivors recount their painful experiences during the German occupation and the deportation of Jews and others to death camps. Genevieve Perrier, Esther Senot, and Ginette Kolinka, now close to 100 years old, share their memories of fear, deprivation, and persecution. Senot recalls being arrested in Paris by French police at 15 and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, while Kolinka, deported at 19, describes the horrors of the concentration camps. These women are committed to preserving the memory of the war and educating future generations about the dangers of hatred and indifference.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is gaining credibility following Reform UK's recent electoral successes, shaking up the UK's political landscape. Reform UK won its first parliamentary by-election and mayoral race, signaling a potential shift in the two-party system. While Labour focuses on proving its effectiveness in government, the Conservatives face the challenge of remaining relevant, as Reform UK gains traction by tapping into public disillusionment with the traditional parties. Reform's success has prompted politicians in both major parties to consider the depth of public dissatisfaction with the political system and the need to address it effectively.</p>

Increased scrutiny of property deals and geopolitical friction are discouraging some buyers, leading them to seek friendlier investment alternatives.

The program, which has been a Republican priority, faced opposition from Democrats and rural Republicans who argue it will drain resources from public schools.

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from his first term's uneasy alliances to a more loyalist-driven approach in his second term. Klein posits that Trump's first administration was characterized by tension between his disinhibition and the moderating influences of his staff and the Republican Party, preventing his most destructive ideas from being enacted. In contrast, Klein asserts that Trump's second term is structured like a royal court, with loyalists and enforcers prioritizing his favor over dissent, leading to a presidency marked by ferocity and recklessness.</p>

He highlights specific instances of violence and conflict in Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, and Gaza, noting the UN's struggles to address these crises due to political fragmentation and under-resourcing. Tisdall suggests that a loss of faith, trust, and moral purpose contributes to a depleted sense of connection, enabling the spread of atrocities like a virus.</p>

Malta's Prime Minister stated that the country will respect the court's decision and rework the system.
