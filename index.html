          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas and ease the blockade of Gaza due to a soaring death toll and near-famine conditions. Hamas-run Health Ministry reported numerous deaths from Israeli strikes, while the IDF claims to be targeting Hamas and securing hostages. Netanyahu permitted limited aid into Gaza after pressure from allies concerned about mass famine images. The UN's World Food Program warns that the aid is insufficient, with thousands of children facing severe acute malnutrition, and international leaders threaten sanctions over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The article highlights the ongoing conflict's devastating impact on civilians and the growing international calls for a resolution.</p>

          <p>Germany is considering measures to lower electricity prices for industrial companies to prevent business closures and relocation, but critics fear the plan could threaten market stability and climate goals. While German industrial electricity prices were around the European average in 2022, they are significantly higher than in the US and China. The proposed relief includes reducing the electricity tax and cutting surcharges and grid fees. While some industry leaders support the plan, others argue it contradicts the needs of a renewable energy system and may reduce incentives for energy efficiency. The article examines the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed subsidies and the challenges of balancing industrial competitiveness with environmental sustainability.</p>

          <p>Ahmed Ebid, a 42-year-old Egyptian fisherman based in the UK, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for his involvement in a £12 million illegal boat crossing operation that smuggled nearly 3,800 people from North Africa to Italy. Ebid's role included bribing officials and threatening migrants. He arrived in the UK in 2022 and applied for asylum, remaining in legal limbo until his sentencing. The judge emphasized that Ebid ruthlessly exploited desperate individuals, prioritizing profit over human lives, and that his primary motivation was financial gain. His sentence means he will almost certainly be deported once it has been served.</p>

The Culture series envisions a post-scarcity society valuing empathy and cooperation, directly opposing the tech right's worldview. The article suggests that the billionaires may be attracted to the technological prowess depicted in the series, overlooking its core message about the importance of social justice and the dangers of unchecked capitalism.
