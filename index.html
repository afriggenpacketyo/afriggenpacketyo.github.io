          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been formally charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm following a ten-month investigation. The charges, which involve a "double-digit" number of victims, include one case of sexual assault involving intercourse, two without, four cases of sexual assault, and two of bodily harm. Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title, has publicly admitted to past violence under the influence of drugs and alcohol but denies wrongdoing in most of the current cases, particularly those concerning sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>The NHL's first semi-remote draft has drawn criticism from team executives like Kings GM Ken Holland for its lack of traditional atmosphere and numerous technical glitches. The new format involved players being congratulated via video calls, which were marred by audio problems and delays, creating awkward moments for the draftees. While the draft proceeded with top picks like Matthew Schaefer going to the Islanders, many felt the decentralized event detracted from the celebratory experience for the young athletes. The article also notes the Kings traded their first-round pick and are focused on re-signing key free agents.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue negotiations over tariffs, with a significant deadline in early July looming. Discussions in Washington were described as "fruitful," but major differences remain, particularly concerning U.S. tariffs on Japan's automotive industry, which have already impacted the sector. The Trump administration has hinted at the possibility of extending the 90-day pause on certain country-specific tariffs, though President Trump has also expressed a desire to impose them. Japan faces a potential 24 percent total tariff rate if an agreement is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has reported the successful completion of the world's first human trial for a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which involves inserting a stent electrode via a neck vein, helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The method is presented as a lower-risk alternative to open-skull surgeries, such as those performed by Elon Musk's Neuralink, potentially reducing surgical trauma and recovery time. The procedure was performed on a 67-year-old patient who had been paralyzed on one side following a stroke.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in connection with a sophisticated, Russia-based criminal operation that attempted to defraud the U.S. Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The indictment alleges the group stole personal information from over a million Medicare recipients to submit fraudulent claims for expensive medical equipment that was never provided. The scheme involved purchasing legitimate medical equipment companies to process the false claims, with Medicare paying out approximately $41 million and supplemental insurers losing an estimated $900 million. Illicit proceeds were laundered through international shell companies and cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4 on Friday, securing sole possession of the best record in the MLB despite a performance their manager described as incomplete. Shohei Ohtani hit his 29th home run, and a two-run homer from Max Muncy contributed to the offense, but the team struggled overall with defensive errors and a quiet lineup late in the game. The victory came down to a game-ending double play in the ninth inning with the bases loaded. The win highlights the team's ability to grind out victories even when not playing at its peak.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that school districts must allow parents to opt their children out of lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs, specifically concerning the use of LGBTQ-themed storybooks in a Maryland elementary school curriculum. The case centered on nine picture books, including "Uncle Bobby's Wedding" and "Pride Puppy," which were part of an effort to represent diverse families. The majority opinion argued that the books promote messages contrary to some parents' religious principles, while the dissent countered that the ruling fails to accept the existence of LGBTQ people in society.</p>

Prices across the solar supply chain fell by 60 to 80 percent in 2024, leading to billions in losses and pushing many of the nation's producers into the red. The mood at a recent major industry conference in Shanghai was described as weary, with many top executives absent.

This marks a shift from the past few years and reflects, according to experts, a growing concern within the Indo-Pacific that conflicts in the Middle East are distracting the United States. The decision to skip the summit suggests that these nations are prioritizing regional matters.

          <p>Canadian businesses are struggling with significant uncertainty and financial losses due to the shifting nature of U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Business owners express frustration over the inability to plan for the future, with one likening the unpredictable policy changes to "dealing with the mob." The tariff war has slowed Canada's economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., impacting both the manufacturing and service sectors. Despite ongoing talks between the two governments, the lack of a stable trade agreement leaves many Canadian firms in a precarious position. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, the future of birthright citizenship in the U.S. remains uncertain. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order to end the practice, the decision allows the administration to begin planning its implementation in states not covered by narrowed injunctions. Many practical questions, such as how citizenship status would be verified at birth, remain unanswered by the White House. Legal challenges to the order's constitutionality are expected to continue in lower courts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 53-47 to defeat a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran. The vote occurred amid lingering Democratic frustration over the lack of transparency surrounding recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Proponents of the measure argued that the power to declare war rests with Congress, while opponents contended it would unconstitutionally constrain the president's ability to respond to threats. The debate highlights the deep partisan divide over executive war powers and the administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' extensive flood protection system are sinking, some at a rate of nearly two inches per year, faster than sea levels are rising. Using satellite radar data, researchers identified sinking hotspots in the concrete flood walls and levees that were reinforced with $15 billion after Hurricane Katrina. This subsidence reduces the system's capacity to block storm surges and increases flood risk for the low-lying city. The study calls for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure the integrity of the critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has significantly limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block executive branch policies across the entire country. The ruling came from a case involving President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, though the court did not decide the policy's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that such broad orders exceed the authority granted to courts. The decision is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced numerous nationwide injunctions, but the dissenting justices warned it abdicates the court's role in protecting the rule of law.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill currently in the U.S. Senate could lead to devastating healthcare cuts in his state. He estimated that as many as 3.4 million Californians could lose their Medi-Cal coverage due to proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Newsom argued the bill would be particularly damaging for rural communities, potentially forcing the closure of struggling hospitals and driving up insurance premiums for others. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the requirements would leave 4.8 million people uninsured nationwide over a decade.</p>

The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables among nearly 12,500 employees. The findings indicated that those who adhered to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, even after accounting for other potential factors. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in the diet, could play a role in supporting mental well-being.</p>
