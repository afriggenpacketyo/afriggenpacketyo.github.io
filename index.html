          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has made a direct appeal to resident doctors in England to halt their planned five-day strike over pay, warning it would be a "damaging" and a "huge loss for the NHS." The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding pay restoration to 2008 levels in real terms, arguing that wages have been significantly eroded despite recent raises. The government maintains it cannot afford the BMA's demands but has offered to negotiate on working conditions, while NHS England expresses concern over patient safety and service disruptions.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed his understanding of President Trump's frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating he believes Powell faces a "rocky road." While Johnson agrees with Trump that interest rates should be lowered to address issues like the housing crisis, he acknowledged the legal complexities of potentially firing the Fed chair. The Speaker argued that reducing rates could solve affordability problems and save the nation money, describing the current economic situation as one where "desperate times call for desperate measures."

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September. The decision aims to promote a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, with Macron calling for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and massive humanitarian aid for Gaza. The move was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it rewards terrorism and would create a launchpad to "annihilate Israel."</p>

          <p>In a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, Donald Trump publicly clashed with Chair Jerome Powell over the cost of the central bank's building renovations. Trump claimed the project cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately disputed. The visit underscores the ongoing pressure from the White House for the Fed to lower interest rates, a move Powell has resisted due to inflation concerns and economic uncertainty from tariffs. The event highlights the erosion of the traditional independence of the central bank from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

The order seeks to reverse judicial precedents that protect unhoused people and redirect federal funds towards rehabilitation and treatment rather than housing-first initiatives. This move follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that permits cities to penalize sleeping in public, even without available shelter.

In response, his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, launched the festival, which ran for over two decades and became a crucial platform for both established and emerging metal bands like System of a Down and Disturbed. Despite its success, the festival eventually ceased due to rising costs and greedy demands from managers and agents. The article reflects on Ozzfest's legacy in nurturing the metal subculture and providing a vital stage for the genre.</p>

          <p>Following a series of heated protests and 17 arrests, the Epping Forest District Council has unanimously voted to urge the UK government to shut down the Bell Hotel, which is being used to house asylum seekers. The unrest began after a resident of the hotel was charged with sexual assault. Council leader Chris Whitbread expressed concern that the protests were being infiltrated by political extremists and were causing lasting harm to the community. The situation has divided local residents, with some supporting the protests and others feeling uncomfortable with the escalating tensions and violence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order that temporarily blocks a federal appeals court decision that would have severely weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The lower court's ruling had claimed that private citizens could not bring lawsuits to enforce the law's ban on racial discrimination in elections, a move that would have effectively nullified the act in seven states. While the Supreme Court's order averts an immediate threat to the landmark civil rights law, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented, signaling that a significant faction of the court is open to gutting the legislation.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexual assault, citing a lack of credibility in the complainant's allegations. The judge, Maria Carroccia, ruled that the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof against the players, who were charged in connection with an incident in a London, Ontario, hotel room in 2018. In her five-hour verdict explanation, the judge pointed to inconsistencies in the woman's testimony and noted that her claims of being heavily intoxicated were not supported by surveillance video. The players, four of whom were in the NHL, have been on indefinite leave.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual meeting, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for several hours at a federal courthouse in Florida. According to her lawyer, Maxwell answered every question posed to her truthfully and did not invoke any privileges. The meeting was arranged by the Department of Justice amid growing public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information related to Epstein's sex trafficking network. The discussion was intended to determine what Maxwell knows about other potential abusers connected to the disgraced financier.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Finds Trump Administration's Immigration Policy Has Shifted to a New Form of Family Separation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's approach to immigration has evolved into a less visible but systematic form of family separation, according to this article. Instead of the public scenes of children being taken from parents at the border, the administration is now dismantling protections for unaccompanied minors by bureaucratic means. This includes prolonging detention, cutting funding for legal services, and creating stricter requirements for family members, or "sponsors," to claim children. These changes effectively use the child welfare system as an enforcement tool, creating what the article calls a "Family Separation 2.0" that deters migration by making reunification more difficult.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional, finding it violates the 2nd Amendment. The court's majority opinion stated that the law "meaningfully constrains the right to keep operable arms" and is not consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by a 2022 Supreme Court decision. Gun violence prevention groups condemned the ruling, noting the law had stopped hundreds of prohibited individuals from buying ammunition, while gun rights activists celebrated it as a major victory.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines' stock fell over 11% after the company reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and significantly cut its profit forecast for 2025. The carrier cited weaker-than-expected domestic travel demand and increased discounting during the summer, though CEO Bob Jordan noted a recent positive inflection in demand. The airline is in the midst of overhauling its business model, including moving away from open seating to assigned seats. The poor outlook from Southwest echoes similar guidance from other major U.S. carriers, signaling broader uncertainty in the domestic travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's revenue fell 12% year-over-year, missing analyst estimates, as it faces increased competition and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. Management did not provide official guidance for the rest of the year, which some analysts interpret as a signal that the company no longer forecasts volume growth in 2025.

The comments come as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to release more information about the deceased sex offender's network.

The consultant, Jeff Small, claimed the effort was part of implementing a presidential executive order on election integrity. The clerks, shocked by the request, refused, noting that allowing such access would be illegal and a felony in the state. The outreach has raised alarms among election officials, who view it as an unprecedented and inappropriate attempt to interfere with state-administered election systems.</p>
