          <p>The trial of healthcare workers involved in Diego Maradona's death is in jeopardy after a judge recused herself due to participation in a documentary about the case, potentially violating impartiality laws. Judge Julieta Makintach stepped down following accusations of behaving like an actress rather than a judge after a trailer for the documentary was played in court. The documentary reportedly included recordings allegedly made inside the courtroom, violating court rules. The remaining judges will decide whether the trial proceeds or a new one is ordered, as seven members of Maradona's medical team face charges of negligent homicide in connection to his death in 2020.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable because existing shareholders are selling more shares (60%) than the company itself (40%), a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. While Circle did not comment on the reason for the decision, the company is profitable and has almost $850 million in cash and equivalents. The large proportion of insider sales may reflect venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns and a multiyear drought in IPOs. The company stands to raise another $240 million in the IPO, based on the midpoint of its expected range of $24 to $26 a share. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the White House's insistence that tax cuts will boost revenue, Musk's criticism highlights concerns about the bill's fiscal impact.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are experiencing higher unemployment rates, accounting for 12% of the national unemployment rate increase since mid-2023. The unemployment rate among recent college grads is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, which is a first in 45 years. This is attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech industry. Economic uncertainty driven by tariffs also contributes to businesses pausing growth and investment, further impacting employment prospects for recent graduates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, potentially salvaging vacuum-tube maglev systems. Researchers found that even minor imperfections in the track could cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride "pronounced, but not unpleasant." The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests for the study.</p>
