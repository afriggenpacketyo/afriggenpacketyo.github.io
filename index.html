          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure savings option with returns currently outpacing the inflation rate. The article notes that while national average yields for CDs are modest, top rates, especially from online banks, are significantly higher. It highlights that short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, are presently offering higher yields than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. This makes them an attractive vehicle for savers looking to lock in high rates safely. (not investment advice)</p>

The IDF stated the operation was aimed at individuals directly responsible for the October 7th attacks and for managing the ongoing war. According to reports from Al-Jazeera, the strike hit a meeting where leaders were discussing a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal. The Israeli military claimed it took measures to mitigate civilian harm by utilizing precise munitions and intelligence.</p>

          <p>The article details significant changes to U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has declared that healthy children and pregnant women should not receive COVID-19 vaccines. This move has caused dissent within the CDC and has been opposed by major medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics. Amid this conflicting guidance between the federal government and the medical establishment, the article advises parents to consult trusted physicians and professional medical societies. It also explores the potential implications for insurance coverage of vaccines that are no longer federally recommended.</p>

          <p>An international study published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that increasing potassium intake could lower the risk of serious heart problems. The research followed 1,200 high-risk patients with implantable defibrillators, finding that those who increased their potassium levels through diet or supplements had a significantly lower incidence of dangerous heart rhythms, hospitalizations, or death. Researchers concluded that raising potassium to mid-to-high normal levels could be an inexpensive and effective treatment strategy for patients with a wide range of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

          <h2>Career Experts Debate Likelihood of a 'September Surge' in Hiring</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career experts are divided on whether the traditional 'September surge' in job hiring will occur this year following a slow summer market. Historically, hiring picks up in the fall as companies aim to use remaining budgets and meet year-end goals. However, some recruiters express caution, citing recession fears and cost-cutting measures as potential dampeners on a significant hiring rebound. To prepare, experts advise job seekers to update their LinkedIn profiles to match their resumes and to be strategic in their applications rather than applying indiscriminately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates remaining high, homeowners have several options to reduce their monthly payments without waiting for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Experts suggest three main strategies: refinancing to a lower rate if the current rate is above 7%, applying for a mortgage recast by making a large lump-sum payment to lower the principal, or seeking a loan modification in cases of financial hardship. Each option has different requirements, costs, and impacts on the loan terms, so homeowners should carefully assess their financial situation to choose the most suitable path.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Oil Change International reports that U.S. government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to nearly $31 billion per year, a figure that has more than doubled since 2017. The report identifies major support mechanisms, including foreign tax credits and credits for carbon capture, which primarily benefit oil and gas extraction. Despite President Joe Biden's pledge to eliminate such handouts, the analysis finds that recent legislation signed by President Trump is set to provide an additional $4 billion annually to the industry, posing a significant barrier to decarbonization efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to use presidential immunity to overturn the $83.3 million verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court ruled that Trump failed to provide any grounds that would warrant reconsidering its prior holding on the matter. This decision upholds the jury's 2024 finding that Trump defamed Carroll when he denied her accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. The ruling solidifies a major legal and financial consequence for the former president stemming from the case.</p>

          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has stated that athletes competing in the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo will face significant "heat challenges." The warning comes as Japan experiences its hottest summer on record, with temperatures well above average. The nine-day event is scheduled to begin with the 35km race walk on a day forecast to reach 32°C (89.6°F). Coe noted that similar heat challenges were present during the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, indicating that organizers and athletes will need to take precautions to manage the extreme conditions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Prominence of Boeing Aircraft in Trump Administration Trade Deals</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals negotiated by the Trump administration. Experts suggest that high-value, high-profile airplane deals serve as visible symbols of reducing bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S., a key goal for President Trump. Unlike agricultural or steel imports, purchasing American-made aircraft is often not politically sensitive for partner countries. Furthermore, the long delivery timelines for these orders mean countries can announce major purchases without immediate financial strain, making them a pragmatic and performative tool in international trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>An activist group organizing an aid flotilla to Gaza has claimed one of its boats was attacked by a drone while docked in Tunisia. The Global Sumud Flotilla released security footage appearing to show an incendiary device being dropped onto the vessel, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished by the crew. While Tunisian authorities initially attributed the fire to accidental causes, they have reportedly formed a special committee to investigate after viewing the video. The flotilla aims to challenge Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the Boko Haram insurgency is renewing its offensive in Nigeria, with a significant increase in killings and attacks in the first half of 2025. Analysts attribute the resurgence to several factors, including Niger's withdrawal from a multinational joint task force, which has made the border more porous for arms smuggling. Additionally, the Nigerian military's resources are stretched thin by other security challenges across the country. Despite military claims of stability, residents in affected areas report ongoing fear and a lack of state control.</p>

          <p>Zookeepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, UK, are celebrating what they describe as one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom: a "virgin birth." A female casque-headed iguana, which had never mated with a male, successfully produced eight healthy hatchlings through a natural phenomenon called parthenogenesis. This process allows unfertilized eggs to develop into embryos, resulting in offspring that are genetic clones of the mother. The zoo highlights the event as a significant moment for both scientific understanding and conservation education.</p>

          <p>France has been plunged into political crisis after Prime Minister François Bayrou and his minority government were ousted in a no-confidence vote. The collapse was triggered by a deadlock over the 2026 budget, as Bayrou failed to secure support for proposed spending cuts aimed at reducing the country's large deficit. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a new prime minister, his fifth in under two years, or risk calling another snap election that could further empower far-right or far-left parties. The ongoing instability raises concerns about France's ability to implement necessary fiscal reforms.</p>
