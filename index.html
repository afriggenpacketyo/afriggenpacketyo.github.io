          <p>The BBC has stated it regrets not cutting the live broadcast of the band Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance, during which the lead singer initiated chants of "death to the IDF." Following criticism from the UK government and the broadcast regulator Ofcom, the BBC condemned the singer's remarks as unacceptable antisemitic sentiments. The corporation announced it will review its guidelines for live events to prevent similar incidents. Glastonbury organizers also condemned the chants, stating they "crossed a line" and that there is no place for hate speech at the festival.</p>

          <p>Iran's judiciary has officially acknowledged that an Israeli airstrike on Tehran's notorious Evin prison resulted in at least 71 deaths, including prisoners, staff, and visitors. The attack, part of a broader 12-day Israeli operation against Iranian targets, also killed a top prosecutor known for handling dissident cases. This confirmation comes amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program. The head of the IAEA stated that while the damage was severe, Iran retains the capacity to resume its nuclear activities within months.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to release further details on concessions made to its controversial welfare reform bill in an effort to prevent a rebellion among Labour MPs. After facing significant opposition, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's administration scaled back the proposed cuts, reducing projected savings from Â£5 billion to Â£2 billion. The reforms, which aim to restrict eligibility for certain disability benefits, still face opposition from dozens of MPs who fear the changes will push vulnerable people into poverty. The government argues the reforms are necessary to create a more sustainable and fair benefits system.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a warning that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) is flawed and can lead to people receiving less money than they invested. The product, designed for first-time home buyers or retirement savings, imposes a significant penalty for early withdrawals, causing some to lose part of their original capital. The committee's report criticized the LISA's complexity, its potential for being mis-sold, and its nonsensical rules that penalize benefit claimants.

The 2018 operation involved monitoring the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City to identify and track an FBI official and their contacts. The hacker used the official's phone number to access geolocation data and call logs, which the cartel then used to intimidate and murder potential witnesses.

          <p>UEFA has delayed its decision on whether Crystal Palace can compete in the next Europa League, a spot the club earned by winning the FA Cup. The issue stems from multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. The decision is now pending the outcome of Lyon's appeal against a demotion to Ligue 2 by French football authorities due to financial issues. If Lyon's relegation is upheld, they would relinquish their Europa League spot, likely clearing the way for Crystal Palace's participation.</p>

It argues that as these cities grow and attract more affluent residents, they are adopting the same restrictive zoning laws and NIMBYist attitudes that caused the housing crisis in places like California. This trend threatens the role of the Sun Belt as a "pressure-release valve" for the national housing market, as the forces of anti-development sentiment are proving to be a nationwide phenomenon.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that understanding dogs requires recognizing that smell is their primary sense. In an interview, she describes how dogs construct a spatial and temporal map of their world through olfaction, where scents provide information rather than just being categorized as good or bad. For a dog, a person's presence lingers as a fading scent long after they've left a room, effectively encoding the passage of time in smell. This fundamental difference in perception creates a delightful mystery in the human-canine relationship.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center is tracking a disturbance that could stall over Florida and potentially develop into a tropical or subtropical system around the July Fourth holiday weekend. The system is currently a frontal boundary stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic, with a 20 percent chance of formation over the next seven days. While the direct threat remains low, the system could bring heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and a high rip current risk to Florida's coasts. This comes as the second named storm of the season, Barry, dissipated after making landfall in Mexico.</p>

          <p>Following the recent U.S.-Iran conflict, American security agencies issued warnings about potential retaliatory attacks from Iranian-backed "sleeper cells" on U.S. soil. This article examines the credibility of such threats, noting that while Iran and its proxies have a history of conducting foreign operations, a direct attack on the U.S. homeland would be a significant escalation. Experts suggest that these cells are likely a contingency asset for Iran, to be used only in moments of existential desperation, and that current political rhetoric may be overstating the immediate danger for domestic political purposes.</p>

          <p>New analysis suggests that the global population will begin to decline around 2055, nearly thirty years earlier than the United Nations' 2084 projection. Economist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde found that the UN's models are consistently too optimistic, as real-world birth rates in many middle-income and even some low-income countries are plummeting far faster than expected. The UN's model assumes that fertility rates will eventually rebound or stabilize, but current data shows an accelerating decline. This trend indicates the world is already below replacement-level fertility, guaranteeing a future population shrink with significant economic consequences.</p>

The author argues that Parker's departure after the 2020 season, due to a toxic culture, marked the beginning of the team's decline into a five-year funk without a playoff appearance. The article contrasts the franchise's past glory, embodied by Parker's successful tenure, with its present state of lacking talent, direction, and hope.

          <h2>Designers Offer Advice on Elevating Bathroom Art Beyond Potty Humor</h2>

          <p>Interior designers argue that bathrooms are often a missed opportunity for decor and should be treated with the same artistic consideration as any other room. Instead of clichÃ©d or humorous prints, experts suggest using sophisticated or personal art to create a focal point and distract from the room's utilitarian function. The article provides tips, such as using bold paintings, whimsical pieces, or even children's artwork to add personality. While moisture is a concern, well-ventilated spaces can house valuable pieces, and designers encourage thinking broadly about what constitutes art, from postcards to elegant sketches.</p>

          <p>This commentary uses the recent tragic boating accident on Lake Tahoe, which killed eight people, as a crucial lesson in boating safety. The author, a longtime boater, argues that the incident was not caused by a completely unexpected storm, as weather services had forecast strong winds that should have served as a clear warning to stay off the water. The piece offers fundamental safety rules, such as closely monitoring weather forecasts, heading to shore at the first sign of white caps, and not overloading vessels. It emphasizes that caution is paramount, especially on large, unpredictable bodies of water like Lake Tahoe.</p>

          <p>Jurors are set to begin deliberations in the trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces federal charges including racketeering and sex trafficking. Prosecutors have alleged that Combs ran a mob-like criminal enterprise that used violence, drugs, and a network of employees to coerce women into sexual acts and subsequently cover up the crimes. The defense has acknowledged that Combs behaved badly but argues the charges are exaggerated and do not meet the legal elements for conviction. The trial featured six weeks of graphic testimony from 34 witnesses, including former partners and employees.</p>

          <p>While Hollywood approaches artificial intelligence with caution, China's entertainment industry is adopting a more aggressive strategy, highlighted by a new government-backed project. The China Film Foundation plans to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu movies, including those starring Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, for modern global audiences through methods like AI-powered animation. This no-holds-barred approach reflects a wider cultural acceptance of AI in China and contrasts sharply with the concerns over labor and intellectual property that dominate the conversation in the U.S. entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Restaurant owners and workers in Los Angeles are navigating a climate of fear and economic disruption following a series of sweeping arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The industry, which relies heavily on undocumented immigrant labor, has seen staff shortages and a drop in customers as people stay home to avoid being profiled. In response, some restaurant owners are organizing "Know Your Rights" workshops and creating rapid response networks to support their staff. The situation highlights the deep-seated confusion and frustration within an industry trying to protect its vulnerable workforce.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including Neuralink, Precision Neuroscience, and Blackrock Neurotech, are on the verge of bringing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology from the lab to the market. These surgically implanted devices are designed to help people with paralysis or an inability to speak by decoding their brain signals to control computers, move prosthetic limbs, or generate artificial speech. While Neuralink has garnered significant public attention, competitors are also making strides with less invasive technologies. The first commercial products will likely focus on allowing users to control a computer cursor or smartphone with their thoughts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metals Company, led by CEO Gerard Barron, is aiming to become the first to commercially mine the deep ocean floor, targeting a mineral-rich area in the Pacific Ocean. The company argues that harvesting polymetallic nodules containing nickel and cobalt from the seabed is less environmentally damaging than land-based mining and can help the U.S. achieve mineral independence. A recent executive order from President Trump promoting deep-sea mining has provided a "lifeline" to the industry, prompting the company to seek fast-tracked approval from U.S. federal agencies, despite opposition from scientists and other nations.</p>
