          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who escaped on May 25 by impersonating a corrections officer, was found approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit. Arkansas law enforcement officers and the U.S. Border Patrol located Hardin near Moccasin Creek, where tracking dogs picked up his scent. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement, particularly the Trump administration for sending a Border Patrol team, for their efforts in apprehending Hardin, who is now back in custody.</p>

Instead of enjoying his night off, Baker, still wearing his graduation sash and medals, jumped behind the counter to assist his colleagues, who were overwhelmed with orders. Maria Mendoza, a customer, captured the act on video and started a crowdfunding campaign to reward Baker's dedication. The campaign has raised over $200,000, which Baker plans to use to attend trade school and become a master auto mechanic, and the Burger King Foundation also surprised Baker and Mendoza with $10,000 each.</p>

          <p>Simone Biles and Riley Gaines engaged in a heated exchange over the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports. The dispute began when Gaines criticized a Minnesota high school softball team with a transgender pitcher, leading Biles to accuse Gaines of bullying and being a "sore loser." Biles suggested creating a separate transgender category in all sports to promote inclusivity, while Gaines argued that men do not belong in women's sports. The exchange highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes and fairness in competition, with studies showing that a majority believe biological males should not compete in women's sports.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling more than a dozen flights daily due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs, impacting Horizon Air, its regional subsidiary. The delayed aircraft, originally expected from Brazil, are subject to a 10% tariff since April, forcing Alaska to cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July. The airline is cutting routes with multiple flights to minimize disruption, aiming to reaccommodate affected passengers on alternative travel plans.</p>

While starting a new party faces challenges, including ballot access and campaign finance regulations, Musk's engagement in politics could signal a challenge to Trump's influence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public feud with President Donald Trump. The conflict, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value and a breakdown in their relationship. This fallout could impact Tesla's regulatory landscape, government support, and tariff exemptions, adding to existing issues like increased competition and consumer backlash. The situation has prompted calls for Tesla's board to take action to ensure the company's stability and future, with some experts suggesting Musk's behavior is damaging the brand.</p>

          <p>A former girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Jane", testified about feeling pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, despite her discomfort. She alleged that a network of employees helped procure drugs for these encounters, known as "hotel nights" or "freak-offs", which caused her pain and frequent infections. Prosecutors have charged Mr Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Jane also testified about a financial "love contract" where Mr Combs agreed to give her a monthly allowance, which he would use to control her participation in the hotel nights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is finding it difficult to cut the amount of foreign aid used to pay for hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. Figures show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25. The money is largely used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers, and the Home Office claims it is committed to ending asylum hotels and speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. Critics argue the Home Office lacks incentive to reduce ODA spending, leading to cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities.</p>
