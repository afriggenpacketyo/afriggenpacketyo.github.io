          <p>Pfizer has entered into a significant licensing agreement with the Chinese biotech company 3SBio for a new cancer drug, SSGJ-707. Under the deal, Pfizer will invest up to US$150 million for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug within mainland China. Additionally, Pfizer acquired a 1.3% equity stake in 3SBio for HK$785 million, signaling strong interest from major pharmaceutical companies in China's growing biotech sector. The transaction highlights the increasing trend of foreign investment in Chinese intellectual property for drug research.</p>

          <h2>California's High-Speed Rail Project Highlights Broader State Fiscal Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 05:00:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that California's troubled high-speed rail project is symptomatic of a larger fiscal crisis within the state. The project, initially approved by voters in 2008 with a $40 billion budget, has seen its projected cost escalate to as high as $128 billion with little progress. The author contends this reflects wider issues of bureaucratic inefficiency, regulatory burdens, and fiscal mismanagement at multiple levels of government. The piece suggests that these problems, combined with a high cost of living, are driving residents and businesses out of the state.</p>

          <p>A panel of doctors has strongly urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its "black box" warning, the most severe safety label, from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause symptoms. Experts argue the current warnings, which list risks like cancer and dementia, are not supported by science for localized treatments and unnecessarily frighten women away from beneficial medication. This push comes amid a broader re-evaluation of hormone replacement therapy, with many in the medical community believing its risks were previously overstated, though some caution against a complete removal of warnings for all types of therapy.</p>

          <p>Pediatricians across the U.S. are reporting increased anxiety among parents regarding access to routine childhood immunizations. This concern has been amplified by the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary and his subsequent replacement of the entire CDC vaccine advisory committee (ACIP). Since ACIP recommendations determine which vaccines are covered by insurance, including Medicaid and the Vaccines for Children Program, parents fear that coverage for essential shots could be dropped. This uncertainty is prompting some families to schedule vaccinations as soon as their children become eligible.</p>

          <p>A new tax provision included in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" is causing significant concern among professional poker players and other gamblers.

This means players who break even or even lose money over a year could still face a substantial tax bill on their gross winnings. Prominent players and tax experts argue the change is illogical and could make professional gambling financially unviable for many, prompting bipartisan efforts in Congress to reverse it.

The recall effort, organized by civic groups with support from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), accuses the KMT legislators of being too close to Beijing. The outcome of this vote is seen as a crucial test of the "resist China, protect Taiwan" political narrative and could significantly influence the island's political landscape ahead of future elections. The recall has intensified political debate amid heightened military pressure from mainland China.</p>

          <p>The WNBA is experiencing a significant growth spurt, largely fueled by star rookie Caitlin Clark, but this has also brought increased debate and scrutiny. An analysis in the article addresses several key questions, including whether Clark is overrated by fans, the league's dependence on her, and the quality of officiating. While Clark's impact on attendance and ratings is undeniable, the league's overall health is also supported by other rising stars and strong fan bases. The piece concludes that while challenges exist, the league's fundamentals are strong and its popularity is not solely dependent on one player.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, rebounding from a drop in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise was largely attributed to a period of unusually hot weather, which boosted sales of fuel as more people traveled, as well as supermarket sales of drinks and summer clothing. Despite the monthly increase, the overall trend suggests that growth in retail spending has slowed, with sales up only 0.2% in the second quarter compared to the first. This aligns with other data indicating weaker consumer confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, a key tactical focus will be on exploiting Spain's high defensive line. England's forwards will need to make strategic runs into the space behind the Spanish defenders, a weakness Germany exposed in the semi-final. Another crucial element will be disrupting Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot player Patri Guijarro and containing the creative threats of Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas. While Spain is expected to dominate possession, England may find success by playing effectively in transition and maintaining strong defensive organization.</p>

          <p>With an August 1 deadline looming for India to finalize a trade deal with the U.S. before facing higher tariffs, New Delhi appears unconcerned. Analysts suggest India's confidence stems from its strategic importance to Washington as a counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific and within the BRICS bloc. The U.S. has an interest in shifting manufacturing from China to allies like India, giving New Delhi leverage in negotiations. Furthermore, India has been actively pursuing trade agreements with other partners, such as the UK and the EU, as part of a "multi-alignment" strategy that reduces its dependency on any single nation.

Described as one of the longest-serving prisoners for acts related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, his release had been a long-standing cause for left-wing activists. Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, allegedly due to pressure from the U.S. and Israel. An appeals court finally ruled his lengthy detention was "disproportionate," and he was immediately expelled to Lebanon.</p>
