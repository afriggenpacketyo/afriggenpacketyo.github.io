          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a drop in premarket trading after the company was not selected for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index during the latest quarterly rebalance, despite earlier speculation and a Bank of America recommendation. The S&P 500 rebalance is typically a significant event that can trigger substantial trading volume and passive fund investments, as seen with Coinbase's recent inclusion. Despite this setback, Robinhood's stock has doubled in price this year, rebounding from previous losses after the GameStop trading mania and the FTX collapse. The company's shares had reached a new record high last week amid a general recovery in both stocks and crypto markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Sikh temple in the U.S., Fremont Gurdwara Sahib, has urged the Department of Justice to investigate the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), alleging it acts as a foreign agent for the Indian government and Narendra Modi. The Gurdwara's letter claims HAF facilitates meetings between Indian officials and U.S. lawmakers and advocates for the interests of the Bharatiya Janata Party. HAF denies these claims, asserting its independence and non-partisanship, while accusing the Khalistan separatist movement of coordinated campaigns against them. The allegations come amid heightened tensions between Sikh separatists and the Indian government, with recent accusations of transnational repression against Sikhs in Canada and the U.S.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in Congress could significantly alter student loan programs, potentially making college less accessible for low-income families. The bill includes changes to Pell Grant eligibility, requiring students to take more credit hours to qualify for the maximum grant amount, and eliminating subsidized loans. Additionally, it imposes a lifetime cap on borrowing, which may not account for varying costs across states and universities, potentially worsening the doctor shortage. Critics argue that these cuts would disproportionately affect community college students and could drive students to private lenders with higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mayors of San Diego and Sacramento warn that California's homelessness crisis will worsen if state funding for the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention Grant Program (HHAP) is eliminated. They argue that HHAP grants are crucial for reducing encampments and providing a path to permanent housing for unsheltered individuals. Both cities have seen significant reductions in homelessness due to HHAP, but sustained investment is needed to address the scale of the crisis. The mayors urge the Legislature to fully fund HHAP at $1 billion, emphasizing the importance of accountability and the economic costs of inaction.</p>

Geely's vice president publicly backed Great Wallâ€™s claims, stating that Geely had conducted its own emissions tests and reached the same conclusions.
