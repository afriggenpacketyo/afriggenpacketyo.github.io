          <p>Heavy monsoon rains and cloudbursts have resulted in at least 37 deaths in India's northern state of Himachal Pradesh, with an additional 26 fatalities from related road accidents. The torrential downpours have caused widespread disruption, damaging homes and infrastructure, particularly in the severely affected Mandi district where 40 people are missing. Authorities are conducting extensive search, rescue, and rehabilitation efforts as meteorological services predict the severe weather will continue. Officials have linked the intensity of these weather events to the broader impacts of global climate change on the Himalayan region.</p>

          <h2>Meteor Fragments Believed to Have Landed in Scottish Highlands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 02:15:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland after it was seen streaking across the sky. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely broke up about 12 miles above the ground, scattering potential debris over a vast area near Ben Nevis. Dozens of residents reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with one witness describing their house shaking from the impact. Hillwalkers are being asked to look for the meteorite pieces, though finding them in the mountainous terrain will be challenging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has stated that the Home Office has no effective system to determine if foreign workers are leaving the country after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee's report accuses the department of failing to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020, showing "little curiosity" about its operation. The report also highlighted widespread evidence of worker exploitation, which it claims the Home Office has been slow to address. This scrutiny comes as the UK government aims to curb high net migration figures.</p>

          <p>One year after a landslide election win, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is facing significant challenges, including a sharp decline in his personal approval ratings. The government's primary economic goals of stimulating growth and improving household finances have largely failed to materialize amid high inflation and borrowing costs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been criticized for a series of policy U-turns, particularly on welfare, creating a difficult fiscal position ahead of the Autumn Budget. While some success has been achieved with international trade deals, the rise of the rival Reform UK party highlights widespread public disaffection.</p>

While taking responsibility for the process failures that led to the reversals, Starmer emphasized what he considers major achievements, including reducing NHS waiting lists and securing international trade deals.

The incident also resulted in a gas leak, downed power lines, and injuries to several animals, with a second woman treated for smoke inhalation.

Prosecutors presented evidence that the woman was unable to give consent, while the defense argued the encounter was consensual.

          <p>A mass shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and 14 others wounded. According to police, occupants of a dark vehicle opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party for a local rapper. The victims ranged in age from 21 to 32. Police believe the shooting was a targeted attack and are investigating the possibility of it being gang-related, mobilizing resources to prevent potential retaliation. This incident occurred at the same location as a previous deadly mass shooting in 2022 when it was under different management.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has renewed its commitment to tackling the persistent issues of oversupply and intense, low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated that it will comprehensively address "disorderly low-price competition" and guide companies toward phasing out outdated production capacity. This directive, echoing recent comments from President Xi Jinping, aims to promote healthy and sustainable development in the sector. The meeting with industry leaders acknowledged the difficulties they face while urging them to consolidate China's dominant position in the global solar market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. The visit, organized with the state's Democratic Party, will focus on economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable counties. While Newsom's advisors insist the trip is aimed at helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting issues in rural communities, the choice of location is politically significant. Newsom has made several similar overtures to Southern voters in recent years, including a high-profile debate with Florida's governor.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant breakthrough in organ cultivation by growing a human-like heart structure within a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, involved reprogramming human stem cells to improve their survival before implanting them into pig embryos. The resulting chimeric heart structure was able to develop and beat on its own for 21 days. This advancement follows the team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs and marks a critical step forward in the field of generating human organs for transplantation.</p>

          <p>A large coalition of more than 175 Democratic members of Congress is filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. The lawmakers argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or significantly downsize a federal agency created by Congress. The suit contends that measures like slashing nearly half the agency's staff and pausing billions in education funding are illegal. This legal action seeks to compel the department to fulfill its statutory obligations to students and educators across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee hike, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements. Additionally, the order calls for U.S. residents to receive "preferential treatment" in park access systems like lotteries or permitting. The move is framed as part of an "America First" approach to the nation's natural treasures and revokes an Obama-era memo promoting diversity and inclusion in parks.</p>

Speakers at a news conference warned that this places troops, who are not trained for civilian policing, in an inappropriate and dangerous position against American citizens.

According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently detained by ICE have no criminal record, a number that has nearly doubled since May. This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing on "the worst of the worst," instead showing a broad crackdown on individuals whose only offense is their immigration status. The article highlights the case of a pastor with no criminal record who was recently deported after living in the U.S. for 30 years.</p>
