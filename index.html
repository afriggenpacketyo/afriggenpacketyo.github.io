            <p>Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement between the US and Europe during Meloni's visit to Washington. Meloni hopes to bridge the gap between the EU and the US amid trade tensions and concerns about Trump's tariffs, describing her visit as a "commercial peace mission." Trump stated he was in "no rush" but expects to cut deals with every country in the near future, also hinting at a possible reduction in tariffs on China. The leaders also discussed defense spending and immigration, with Meloni aligning herself with Trump's views by criticizing "woke ideology" and championing the "war against illegal migration."</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who was mistakenly deported there by the Trump administration. Van Hollen aimed to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being, who the administration alleges is an MS-13 gang member, a claim disputed in court. Despite a federal judge and the Supreme Court ordering the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, he remains in El Salvador. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to release Mr Ábrego García and said he would remain in the country's custody. Van Hollen has been working to secure Abrego Garcia's release and ensure his rights are respected.</p>

            <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has been indicted in federal court on charges including stalking, firearms offenses, and murder through use of a firearm. Attorney General Pamela Bondi is seeking the death penalty in Mangione's case, marking the first time the federal death penalty has been sought since the Biden administration placed a moratorium on federal executions. Mangione's attorney criticized the decision as political and against the recommendation of local federal prosecutors.

            <p>The global economy is facing challenges due to escalating trade wars and policy shifts driven by the Trump administration. While statements about annexing Canada or Greenland were dismissed as rhetorical, Trump's trade policies have introduced volatility into global markets. The lack of a clear international response to these policies is concerning, raising questions about fear, complacency, or a lack of options. The article explores whether tariffs are a short-term negotiation tactic or a strategy to reverse globalization, highlighting the significant costs and potential for inflation associated with these approaches.</p>

            <p>U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has halted the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project near Long Island, citing insufficient analysis by the previous administration, raising concerns about the future of the U.S. clean-energy industry. Equinor, the project's owner, is complying with the order and suspending construction, despite having already secured federal permits and broken ground. Critics argue the decision is politically motivated, pointing to the thorough environmental review already conducted. The project was intended to supply power to 500,000 homes in New York, and its disruption threatens the state's goal of developing 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2035.</p>

            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, has been delayed until May after a contentious day in court. The hearing, intended to determine whether the brothers should receive a new sentence that could allow their release, was derailed by disputes between attorneys and prosecutors. The judge postponed the hearing to weigh requests from both sides, including a motion to recuse the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and a review of a risk assessment report.

            <p>Chinese scientists at Fudan University have unveiled "Poxiao," the fastest flash memory ever created, capable of erasing and rewriting data in 400 picoseconds. This breakthrough shatters the speed barriers of modern storage by 100,000 times, potentially revolutionizing AI computing power. The prototype currently holds only kilobytes, but its design overcomes limitations of existing storage architectures, bridging the gap between volatile and non-volatile memory. This leap in electron physics could soon blur the line between memory and computing, promising a future where AI brains can process information at unprecedented speeds.</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a funding shortfall after the government failed to provide the same level of compensation for tax increases as the police. While police forces are receiving full coverage for the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions (Nics), fire services are only receiving top-up funds that cover approximately 50% of the increase. This shortfall could equate to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine for some services.

            <p>A pilot project in Weymouth, England, called SeaCURE, has begun operating to explore the feasibility of removing carbon from seawater. The project aims to determine if extracting carbon from the sea, where it is present in greater concentrations than in the air, is a cost-effective way to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. SeaCURE processes seawater to remove carbon before pumping it back out to sea, where it absorbs more CO2. While the current project removes a small amount of CO2, proponents believe it has the potential to be scaled up significantly with renewable energy sources.</p>

            <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, stating that Powell's "termination cannot come fast enough." Trump's comments followed Powell's speech warning of potential consequences from the Trump administration's trade war. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank's rate cut and argued that the U.S. is getting rich on tariffs. Powell has defended the Fed's independence, stating that it is insulated from political influence to make decisions based on economic data.</p>

The IRS is reportedly planning to enact the president’s demand, a move that would cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. The move is part on an ongoing battle, and a significant escalation on Trump’s attack on Harvard and his aggressive, multi-pronged assault on higher education institutions. The White has urged Harvard to change its hiring, teaching and admissions practices to help fight antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>Canada is grappling with a severe housing affordability crisis, particularly in major cities like Vancouver and Toronto, where home prices have far outpaced income growth. The average home price is more than eight times the average household income. The root causes include a supply shortage and zoning laws that limit affordable housing options. Political parties are proposing solutions to increase housing construction, but some argue that addressing the wealth generated off the housing crisis is necessary.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has cancelled a plan to help Texas schools curb measles due to potential layoffs among staff working on the agency's response to the state's measles outbreak. The CDC had considered expanding a service offering onsite assessments to hospitals to schools to identify ventilation and air filtration errors contributing to the spread. The layoffs have also disrupted other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters or fungal outbreaks.</p>

            <p>A strike among bin workers in Birmingham has resulted in waste piling up across the city. The core of the dispute is the elimination of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO), who were paid more than other bin workers. The council wants to cut the crews to three by getting rid of the role of the WRCOs. The union claims this back of the lorry role is "safety critical" but the council says that "none of the roles make any specific reference to there being a lead person responsible for health and safety", as this is something all members of staff have a duty to follow.</p>
