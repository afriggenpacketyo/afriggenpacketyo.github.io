          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) social media account, Junzhengping, has issued a strong condemnation against the production and sale of building block sets depicting Japan's notorious World War II biological warfare unit, Unit 731. The PLA stated that Unit 731 symbolizes horrific crimes against humanity and represents a profound national wound, accusing merchants of distorting history by transforming bloody atrocities into assemblage "laboratories." These controversial toy sets, initially available on Chinese e-commerce platforms, have since been removed from sale following the public outcry. This incident underscores China's unwavering sensitivity regarding historical injustices, emphasizing that there is no room for opportunism or ambiguity on matters of national sentiment and historical justice, and highlights ongoing tensions over historical narratives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's health ministry has issued a nationwide warning against consuming cocktails after tainted liquor, contaminated with methanol, led to at least one confirmed death, several cases of blindness, and widespread panic. Over 120 suspected cases have been reported across multiple states and the capital, Brasília, with 11 confirmed, impacting patrons at upscale bars and restaurants. This alarming situation has prompted restaurant owners to suspend liquor sales and the health minister to announce emergency measures, including the purchase of antidotes like fomepizole and medical-grade ethanol. Federal police are actively investigating potential links to organized crime groups distributing counterfeit alcohol, which is methanol-tainted, raising significant fears of an economic hit to Brazil's vital tourism and nightlife industries as the country approaches its peak season.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Fiji is experiencing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with cases soaring from under 500 in 2014 to approximately 5,900 by 2024, prompting the health minister to declare a national crisis. The surge is primarily attributed to intravenous drug use, unsafe sexual practices, needle sharing, and a dangerous practice called "bluetoothing," where blood is shared among multiple users after a hit. Methamphetamine use, predominantly injected in Fiji, exacerbates the issue, with a significant number of new cases linked to it. Experts highlight a drastic shortage of needle-syringe programs and a lack of education, alongside increased testing, as key factors in the escalating crisis, with fears the true scale is far greater.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Donald Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's determination of "war-ravaged Portland" was "simply untethered to the facts" and likely exceeded his constitutional authority under federal law, also violating the Tenth Amendment. The judge emphasized the country's longstanding tradition of resistance to government overreach, particularly military intrusion into civil affairs, warning against blurring the line between civil and military federal power. This significant legal decision affirms the state of Oregon's sovereignty and highlights the judicial system's role in scrutinizing executive actions regarding domestic troop deployment and the nature of protests.</p>

          <p>Federal agents shot a woman in the Chicago area after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and boxed in by about 10 cars, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS initially stated the incident occurred in Broadview, near an ICE facility, but later reports from Chicago police indicated the shooting took place in Brighton Park, several miles away. The woman, who was released from the hospital, was allegedly named in an intelligence bulletin for doxxing agents and posting threats. The incident sparked tense protests, with federal agents deploying pepper balls and a military vehicle, while DHS accused Chicago police of non-cooperation amidst the confusion over jurisdiction and location.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Angelenos gathered at the 6th Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies, demanding an end to ICE raids, racial profiling, and government attacks on free speech. The "We The People Are Rising" rally, supported by unions, immigration rights organizations, and elected officials, highlighted the fear gripping migrant communities and the negative economic impact on local businesses due to perceived federal agent presence. Speakers like Councilmember Ysabel Jurado and State Sen. Maria Ladoso condemned the administration's "cruelty" and "fear" tactics, vowing to keep ICE out of schools, hospitals, and communities. The demonstration, despite its confrontational chants, maintained a generally positive atmosphere, emphasizing community solidarity and the fight for dignity.</p>

          <p>Glaciers worldwide are retreating at an alarming rate, with Switzerland's glaciers losing a quarter of their ice in the last decade, as evidenced by striking before-and-after images from space and the ground. In 2024 alone, glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica lost an astounding 450 billion tonnes of ice, a volume equivalent to 180 million Olympic swimming pools. Scientists confirm that these particularly rapid losses over the past 40 years are unequivocally linked to human-caused global warming. The article explains that even if global temperatures stabilized tomorrow, glaciers would continue to retreat due to their lagging response to climate change, threatening vital fresh water resources for hundreds of millions, especially in high mountain communities of Asia.</p>

          <p>Queuing, traditionally perceived as an inconvenience, is transforming into a desirable social and experiential activity, particularly evident in the UK. People are willingly waiting for hours, and sometimes even overnight, for events such as new store openings for Korean cosmetics or the launch of limited-edition products. Psychologists attribute this phenomenon to the "anticipation" of a reward, which triggers dopamine release in the brain, and the "exclusivity" of being among the first to experience something. Brands are actively leveraging this trend through experiential marketing, offering freebies, interactive experiences, and social media-worthy moments to deeply engage consumers. This cultural shift highlights a growing desire for community, unique in-person experiences, and the appeal of "good vibes" in an increasingly digital world.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since Bashar al-Assad's overthrow 10 months ago, but the process faces concerns over inclusivity and has seen delays in three provinces. There will be no direct popular vote; instead, "electoral colleges" select two-thirds of the 210 seats, with Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa appointing the remainder. Critics, including civil society groups, argue this setup allows the executive authority to dominate parliament, rendering elections "symbolic at best." Security concerns and the displacement of millions have led to postponements in Kurdish-controlled Raqqa and Hassakeh, and in Suweida, which recently saw deadly sectarian clashes, leaving 20 seats vacant.</p>

His six-year term begins amid significant challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including substantial membership declines and ongoing theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion.

The governor asserted there was no need for military troops, as state and local law enforcement were already coordinating public safety and protecting constitutional rights around the Broadview ICE facility. This move comes after a shooting involving federal agents in the Chicago area and Pritzker's earlier call for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against Trump.</p>

          <p>Freshers' flu," a prevalent ailment among new university students, is an assortment of common respiratory viruses that spread rapidly due to crowded living conditions and intense social interaction during the initial weeks of term. Immunologists explain that students, arriving from diverse locations, are exposed to new virus variants their immune systems haven't encountered, forcing them to build new defenses. Compounding this vulnerability, the significant stress of adapting to university life, coupled with insufficient sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all contribute to suppressing immune function. Experts advise prioritizing rest when sick, despite social pressures to participate, and seeking medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, emphasizing that the body requires adequate time to recover from these viral assaults.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has deployed hundreds of extra officers across the city to "reassure" communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack, with officers working extended shifts and rest days cancelled. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed that two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed when Jihad Al-Shamie drove a car into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue before attempting to force entry. Al-Shamie was shot dead by armed police, with one victim fatally hit by police gunfire. Four suspects remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses, as the force manages security for a Conservative Party Conference and addresses concerns about a pro-Palestine march.</p>

          <p>Two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed in a terror attack outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent, drove a car into worshippers and attempted to stab his way into the synagogue before being shot dead by armed police. Tragically, one victim, Adrian Daulby, was fatally hit by police gunfire during the incident. Police believe Al-Shamie "may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology" and had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including a recent arrest for sexual assault. Six others were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses, with four remaining in custody.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has caused significant damage and widespread disruption across large parts of the UK, bringing heavy rain and strong winds that left thousands of homes without power in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A man in his 40s also tragically died in the Republic of Ireland due to a weather-related incident. Gusts exceeding 100mph were recorded, setting a new record for the deepest area of low pressure in the UK for October, indicating an exceptionally intense weather system. The storm led to widespread closures of railway lines, roads, and all eight of London's Royal Parks, with numerous ferry services also disrupted. Engineers are now working diligently to restore power and clear affected routes as the storm gradually moves further out into the North Sea.</p>

          <p>Nearly 500 people were arrested in central London during protests organized by Defend Our Juries in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action, defying pleas from ministers and police to postpone demonstrations after the Manchester synagogue attack. The Metropolitan Police reported 488 arrests for supporting a proscribed organization, with ages ranging from 18 to 89. Despite criticism from Jewish figures and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, organizers argued that canceling the vigil would "let terror win" and expressed compassion for all victims. The Met deployed 1,500 officers, with many arrests requiring physical removal due to non-compliance, highlighting significant tensions between protest rights and public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Hearts fans are increasingly optimistic about a potential Scottish Premiership title challenge after their team's unbeaten start to the season, now five points clear at the top. Head coach Derek McInnes, while professionally cautious, acknowledges fans' excitement following a 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner at Tynecastle. The club's strong performance follows a £10 million investment from owner Tony Bloom, who had boldly predicted a challenge for second place. With rivals Rangers in turmoil and Celtic yet to hit top gear, former players like Kevin Thomson support the fans' right to "get carried away" by the team's stunning form, despite historical precedents of other teams' collapses.</p>

          <p>The annual Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach proceeded without its usual major draw, U.S. military aircraft, this year, a direct consequence of the ongoing federal government shutdown. This significant absence disappointed many attendees, including veterans, who keenly missed the powerful displays of American military might. While the British Royal Air Force and Canadian Armed Forces filled in, and historical U.S. planes like a B-29 Superfortress made impressionable appearances, the lack of current U.S. fleets was palpable. The incident underscores the tangible and often public impacts of congressional deadlock on large-scale events and national morale, even as the patriotic spirit remained strong among beachgoers. Organizers adapted, but the show highlighted the widespread consequences of government funding issues.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled a new borders plan, pledging to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election. The plan includes banning asylum claims from those entering without permission and abolishing the Immigration Tribunal, shifting appeals to Home Office officials. The party proposes rebranding the immigration enforcement unit as a "Removals Force" with doubled funding, tasked with removing 150,000 people annually, including illegal residents and foreign criminals. This policy, drawing inspiration from US President Trump's approach, also involves checking biometric data of all arrested individuals and potentially expanding detention facilities, alongside a controversial plan to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated in an interview that a Gaza peace deal is "very close," expressing his intent to finalize the 20-point plan he and Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled. Despite Trump's Friday order for Israel to "immediately" stop bombing Gaza and reports of a reduced Israeli military campaign, Gaza's civil defense agency reported continued airstrikes and shelling. Trump recounted pressuring Netanyahu, saying, "With me, you got to be fine," and credited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for aiding in Hamas's partial acceptance of the deal. The plan includes a ceasefire, hostage-prisoner exchange, Israeli withdrawal, Hamas disarmament, and a transitional government, with Trump aiming to rehabilitate Israel's global image.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Hamas to "move quickly" on the latest Gaza peace plan, warning that "all bets will be off" if there's delay, as Israeli military operations in Gaza have reportedly "significantly subsided." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the return of all remaining hostages by October 13, the end of an upcoming Jewish holiday. The White House's 20-point plan, partially accepted by Hamas, requires the immediate release of hostages within three days. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will lead negotiations in Egypt, focusing on troop positioning, humanitarian aid, and prisoner exchange, while Hamas seeks approval from other Palestinian factions for the deal.</p>
