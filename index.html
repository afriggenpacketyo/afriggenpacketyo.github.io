          <p>Russia launched its most extensive aerial assault of the war, targeting Ukraine with over 800 drones and missiles. The attack resulted in at least two fatalities and caused significant damage across multiple regions, including Kyiv. Notably, the main cabinet building in the capital sustained damage to its roof and upper floors, prompting Ukrainian leaders to call for increased international military aid and a stronger response. President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate crime aimed at prolonging the conflict.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006, is set to become the first millennial saint in the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a computer programmer who used his skills to create a website cataloging eucharistic miracles, blending modern technology with faith. His rapid canonization, attributed to two Vatican-recognized miracles, has inspired a global following, with his tomb in Assisi becoming a major pilgrimage site. The event highlights the Church's effort to connect with a younger, digital-native generation.</p>

          <p>Following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn, Anutin Charnvirakul has officially assumed office as the new prime minister of Thailand. His appointment comes after the ousting of former Prime Minister Paetongtam Shinawatra by a court order, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Anutin, known for championing cannabis decriminalization, secured the position with support from the opposition People's Party. He has committed to dissolving parliament and calling for new elections within four months as a condition of their backing.</p>

Now 41, Rodgers will be playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers in a week one matchup against the Jets, the team that recently released him. The article reflects on the immense hype and subsequent disappointment of his brief tenure in New York, which failed to end the team's long-standing playoff drought. The game is framed as an opportunity for closure for Rodgers, the Jets, and their respective fanbases.</p>

          <p>The US Open has transformed from a traditional tennis tournament into a large-scale cultural event, prioritizing consumption, celebrity appearances, and social media presence. This shift, described as the "Coachella-fication" of the tournament, is marked by high-priced themed cocktails, influencer marketing, and even an in-house dating show. The article argues that the spectacle of attendance and branding has become as central to the experience as the tennis itself. This evolution reflects a broader trend in modern sports where capturing the attention economy is paramount for success and growth.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have initiated a five-day strike, causing significant disruption to the city's transport network. The rolling industrial action is centered on demands for a pay increase and a reduced 32-hour work week to address fatigue management. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay raise but deems the requested reduction in hours unaffordable. This marks the first major Tube strike to affect the entire network since March 2023, with limited or no service expected on most lines until Friday morning.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. He is accused of planting two bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with attacks claimed by an animal rights extremist group. After evading a 65-mile police chase and disappearing in 2003, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales last year.

These suicide drones reportedly have a range of at least 1,000km, making them capable of striking deep into mainland China.

The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility will vary across the country, with eastern regions getting the best and longest view as the Moon rises. Astronomers advise finding a clear view of the horizon to witness the event, which is the last total lunar eclipse visible from the UK until August 2026.</p>

It cites examples such as India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron, whose relationships with Trump soured despite initial efforts at friendship. The author specifically warns UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer against his current approach ahead of Trump's state visit, arguing it yields few benefits while damaging Britain's reputation. The piece concludes that resistance and firmness, rather than appeasement, are more effective strategies when dealing with Trump's transactional and personal approach to foreign policy.</p>

The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they release a powerful force capable of propelling millimeter-scale objects high into the air. This technique offers precise control over the launch and could be applied to robotics and material transport.</p>

The Orioles scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth, capped by a walk-off single, handing the spiraling Dodgers one of their most painful losses of the season.</p>
