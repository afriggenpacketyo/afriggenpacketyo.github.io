          <p>This article, written by AI and democracy researchers, highlights long-term risks that artificial intelligence poses to democratic governance, extending beyond immediate concerns about deepfakes in elections. It identifies three key trends: AI's potential to replace direct communication between elected officials and constituents, the concentration of wealth and power among AI controllers leading to democratic erosion, and the transformation of the information landscape away from fact-based media. The authors advocate for strong political will to implement policy solutions and address these insidious threats over decades. This article emphasizes the need for cautious AI development.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of National Guard troops remain in the Chicago area as city and Illinois officials await a judge's ruling on the legality of their deployment. President Trump ordered the mobilization as part of an immigration enforcement crackdown and in response to unsubstantiated claims of rising crime, though the stated mission is to protect federal assets. The article highlights Governor JB Pritzker's criticism of the federal government's lack of communication regarding troop movements. Critics, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, view the deployment as an authoritarian move that threatens constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of striking a boat carrying Colombian citizens in the Caribbean, an allegation the White House swiftly dismissed as 'baseless.' The U.S. has conducted multiple strikes against vessels it claims are involved in 'narco-trafficking' off Venezuela, resulting in 21 deaths and raising concerns about breaches of international law. The article highlights growing tensions and a new 'war scenario' in the Caribbean, with the U.S. Senate recently rejecting a measure to limit Trump's military force in such operations.

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydro, have collectively outpaced coal as the leading global source of electricity during the first half of 2025. A report by the energy think tank Ember indicates that renewable electricity comprised 34.3% of global consumption, while coal fell to 33.1%. Developing nations like China and India spearheaded this transition, though some Western countries increased coal use. The article notes a slight decrease in global carbon dioxide emissions, but rising electricity demand, partly driven by AI, presents ongoing challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is emerging as a potential treatment for severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among first responders, a population highly exposed to trauma. The article highlights initial research suggesting ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects, though more studies are needed for its role in PTSD. Despite its promise, the treatment faces hurdles including a largely unregulated market, varying state oversight, and limited insurance coverage, making it costly. Some individuals, like Waynesville Police Sgt. Paige Shell, have reported significant improvements in managing stress and mood after undergoing sessions.

          <p>A new poll indicates a significant politicization of public health beliefs, with 59% of Americans disapproving of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s performance as Health Secretary.

The article highlights a sharp decline in public trust in the CDC, particularly among Democrats, amidst the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle its mandates.

          <p>A $6 million federal grant for the PediaFlow, an implantable artificial heart for infants, developed by Cornell biomedical engineer James Antaki, has been canceled by the Trump administration. This cut is part of broader funding withdrawals from elite universities, purportedly due to civil rights violations and antisemitism concerns on campus. The article highlights the direct impact on children like 4-year-old Caleb, who is in heart failure awaiting a transplant, and the broader chilling effect on critical medical research.
