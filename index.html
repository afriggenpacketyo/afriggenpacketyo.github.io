          <p>An ABC television station in Sacramento was hit by gunfire in what police are investigating as a drive-by shooting. While no injuries were reported, the building was struck by at least three rounds. A 64-year-old suspect was arrested by local police and later taken into federal custody by the FBI on charges related to interfering with a communications station. The motive remains under investigation, and the incident has been condemned by officials as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's calls to prosecute his political rivals and actions against media critics, senior Democrats like Chuck Schumer have voiced alarm. They argue that using government agencies such as the DOJ and FCC to target opponents is a step towards authoritarianism and a "banana republic." The criticism highlights a growing concern over the erosion of democratic norms under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Protests took place across all 26 states of Brazil against a legislative proposal that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted of attempting a coup. The demonstrations were fueled by a bill, fast-tracked by right-wing lawmakers, that would pardon those involved in the January 2023 uprising. Prominent artists and cultural figures helped organize the protests, urging the public to reject what they see as an attempt to shield politicians from accountability.</p>

          <p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, a 46-year-old engineer and workers' rights activist, has been sentenced to death for a third time in Iran on charges of "armed rebellion against the state."

Human rights organizations and international trade unions have condemned the verdict, citing serious procedural flaws and calling it a politically motivated trial designed to suppress civil activity and spread fear among labor movements.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration shut down an investigation into "border czar" Tom Homan that was initiated during the prior administration. The probe reportedly involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was recorded allegedly accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking future government contracts. Officials in the current administration confirmed the probe's existence but stated it was closed after a review found "no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing."</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director and current IBM vice chair, stated that the U.S. job market has degraded, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. He pointed to a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 per month, attributing it to companies cutting labor costs to protect margins amid rising input costs. This shift from "labor hoarding" post-COVID to aggressive expense management is now clearly showing up in economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss concerns over new, restrictive Pentagon rules that require journalists to get official approval before releasing any information, even if it is unclassified. When asked about the directive, Trump stated, "Nothing stops reporters." The policy, implemented by the Department of War, has been heavily criticized by press freedom advocates as a form of prior restraint and a direct assault on independent journalism covering the U.S. military.</p>
