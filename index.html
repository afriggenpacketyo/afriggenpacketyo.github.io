        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that had struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, providing the administration with some breathing room as it prepares to argue that the law empowers the president to unilaterally launch a global tariff regime. The Trump administration had told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that it would seek "emergency relief" from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on pause. The lower court had invalidated all of Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and other duties, finding that the 1970s-era law Trump invoked did not "confer such unbounded authority" to presidents. The pause gives the administration time to prepare its arguments. </p>

The Department of Justice has requested a delay in a ruling that President Trump does not have the authority to impose "reciprocal" tariffs on virtually every nation, contending it will cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and strip the president of leverage in trade negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the administration will work to "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities as the administration's dispute with Harvard continues to escalate. </p>

          <p>For those who have yet to file their 2024 tax return, it is crucial to address several key questions to mitigate potential penalties and interest. It's important to determine if a tax extension was filed, understand the amount owed and explore payment options if unable to pay immediately, and ensure all necessary documents are available to file accurately. The article also advises on assessing the risk of IRS penalties or enforcement action and considering whether working with a tax professional could simplify the process and reduce long-term costs. Filing, even late, opens the door to payment plans and penalty relief. (not investment advice) </p>

Tactics include deputizing state and local law enforcement and arresting people at locations once considered protected, such as courthouses. This aggressive approach has led to citizens being caught in the dragnet, due process concerns, and overcrowding in detention centers.

          <p>The resumption of student loan payments is negatively impacting many borrowers' credit scores, with millions experiencing significant drops in their credit records. This makes securing future loans more difficult and costly, potentially delaying milestones like buying a home or saving for retirement. The end of the 12-month "on ramp" period, during which missed payments were not reported to credit bureaus, has led to newly delinquent borrowers' credit scores being affected. Experts warn of long-lasting consequences, including lower credit limits and higher interest rates. (not investment advice) </p>

The suit also highlights a spate of deaths in the county jails in 2022 and an ongoing investigation by the California Attorney General into jail conditions. </p>
