        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Julie Bowen recently revealed that she has had a pacemaker since she was 29 years old due to a heart rhythm disorder called sick sinus syndrome. The "Modern Family" star explained on a podcast that her resting heart rate was dangerously low, often in the 30s, before the device was implanted. Her sister, who was in medical school at the time, first noticed the abnormality and urged her to see a cardiologist. Bowen realized the pacemaker was necessary to prevent her from passing out, potentially while driving.</p>

          <p>A massive search and rescue operation is underway in central Texas following devastating flash floods that have killed at least 32 people, including 14 children. The Guadalupe River surged over 26 feet in under an hour, catching many residents and campers asleep. Authorities report that 27 children from a Christian youth camp are still missing, and with more rain forecasted, the region remains on high alert for further flooding. Governor Greg Abbott has expanded the disaster declaration to support the ongoing efforts to locate all victims of the event.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has announced his official resignation from Congress, effective July 20. This move further reduces the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212, potentially complicating Speaker Mike Johnson's legislative agenda. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public service to start a private business focused on helping America compete against the Chinese Communist Party. His departure presents another challenge for the House GOP leadership in managing their narrow control of the chamber.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to continue in Qatar, although Israel has deemed Hamas's proposed changes to the deal "unacceptable." This development comes amid ongoing violence, including an attack on a U.S.-backed aid distribution site in Khan Younis that injured two American workers. Separately, Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people in Gaza, including a doctor and his children, while others were killed seeking food aid. The continued bloodshed underscores the urgent need for a resolution as the war approaches its 21st month.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order from President Donald Trump aims to curb the influence of Chinese drone manufacturers in the global market, continuing Washington's efforts to challenge Beijing's industry leadership. However, analysts and industry insiders note that China's dominant position makes its products difficult to remove from global supply chains. American firms that rely on drones for commercial purposes express concern that a ban could significantly raise costs, as there are few non-Chinese alternatives available. The move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic in the broader US-China economic competition.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for an email claiming President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the message as "blatant misinformation" and a partisan political statement. The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, phased-out tax deduction for seniors. Opponents argue the communication is misleading and politicizes a historically apolitical agency, causing confusion among beneficiaries about the actual impact of the legislation.

US authorities informed Calderano, who also holds a Portuguese passport, that he was no longer eligible for the visa waiver program because he had competed in Cuba in 2023 for Olympic qualifiers. His attempt to secure an emergency visa was unsuccessful, causing him to miss one of the season's most important events. The incident raises concerns for international athletes, especially with the US set to host major future events.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, the autobiography of celebrated American author Mark Twain has been published 100 years after his death in 1910. The work, which Twain dictated over several years, was intentionally embargoed to allow him to speak freely without fear of hurting those he knew. The unconventional memoir is not a linear narrative but rather a collection of his thoughts on various subjects, including candid and often critical opinions on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt. This long-awaited publication offers an unfiltered look into the mind of one of America's most iconic literary figures.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris anticipates a highly competitive British Grand Prix, suggesting that six cars from three different teams have a realistic chance of winning. Qualifying was extremely close, with the top six drivers from Red Bull, McLaren, and Ferrari separated by less than a quarter of a second. The teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while Ferrari and McLaren focus more on cornering performance. This strategic variation, combined with the potential for rain, sets the stage for an exciting and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

The demonstrators were gathered to show support for Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. This designation makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government banned the group following a history of criminal damage, including a recent incident at an RAF base.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire, located in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, has grown to become California's largest wildfire of the year, scorching nearly 80,000 acres. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, has forced over 200 people to evacuate and threatens about 50 structures. A major concern is the fire's proximity to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, a habitat for several endangered species. With a heat wave expected in Southern California, concerns are rising about the potential for the fire to spread further, as over 600 personnel work to contain it.</p>
