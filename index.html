          <h2>Trump Announces 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Made Movies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S., citing a dying American film industry and unfair foreign incentives. He claims this is a matter of national security due to messaging and propaganda. The move follows earlier trade actions, including tariffs on China, which have already impacted Hollywood's access to the Chinese market. Industry experts fear retaliation could devastate the U.S. film industry, while the Commerce Secretary indicated support for the President's plan.</p>
