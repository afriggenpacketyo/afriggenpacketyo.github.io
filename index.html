          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is eliminating its Office of Research and Development, a move expected to impact over 1,500 scientists and researchers. The agency states this will save nearly $750 million and is part of a broader workforce reduction that has cut staff by 22% under the Trump administration. Critics, including former EPA officials, warn that dismantling this respected research body is dangerous and will shift environmental health costs to the public, undermining protections against pollutants like "forever chemicals" and factors contributing to asthma. Employees reportedly learned of the decision through public press releases, creating widespread uncertainty about their futures.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail. The incident, which marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, occurred while the deputies were reportedly working to render safe a grenade recovered a day earlier. Sheriff Robert Luna stated that the investigation is in its early stages, emphasizing that there is much that remains unknown about the cause of the tragic blast. Federal agencies including the ATF and FBI are assisting in the investigation, and officials have confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the community.</p>

          <p>Beijing is highlighting a failed tourism project in Gongcheng county as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City," intended as a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after its capital chain broke and local officials made poor decisions. Initially budgeted for 1.65 billion yuan, only a fraction was spent, leaving multiple buildings derelict and representing a "severe waste of resources," according to China's disciplinary commission. The case is being used as a cautionary tale for other local officials across the country to avoid unrealistic and poorly planned development projects.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, first seen on a ship in 2018, is limited by the weight of projectiles it can fire, making it less effective for sinking ships. The new design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would increase bore pressure and allow it to launch heavier, 30kg shells at speeds of Mach 7. Researchers state this advancement is necessary to overcome the current weapon's power limitations and enhance its military application.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency reports that serious water pollution incidents in England increased by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. There were 75 incidents posing "serious or persistent" harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A cross-party committee of MPs has labeled the situation "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action" in holding water companies accountable for underinvestment and failing infrastructure. The report comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, with recommendations expected to address these deep-rooted systemic failures.</p>

This follows President Vladimir Putin's directive to restrict software from "unfriendly countries" and promote a state-backed alternative messaging app called MAX. Russia has already banned Facebook and Instagram and is seeking to establish "digital sovereignty" by reducing its reliance on foreign technology platforms.

Trump accused the Fed of "choking out the housing market" with high interest rates and also alleged mismanagement of the Federal Reserve headquarters' renovation. In a letter, Powell defended the renovation project, stating it is carefully overseen and challenging the administration's characterizations of its features, such as "VIP dining rooms."

          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing. With a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, the agency has struggled to conduct proper inspections and address workplace hazards, sometimes closing cases without on-site visits. The audit found that even when inspections occurred, documentation was often poor, and fines were sometimes improperly reduced. Labor advocates argue this chronic understaffing puts California's 19 million workers at risk, especially as the agency's duties expand to address climate-related dangers like extreme heat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government will soon require most foreign visitors to pay a new, non-waivable "$250 visa integrity fee" under the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students needing nonimmigrant visas. The provision states that travelers can be reimbursed if they comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, travel industry groups and immigration lawyers have noted a lack of clarity on how the fee will be collected and reimbursed, creating significant uncertainty for future travelers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. In a memo, Dr. Sean Barbabella described the condition as "benign and common," especially in people over 70, and confirmed that tests found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and wearing compression stockings, with the doctor declaring the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge has ordered state officials to deactivate an inmate's implanted heart-regulating device just before his scheduled execution on August 5. The ruling addresses concerns from attorneys for death-row inmate Byron Black, who argued the device could repeatedly and painfully shock him as the lethal injection drug stops his heart. The order requires a certified technician to be present to disable the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator moments before the execution. The state, which had argued the inmate would be unconscious and unable to feel pain, is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>At the direction of President Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested that a federal court unseal grand jury transcripts from the sex trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein. The move comes amid a political firestorm over the administration's handling of the Epstein files, intensified by a recent news report about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein. The DOJ's filing argues for the release due to public interest and also seeks to unseal transcripts from the related case against Ghislaine Maxwell. A judge will ultimately decide if and when the materials can be released, a process that will likely involve lengthy reviews and redactions.</p>

The case has raised questions about the justice system, as Gaddis had been released from custody on two separate violent crime charges within the past year.

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK report that this summer is shaping up to be a "good year for wasps," with populations seemingly thriving. The increase is likely due to the very warm and dry spring, which created ideal breeding conditions for the insects. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers that help maintain balance in gardens and wild landscapes. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid swatting at the insects and can distract them by leaving a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas.</p>

This obsession has created a political challenge for Donald Trump, as his base demands the release of all government files on the matter.

          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research, published in Science Immunology, found that in people with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a molecule produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The discovery opens the door to developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway, potentially improving outcomes for many sufferers.</p>
