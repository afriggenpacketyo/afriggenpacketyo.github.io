          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have voiced their support for the attacks and reiterated their calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. Reza Pahlavi, son of the former Shah, stated the strikes were a result of the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people, while Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, said Khamenei must go and is responsible for a costly and unpatriotic project. Rajavi advocated for a free, democratic, and non-nuclear Iran with separation of religion and state. The statements highlight the internal opposition to the current Iranian government amidst escalating international tensions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear sites has sparked international reactions, with fears of a broader regional conflict escalating. Israeli leaders lauded the U.S. strikes, with Prime Minister Netanyahu praising President Trump's strength, while Iranian officials vowed regrettable responses and accused the U.S. of violating the UN Charter. UN Secretary General Guterres expressed grave alarm, urging de-escalation and diplomacy, while allies of Iran, such as Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the "American aggression" and pledged to join in retaliation. The responses underscore the complex geopolitical landscape and the potential for further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has cautioned about the potential for escalation beyond the Middle East following U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear sites, advocating for a return to negotiations. Starmer reassured the British public that efforts are underway to stabilize the situation and find a diplomatic resolution after the U.S. strikes on three sites. While the UK was informed in advance, it was not involved in the U.S. action, and Israeli President Herzog stated that Iran's nuclear program had been hit "substantially".

          <p>The UK government is organizing a chartered flight to evacuate British nationals from Israel next week, prioritizing vulnerable individuals and their dependents.

Further flights will depend on demand and security, but the situation's volatility means plans could change quickly.

          <p>An analysis of historical resistance to Nazism offers insights for the US left, emphasizing the importance of focused action over mere broadcasting of opinions. The German activist Emmi Bonhoeffer's support group for Holocaust survivors exemplifies effective resistance by creating tangible change without seeking attention. The author argues that the US left's judgmental streak and failure to empathize with Trump supporters hinders its effectiveness. The key to resisting far-right extremism lies in creating a better future for everyone, including those who have been misled, and embracing shared humanity.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that despite the United States' direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, its long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific will remain unchanged. While the U.S. has redeployed forces to address the conflict, including temporarily shifting assets away from the Indo-Pacific, it has repeatedly pledged to prioritize strategic resources on China. Observers note that the decision to strike Iran expands U.S. military engagement in the Middle East, but Washington's commitment to the Indo-Pacific remains steadfast. The redeployment of the USS Nimitz prompted caution from Taiwan, which relies heavily on the U.S. military presence in the region.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are expanding their brand beyond Los Angeles, aiming to become "the world's team" through the NFLâ€™s Global Markets Program. The Rams have been granted rights in Mexico, China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, and will be the home team for the first NFL regular-season game in Australia in 2026. The team is sending ambassadors abroad and engaging with fans through various initiatives, with the goal of increasing accessibility and creating new fans internationally. The Rams are leveraging Los Angeles's position as a gateway to the United States for Australians, giving them a marketing advantage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing concern in Colorado's San Luis Valley, where the program is a lifeline for healthcare. The region's hospital, San Luis Valley Health, relies on Medicaid for nearly a third of its $140 million budget, and cuts could force difficult decisions. Many residents depend on Medicaid for access to healthcare, including low-income seniors, people with disabilities, and working-age adults. The potential cuts could impact critical services like cancer and maternity care, and negatively affect the local economy, as the hospital is the valley's largest employer.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey and the Liberal Democrats are proposing a Â£10,000 bonus for new army recruits and a Â£20,000 payment for former personnel who re-enlist, aiming to increase the number of trained soldiers. The plan also includes distributing pamphlets to every British home to prepare citizens for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The Lib Dems claim the initiative would urgently boost troop numbers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000, and the Â£60 million cost would be covered by the main defence budget. This proposal is part of a broader effort to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.</p>
