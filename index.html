          <p>Prime Minister Ishigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is projected to experience historically low results in the upcoming Tokyo assembly election, which is viewed as a significant indicator for the July House of Councillors race, as Ishiba navigates leading a minority government amid national political challenges. Tomin First no Kai, established by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, is expected to emerge as the dominant force in the 127-member assembly, propelled by its emphasis on enhancing quality of life. The election results are closely watched for their potential impact on the national political landscape, particularly concerning leadership and economic policy. The number of registered voters stood at approximately 11.55 million for this key election.</p>

          <p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton stated that the U.S. must prepare for potential Iranian retaliation following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, emphasizing the safety of Americans as President Trump's top priority. Cotton echoed Trump's warning to Iran, stating that any targeting of Americans would result in severe consequences, and clarified that the U.S. is not seeking regime change but aims to eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons program. While a full damage assessment is underway, Cotton believes that the strikes have severely damaged Iran's critical nuclear infrastructure, urging Iranian leaders to heed President Trump's warning and pursue peace. The senator did not rule out any potential targets in the event of Iranian retaliation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced successful U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, coordinated with Israel, while Iranian officials confirmed the strikes but downplayed the damage. The U.S. military operation, dubbed "Midnight Hammer," involved 125 aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, and Tomahawk cruise missiles targeting the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan facilities. The Fordo site was struck with GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, also known as "bunker buster" bombs, due to its depth underground. Iran launched missiles towards Tel Aviv and Haifa within hours of the US bombing, resulting in injuries, and Iran's Foreign Minister condemned the US strike, reserving Iran's right to respond.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, characterized President Trump's strikes on Iran as a "massive gamble," noting that the full impact on Iran's nuclear program is still uncertain. Himes expressed concern over the lack of Congressional approval for the strikes, emphasizing Congress's sole authority to declare war. While acknowledging a small chance of a best-case scenario, Himes cautioned that historical precedent suggests U.S. military involvements in the region often lead to worst-case scenarios, such as increased regional instability or the Iranians successfully developing nuclear weapons. He also said that he was "disturbed" by the fact that the strikes were undertaken without the approval of Congress, which holds the sole authority to declare war.</p>

          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats are suggesting impeachment proceedings against President Trump for launching a military strike on Iran without Congressional authorization. Ocasio-Cortez stated that Trump's decision to bomb Iran without approval constitutes a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers, risking a prolonged war. Representative Sean Casten argued that the president's actions represent an unambiguous impeachable offense, highlighting that no president can bomb another country that doesn't pose an imminent threat to the U.S. without Congressional consent. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated that the president had "failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East."</p>

While not directly confirming the complete destruction of Iran's nuclear facilities, Vance expressed confidence that the U.S. has significantly hindered the program and is prepared to respond with overwhelming force if Iran retaliates. Vance emphasized that the Trump administration is not seeking regime change in Iran, but rather the elimination of its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>America’s recent attacks on Iran have intensified ongoing discussions in Tehran about the country's future and the leadership of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prior to the U.S. intervention, a group of Iranian figures had initiated a plan for governing Iran without Khamenei, potentially through a leadership committee that would negotiate with the U.S. The sources conveyed their hope that the exposure could help them gauge regional and international response.

Schwarzenegger, who comes from a famous family, also addresses the issue of nepotism and his desire to forge his own path in acting.

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher despite the United States entering the war between Israel and Iran and striking three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high on bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict with Tehran would help it to come to an end, despite the Iranian Foreign Minister's insistence that the country could not return to diplomacy "while under attack." Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have all released statements in the last 24 hours, the UAE urged an immediate halt to escalation to "avoid serious repercussions" in the region, while Saudi Arabia expressed concern and Qatar said it "deplored deterioration" in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

          <p>A bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin notes the potential for low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and warns that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists. U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots in the U.S. since 2020, and the likelihood of violence from extremists in response to the conflict is increased. The advisory recommends heightened vigilance and awareness of potential threats.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine revealed that the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved decoy bombers and "misdirection" to maintain secrecy. B-2 stealth bombers were deployed over the Pacific as a diversion, while the actual bombers flew under the cover of darkness, refueling multiple times in flight. The mission, known to only a few people, relied on operational security to ensure its success. The attack involved bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles, with Iran not deploying fighters or surface-to-air missiles during the operation.</p>

          <p>The author argues that President Trump's decision to attack Iran without Congressional approval undermines American democracy by depriving citizens of representation and accountability. Drawing a contrast with the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, the author highlights how a congressional vote enables public education, participation, and the ability to hold elected officials responsible. The author expresses concern that the trend of bypassing Congress on matters of war is dangerous, potentially leading to radicalization if citizens lack official channels to effect change. The trend of denying the public democratic channels to oppose war isn’t merely anathema to a self-governing republic; it is dangerous.</p>

          <p>According to Reem Raouda, there are five phrases that instantly make children not want to listen, and what to say instead. Traditional parenting phrases such as “Because I said so” and “If you don’t listen, you’ll lose [X privilege]” often trigger a child’s fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. By shifting to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, cooperation becomes natural. The real secret to getting kids to listen is not about controlling a child's behavior, but creating the conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>
