          <p>England rugby star Megan Jones is pursuing World Cup glory while navigating profound personal grief, having lost both parents within four months. Her mother, Paula, struggled with alcoholism and died in December, following her father Simon's death from lung cancer in August. Jones, who previously worked as an Amazon delivery driver when her rugby contract was frozen, finds solace and fearlessness on the pitch. Now a patron for an addiction charity, her stellar performance is fueled by a bitter perspective, transforming her immense loss into a powerful drive to excel in her sport.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the successful recovery of nearly £500 million in fraudulent funds over the past year, largely attributed to a new artificial intelligence tool. This significant sum, marking the largest annual recovery by government anti-fraud teams, includes substantial amounts linked to Covid-19 pandemic schemes, as well as unlawful council tax and illegal social housing claims. The innovative AI tool, known as the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, is now slated for international licensing, with countries like the US and Australia expected to adopt it. Despite civil liberties concerns regarding AI deployment, the government champions these savings for reinvesting in vital public services.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a colossal $850 billion infrastructure expansion, collaborating with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank to establish a 17-gigawatt supercomputing network across the U.S. This unprecedented investment, comparable to the energy output of 17 nuclear plants, is deemed essential to meet the skyrocketing demand for AI, evidenced by a tenfold surge in ChatGPT usage. Altman addressed concerns about the massive spending, emphasizing its necessity for maximizing AI capabilities and highlighting nuclear power as a vital energy source. While critics warn of a potential bubble and circular financing, Altman expressed strong confidence in the technology's long-term societal benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a commanding performance in his final regular-season pitching start, silencing the Arizona Diamondbacks over a season-high six innings. The two-way star, recovering from a second Tommy John surgery, demonstrated an elite fastball and efficient pitching, concluding the regular season with an impressive 2.87 ERA. Despite Ohtani's dominance, the Dodgers' bullpen, including rookies and closer Tanner Scott, squandered a 4-0 lead, ultimately resulting in a walk-off loss. This article emphasizes Ohtani's readiness for his inaugural postseason pitching outing, while also highlighting the team's ongoing struggles with bullpen consistency as playoffs loom.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has imposed a 15-year prison sentence on Park Soon-kwan, the chief executive of lithium battery manufacturer Aricell, following a catastrophic fire at his Hwaseong plant. The blaze tragically killed 23 people, including 18 foreign workers, and injured eight others. The court concluded that the fire was an "anticipated disaster," holding Park and other executives accountable for the fatalities due to insufficient safety protocols and inadequate worker training. This ruling represents the longest jail term ever issued under South Korea's industrial safety law, signaling a heightened commitment to punishing corporate negligence in fatal workplace incidents.</p>

          <p>One year after a devastating war with Israel and the loss of its leader, Hezbollah demonstrates surprising financial resilience, continuing to pay fighters and fund social services. Despite mounting pressure to disarm and US efforts to cripple its finances, the Iran-backed movement reportedly receives $60 million monthly. Fighters earn above Lebanon's minimum wage, and families of "martyrs" receive stipends. While Beirut has tightened scrutiny of the group's finances and Syrian supply routes were disrupted, experts note Hezbollah's reliance on a network of companies, businessmen, and cash flows from abroad, allowing it to maintain its extensive social infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A controversial bronze statue, portraying Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein in a seemingly jovial pose, has been erected on the east end of the National Mall. The artwork features a plaque that explicitly references their "long-lasting bond" and includes excerpts from an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein. This installation, permitted to remain until Sunday, aligns thematically with previous art pieces critical of the former president. Its presence notably resurfaces public scrutiny of Trump's past association with the convicted sexual assaulter, an issue that has persistently challenged his public image and caused internal fissures within his political base.</p>

          <p>A Canadian investigation has determined that TikTok's safeguards for preventing underage access and protecting children's personal data are insufficient. The probe revealed that despite the app's stated age restriction of 13, hundreds of thousands of Canadian children use the platform annually, leading to the collection of sensitive personal information for online marketing. Canada's privacy commissioner, Philippe Dufresne, underscored the potential for harmful impacts on youth due to this extensive data collection. While TikTok disputes certain findings, it has committed to introducing new measures to enhance its platform's safety for Canadian users, amid ongoing international scrutiny of the app's data practices and user impact.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly articulated a significant shift in his stance on the conflict in Ukraine, now asserting that Kyiv possesses the capability to "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." This declaration, made on his Truth Social platform, posits that Russia's current economic difficulties, coupled with sustained support from Europe and NATO, could facilitate Ukraine's full territorial recovery. The unexpected remarks, following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly, mark a departure from Trump's prior suggestions of potential territorial concessions.

          <p>Multiple U.S. citizens and a green card holder have initiated legal claims against the U.S. government, alleging wrongful detention, racial profiling, and abuse by federal immigration agents. Among the plaintiffs, Cary Lopez Alvarado, a pregnant Los Angeles native, was reportedly handcuffed and detained for over eight hours, giving birth to her daughter soon after her release. Another claimant, Juan Rivas, asserts he was physically assaulted despite possessing legal documentation. Their attorney, Michael Carrillo, cautions that a recent Supreme Court ruling could exacerbate the risk for citizens, advising them to carry identification.

          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust faces a mandate to repay nearly £5 million, having erroneously claimed compliance with safe maternity care standards. This repayment stems from an investigation by NHS Resolution, which found the trust failed to meet all 10 safety measures required by the Maternity Incentive Scheme, a program designed to incentivize quality care. The article reports that the incident follows a damning Care Quality Commission report rating the trust's maternity services as inadequate and exposing women and babies to "significant risk." This situation underscores persistent systemic issues within NHS maternity care and raises serious questions about the reliability of self-reporting mechanisms in healthcare.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has broadened its recall of frozen shrimp products for the sixth time in just over a month, citing potential contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. Seattle-based AquaStar is the latest firm to withdraw various shrimp products from grocery stores across 31 states. Although no consumer illnesses have been reported, the investigation commenced after U.S. Customs and Border Protection detected Cesium-137 in an imported shipment. Food experts emphasize that such frequent recalls for radioactive contamination are uncommon, suggesting that the FDA's food safety inspection program is effectively identifying and preventing potentially unsafe products from reaching the public.</p>
