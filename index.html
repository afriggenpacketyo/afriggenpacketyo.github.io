          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the country's nuclear program and military commanders, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. The strikes, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, aimed to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, with Prime Minister Netanyahu stating Iran was taking steps to weaponize enriched uranium. Iran responded by launching drones toward Israel, which were reportedly intercepted, while international reactions varied from condemnation to calls for de-escalation. The strikes have serious implications for nuclear safety, security, and regional and international peace.</p>

          <p>Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya has strongly condemned Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, citing concerns over escalating tensions in the region. Iwaya emphasized the regret that Israel took military action despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran for a peaceful resolution, urging all parties to exercise utmost restraint. Japan, heavily reliant on crude oil imports from the Middle East, has traditionally maintained friendly relations with both Iran and Israel, while closely monitoring retaliatory actions and ensuring the safety of its nationals in the region.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning has commenced for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining a key factor.

Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, particularly unaffiliated ones, while major issues at stake include rising living costs, political funding scandals, and regional concerns.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli attacks on Iran, questions arise about which nuclear sites were targeted and their significance. Iran has spread its nuclear facilities across multiple sites, some in underground bunkers, making complete destruction difficult. Key facilities include Natanz, the main uranium enrichment center; Isfahan, a uranium processing plant; and Fordow, a fuel enrichment plant located in a mountain. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that the Natanz facility was among the targets in recent Israeli strikes, but no radiation leaks have been detected.</p>

The measures seek to establish an elite research environment in Japan, focusing on fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The government plans to utilize profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support universities in producing internationally competitive research, with efforts to raise salaries and reduce administrative burdens for researchers.</p>

          <p>According to DW's Iran expert Theresa Tropper, Israeli strikes on Iran targeted areas in Tehran inhabited by wealthier citizens, potentially including senior officials and nuclear scientists. Tropper suggests that while some Iranians may not mourn the deaths of military commanders, attacks on residential areas killing fellow Iranians could evoke a different response. She highlights the vulnerability of Iranians, noting the government's poor track record in protecting its citizens and the absence of strong air defenses or regional allies.</p>

          <p>Canada's newly elected Mark Carney government is facing criticism for tabling a border bill that aligns with U.S. policies, granting law enforcement sweeping powers to obtain citizen data and aligning with U.S. refugee policies. Bill C-2, or the Strong Borders Act, changes the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, granting the minister extensive powers to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake. Critics argue the bill infringes on due process, disproportionately affects women, racialized claimants, and LGBTQ claimants, while also creating a surveillance state with enhanced powers for law enforcement to access citizens' data.</p>

          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, Northern Ireland experienced disorder, with Portadown witnessing a crowd throwing bricks and masonry at police, though at a lower intensity than previous days. The unrest, which began in Ballymena, has resulted in 41 injured officers and 15 arrests, stemming from a protest over an alleged sexual assault. Police issued warnings and maintained a heavy presence, while community leaders called for calm. The violence has prompted families to hide in attics and wardrobes, with authorities condemning the actions as racist and targeting ethnic minorities.</p>

          <p>Iran and Israel have been adversaries for decades, but they were allies until Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. The shift occurred as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and sought regional influence. The relationship deteriorated further when Israel intervened in Lebanon's civil war, leading Iran to support Shiite militias, including Hezbollah. Despite some voices within Iran questioning the country's anti-Israel stance, the current leadership remains antagonistic, denying the Holocaust and supporting groups hostile to Israel.</p>

State media asserts the ship has been fully restored, though experts question the completeness of the repairs given the rapid relaunch. The warship, one of two new destroyers built by North Korea, is capable of launching nuclear weapons and is part of Kim's effort to develop a nuclear-armed navy.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu declared Israel would continue attacking Iran to eliminate its nuclear program, claiming Iran was close to assembling nuclear weapons. Israel has been contemplating such an attack for two decades, and the decision to act now stems from the belief that Iran's leaders had decided a nuclear bomb was worth the risk. Israel's actions in piercing Iran's immunity, attacking its soldiers abroad, and targeting its own territory led to the erosion of Iran's deterrent power, making it necessary for Iran to achieve real nuclear statehood to recover its position. The attacks carry obvious risks, but these risks are less if Iran is at its weakest.</p>
