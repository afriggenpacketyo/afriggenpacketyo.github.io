The filing comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen its most active year since 2021, driven by investor interest in technology and AI firms. Navan aims to disrupt the business travel sector with its all-in-one app that integrates AI to streamline booking and expense reporting.</p>

          <p>The Irish-language hip-hop group Kneecap has been banned from performing in Canada due to controversial political statements and terror-related charges against one member in the UK. Canadian officials cited the group's alleged support for terrorist organizations as contrary to national values, a move praised by some Jewish advocacy groups. The band, which denies the allegations and calls the ban malicious, is now pursuing legal action while also facing the cancellation of its US tour over similar issues. This controversy follows a pattern of political expression by the group, which has previously drawn criticism for its pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 4,000 Syrian immigrants, arguing that conditions in their home country no longer prevent their safe return. The Department of Homeland Security cited national interest and ongoing terrorist activity in Syria as reasons for ending the humanitarian program, which was first established in 2012 during the Syrian civil war. Syrians without another legal basis to remain in the U.S. will face deportation when the program expires in approximately 60 days. This action is part of a broader administration effort to dismantle TPS programs for several countries.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart.com, as the company rapidly expanded its third-party marketplace to compete with Amazon. The report found that lax vetting processes allowed sellers to use stolen business identities to list fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly to fuel growth, turning the platform into what some experts call a "Wild West." In response to the findings, Walmart has asserted its commitment to trust and safety and recently tightened vetting procedures for sellers.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has claimed that China is secretly funding lawsuits filed by U.S. states and cities against the fossil fuel industry, alleging this is a strategy to undermine American energy production. However, the senator's office has not provided direct evidence to substantiate the accusation that a China-linked nonprofit is channeling funds for this specific litigation. Environmental advocates and Democratic lawmakers characterize the claim as an unsubstantiated tactic to protect oil and gas companies from legal accountability for climate change damages.

          <p>Following the death of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, conservative commentators are crediting him with significantly increasing Donald Trump's support among young voters in the 2024 election. Supporters highlight Kirk's grassroots organizing, which mobilized young people to engage in political activities like door-knocking and voter registration, contributing to Trump's improved performance in the 18-29 age demographic. A Fox News voter analysis showed Trump capturing 47% of this group, an 11-point increase from 2020. Republican strategists note that Kirk's work was instrumental in making conservatism more appealing and accessible to a new generation.</p>

The lawsuit contends that police and sanitation workers unlawfully restricted his access to public spaces, even when other members of the public were present. This case adds to growing scrutiny over the LAPD's treatment of the media, following other recent lawsuits and a court order barring the use of less-lethal weapons on journalists.</p>

Roske was arrested near Kavanaugh's home with a handgun and other weapons, motivated by the leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new welcome letter for newly naturalized U.S. citizens, which an analysis by The Atlantic suggests reflects a significant shift in presidential rhetoric. Unlike letters from predecessors like Joe Biden and George W. Bush, which emphasized America as a nation founded on ideals, Trump's letter focuses on assimilation into a shared culture, history, and tradition. The letter frames citizenship as a "sacred bond with our Nation," a term often associated with ethnic polity, aligning with a broader rhetorical change on the right. Critics argue this reframing moves away from the principle that anyone can be an American by embracing its creed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr have recently suggested revoking the broadcast licenses of television stations they deem biased, raising concerns about government overreach and First Amendment rights. Broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC operate on public airwaves licensed by the FCC, which requires them to serve the "public interest." While this authority has historically been used to regulate issues like obscenity or children's programming, the administration is now invoking it based on political coverage. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges, but the threats alone can create a chilling effect.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and allow the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals. This request seeks to freeze a lower court's order that found the administration's attempt to end the humanitarian program was unlawful. The administration argues that TPS was never intended to be a permanent solution and that it should be allowed to end the designation for Venezuelans while the legal battle continues. This move is consistent with the administration's broader policy of ending TPS for multiple countries, including a recent termination for Syrian nationals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to introduce a substantial $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program widely used by technology companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. This new fee, which could be enacted by presidential proclamation, would dramatically increase the cost for employers like Amazon and Microsoft to bring in talent from abroad. The move targets what critics describe as an abuse of the program that undercuts American workers. The administration also plans to order a review of the wage levels for H-1B visa holders to ensure they align with prevailing U.S. wages.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's threats to review ABC's broadcast license over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel. On his podcast, Cruz compared Carr's remarks to those of a "mafioso" and called the suggestion of using government power to punish media content "dangerous as hell." While stating he was personally "thrilled" that Kimmel's show was suspended, Cruz warned that allowing the government to police speech it dislikes would ultimately harm conservatives. This positions Cruz in opposition to President Trump, who praised both Kimmel's suspension and Carr's actions.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research indicates that U.S. electricity demand is set to grow significantly over the next five years, driven largely by the power-hungry needs of new AI data centers. The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates, creating a bullish outlook for industrial companies. Firms like GE Vernova, which produces power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which supplies electrical equipment for the grid, are positioned to benefit from this sustained investment trend. The high demand is creating a multi-year backlog for manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

The cathedral itself reopened in December 2024 and has since attracted nearly 30,000 visitors daily.

In response, Estonia has summoned the Russian chargé d'affaires and requested Article 4 consultations with NATO allies to discuss the threat.

The provision, enacted in July, allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028. The new guidance clarifies which occupations qualify, excluding jobs in sectors like healthcare, legal, and financial services. Importantly, the regulations specify that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments from customers.</p>

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several increasingly affordable options for borrowing money. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are currently one of the cheapest methods, with average rates around 8% and the potential to become even cheaper with future rate cuts due to their variable nature. Home equity loans offer slightly higher but fixed rates, providing more predictable payments. While personal loan rates remain in the double digits, they are still significantly less expensive than credit cards and do not require putting up a home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In remembrances of actor and director Robert Redford, critics are highlighting a consistent theme throughout his career: the hollowness and corrupting influence of winning. From his iconic roles as athletes in "The Natural" and "Downhill Racer" to his directorial work in "Quiz Show," Redford repeatedly explored characters who were too deft for their own good. He was drawn to stories of Pyrrhic victory, believing that American culture's obsession with winning was a deception. This perspective, shaped by his own early experiences, allowed him to create a legacy of films that questioned the nature of success and championed the idea that life is a game that can't be won, only played.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills, with food prices rising at their fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry experts, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm labor in the U.S. Tariffs have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production to other regions. Companies are passing these increased costs on to consumers, sometimes through "shrinkflation," where the product size is reduced while the price remains the same.</p>

          <p>The suspension of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel following pressure from the Trump administration exemplifies the inherent vulnerability of free speech in a democracy, according to a Vox analysis. The article argues that the very openness that allows for dissent also creates space for demagogues to exploit the system and silence critics. While the left has been criticized for its own "cancel culture," the right is now using the machinery of government, like the FCC, to enforce its political will. The swift capitulation of ABC sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting that powerful institutions may be unwilling to withstand government pressure, thereby chilling free expression.</p>

The proposed package includes 30 AH-64 Apache helicopters and 3,200 infantry assault vehicles, which would significantly bolster Israel's military capabilities, though delivery would take several years. This major arms deal comes as Israel faces growing international isolation over its war in Gaza and as some U.S. lawmakers attempt to block offensive weapon sales.
