          <p>Russia launched a large-scale nighttime attack on Kyiv, killing at least three people, including a child, and injuring twelve others. The strikes damaged residential buildings and a kindergarten, prompting a major emergency response in several districts of the Ukrainian capital. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones were reported over multiple Russian regions, leading to precautionary measures like airport restrictions. Amid the ongoing conflict, Ukrainian and US officials are set to meet in New York to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a future ceasefire, a move President Zelenskyy hopes will pressure Russia.</p>

          <p>Family, friends, and officials are commemorating the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's murder by retracing his 1955 train journey from Chicago to Mississippi. The ride, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, includes his cousin Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last living eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was brutally lynched in Mississippi, and his mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral is credited with galvanizing the Civil Rights Movement. Rev. Parker emphasized that the event is not to stir hatred but to remember the progress made and the healing that is still needed.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass has left two children, aged 8 and 10, dead and 17 other people injured. The 23-year-old shooter, identified as Robin Westman, fired a rifle through the church windows before taking their own life. Law enforcement sources indicate Westman, whose mother was a former employee at the church, had posted videos online detailing plans for an attack. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, as the community grapples with the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. While acknowledging stable inflation and modest economic improvement, the central bank expressed caution. It also upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, expecting a modest recovery in domestic demand. This decision comes after recent trade agreements with the U.S. that are expected to influence South Korea's export-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will attend a major military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. This will be Kim's first international summit-level meeting and a significant diplomatic event, with Russian President Vladimir Putin also expected to attend. The visit is seen as a strategic win for Chinese President Xi Jinping, reinforcing his influence with both leaders ahead of potential talks with the U.S. The presence of these leaders highlights shifting geopolitical alignments, while raising questions about whether South Korea's president will also attend.</p>

          <p>The European Union is facing its most severe wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares burned so far this year. Spain and Portugal have been disproportionately affected, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total area scorched across the bloc. A study by the World Weather Attribution group has directly linked the worsening fire conditions in the Mediterranean to climate change, which creates hotter, drier weather that makes vegetation more flammable. These fires also release record amounts of carbon dioxide, creating a feedback loop that further exacerbates climate change and threatens long-term ecosystem stability.</p>

          <p>A controversial temporary immigration facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The announcement follows a federal judge's ruling to effectively wind down operations at the center, denying a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to keep it open. Officials had argued the facility was necessary due to overcrowding at other centers, but the judge was not swayed, noting it was always intended to be temporary. The decision marks a significant development in the legal battles surrounding the state's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two employees of a Southern California surgery center on felony charges of assaulting and impeding federal officers. The staffers, Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, are accused of interfering with ICE agents who were attempting to detain landscapers in the facility's parking lot in July. According to court documents, the employees physically intervened and verbally challenged the agents as they arrested an unauthorized immigrant who had run inside the building. The indictment allows the case to proceed to trial, reflecting an aggressive prosecutorial stance on interference with federal immigration operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The resale value of pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks has dropped significantly, with the average used price now just over $84,000, a nearly 30% decrease from the previous year. This trend is part of a larger downturn for all used Tesla models, which have seen an average price drop of about 14% year-over-year. Experts point to various factors, including CEO Elon Musk's public image and a general decline in new Tesla sales in 2025. The vehicle, initially teased with a price under $40,000, ultimately launched at double that cost, contributing to consumer disillusionment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by continued high demand for its artificial intelligence chips. The company also issued a strong sales forecast, projecting revenue growth to remain above 50% for the upcoming quarter. Despite the positive results, Nvidia's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirms the company's central role in the global AI infrastructure boom, with expectations of trillions in spending by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

A presidential spokesperson confirmed that Milei was unharmed, but the attack cut the rally short and has heightened political tensions ahead of provincial and midterm elections. The elections are seen as a critical test of the libertarian president's popularity and his controversial economic policies aimed at curbing inflation and fiscal deficits.</p>

The delay had frustrated industry advocates who see the role as crucial for keeping production jobs in L.A., especially as the city faces stiff competition from other locations offering tax incentives and cheaper labor.

Beyond the visible military presence, federal agencies like ICE are conducting raids, and the city's local police now report directly to the White House. This strategy targets gangs, drug dealers, and undocumented immigrants, creating a tense atmosphere in many neighborhoods.

Factors like climate change-induced drying, water overuse, and wildfires are contributing to conditions ripe for these massive storms, which can carry a wall of dust thousands of feet high. These events pose serious health risks by carrying toxic materials like pesticides and fungal spores that can damage lungs, as well as environmental consequences like darkening mountain snow and reducing solar panel efficiency.

The loss adds to a poor start for the club under manager Ruben Amorim, whose team has struggled despite a £200 million investment in attacking players over the summer. The performance raises serious questions about the direction of the club and the effectiveness of Amorim's system, which has seen talented young players like Kobbie Mainoo marginalized.
