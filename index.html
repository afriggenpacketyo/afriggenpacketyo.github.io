          <p>India's consumer inflation rate fell to 2.1% in June, a figure lower than economists' forecasts and marking a six-year low. The decline, driven by a contraction in food prices, gives the Reserve Bank of India more leeway to consider further monetary policy easing. Strong agricultural production is expected to keep food inflation low, which could boost consumer spending and accelerate economic growth. However, potential U.S. tariffs and weather-related uncertainties remain key risks to the country's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of southern England, effective July 22, due to low rainfall and high demand. The restrictions, covering areas in Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, and Berkshire, prohibit activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hose. This action comes as the Environment Agency declared a state of prolonged dry weather in the region. The water company stated that with supplies stretched and no significant improvement expected, the measures are necessary to manage resources during the hot, dry summer months.</p>

          <p>Rescue and recovery operations are ongoing in the Texas Hill Country following devastating floods that have led to at least 130 fatalities, with searches continuing for missing individuals. A flood watch remains in effect for the area, with forecasts predicting more heavy rainfall that could exacerbate the situation. The region may see isolated rainfall amounts of up to five inches through Monday evening. Authorities anticipate a period of dry weather to begin later in the week, which could provide some relief to the flood-ravaged communities.</p>

          <p>The president of the global players' union, Fifpro, has sharply criticized FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, calling its promotion a "fiction" that disregards player welfare. In a scathing statement, Sergio Marchi accused FIFA of prioritizing revenue at the expense of players' health and drew parallels between President Gianni Infantino and the Roman emperor Nero. The comments intensify existing tensions after Fifpro filed a legal complaint against FIFA last year over the congested fixture schedule, arguing that the governing body is abusing its power under European competition law.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's recent guilty plea in the murder of four University of Idaho students has brought the case to an abrupt end, leaving the central question of motive unanswered. With the trial canceled, the public is turning to upcoming documentaries and a book to understand the crime. Kohberger's plea deal allows him to avoid the death penalty in exchange for four consecutive life sentences, a decision that has drawn mixed reactions from victims' families. Despite overwhelming evidence, including DNA and cell phone records, his plea included no admission of why he committed the murders.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that the state-owned enterprise could be transformed into a mutually-owned business. This proposal, which has been discussed for over a decade, is being revisited as part of an effort to reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal. The consultation will explore how to meet changing consumer needs, what services should be offered, and how to strengthen the relationship with postmasters. Proponents argue that a mutual model could prevent future scandals by giving staff a greater stake in management.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old palliative care specialist has gone on trial in Berlin, Germany, accused of murdering 15 of his patients between 2021 and 2024.

The accused is said to have acted as a "master of life and death," exploiting his patients' trust under the guise of providing medical care. The case, which authorities describe as motivated by a "lust for murder," has drawn comparisons to other medical serial killer cases in Germany.</p>

The report, commissioned by production company Banijay, found the majority of upheld claims related to sexual humor and culturally insensitive or racist comments over a 19-year period. Wallace, who was recently sacked from the show, has been diagnosed with autism, which the report notes should be considered as context but not an excuse.

          <p>A recent federal immigration sweep in Pacoima, California, resulted in a chaotic scene where a 54-year-old woman fainted and suffered a heart attack during her arrest, and a U.S. citizen was arrested while filming the incident. Eyewitness videos and interviews depict a tense confrontation between federal agents and the public, highlighting controversial tactics used in recent enforcement operations. A federal judge has since ordered a halt to such indiscriminate sweeps, citing evidence of racial profiling. The incident underscores public outrage over the methods employed in the administration's immigration crackdown.</p>

          <h2>Widespread Flood Risk Across the U.S. Contrasts with Low Insurance Coverage</h2>

          <p>Despite nearly every U.S. county experiencing flooding in recent decades, only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance, creating a significant protection gap. Experts warn that standard homeowner policies do not cover flooding, and federal disaster aid is often insufficient, leaving many to bear the full cost of recovery. With climate change fueling more intense rainfall, the risk is growing nationwide. While the National Flood Insurance Program is available, rising premiums are making it unaffordable for many, forcing residents to gamble on whether their homes will be hit.</p>

          <p>Serbia is facing "tough" negotiations with the United States to secure a fifth waiver from sanctions against its Russian-owned national oil company, NIS. The current reprieve is set to expire on July 29, placing Serbia in a difficult position as it tries to protect its energy security while navigating geopolitical pressures. NIS, which is majority-owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft and Gazprom, operates Serbia's only oil refinery. A failure to extend the waiver could jeopardize the country's crude oil supply and disrupt its energy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis based on interviews with diplomats and officials reveals an unofficial formula foreign leaders use for successful interactions with former President Donald Trump. The strategy combines a mix of flattery, such as praise or symbolic gifts, with firm advocacy for their own national interests. Leaders meticulously prepare for meetings, war-gaming potential surprises and sharing best practices with allies to navigate Trump's unpredictable nature. This approach aims to build personal rapport and avoid conflict while still achieving diplomatic objectives, reflecting a new reality in international relations during his political tenure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the controversy surrounding Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), which some U.S. states and the EU have classified as "green" energy. While natural gas emits less CO2 than coal when burned, its primary component is methane, a greenhouse gas 85 times more potent than CO2 over a 20-year period. The energy-intensive process of fracking, cooling, and transporting LNG, combined with methane leaks throughout the supply chain, leads some scientists to conclude its overall climate footprint is worse than coal's. This challenges its role as a sustainable "bridge" fuel. (not investment advice)</p>
