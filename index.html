          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Michael Friedman as his new chief of staff, a decision confirmed by two sources familiar with the matter. Friedman previously played a key role in selecting staff for the Treasury Department through the White House Office of Presidential Personnel during President Trump's second term. Bessent stated that Friedman's transition from staffing to management is natural, and he will be instrumental in advancing President Trump's America First Economic Agenda. Friedman, who holds degrees from NYU and Harvard Law, replaces Dan Katz, who is moving to the International Monetary Fund as first deputy managing director.</p>

          <p>Sports radio legend Mike Francesa vehemently criticized the New York Mets, labeling them "gutless bums" after they missed the MLB playoffs despite boasting the league's highest payroll at $340 million. The team, which reached the NLCS last season, experienced a colossal collapse, recording an unfathomable 38-55 record since June 12. Francesa expressed outrage at their consistent underachievement and lack of resilience throughout the season. Adding to the team's woes for 2026, star slugger Pete Alonso announced his decision to opt out and test free agency.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown, if it extends beyond a short period, could significantly disrupt air travel due to anticipated staffing shortages at the FAA and TSA. Although most employees, including air traffic controllers and screeners, are deemed essential and required to work without pay, a prolonged impasse could lead to increased sick calls and even resignations. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion weekly and hinder the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers. However, train travel and passport services are expected to remain largely unaffected in the near term.</p>

          <p>Washington is barreling towards a government shutdown as Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over federal funding, with a deadline looming. Democrats are insisting on an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits as part of any funding package, a proposal rejected by Republicans and the White House. Following a White House meeting with President Trump, both sides placed blame on the opposing party for the potential crisis, indicating little progress was made. The Trump administration has also threatened mass firings of federal workers, adding another layer of tension to the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase by significantly overstating her company's customer base. JPMorgan acquired Frank in 2021 for $175 million, believing it served over five million students, only to discover fewer than 300,000 real customers months later. Javice expressed profound remorse in court, asking for forgiveness from all affected parties. However, Judge Alvin Hellerstein delivered an 85-month prison sentence, along with $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution, emphasizing the need for deterrence.</p>

White House budget director Russell Vought's directive to consider significant downsizing has fueled concerns about a dramatically reoriented federal government, aligning with conservative hardliner objectives. While Trump technically lacks new legal authority to permanently fire civil servants during a shutdown, the administration's past actions and the belief that radical objectives are politically tenable in an emergency raise questions about the potential for significant bureaucratic changes.

          <p>Two attorneys from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) anti-discrimination division were fired after publicly releasing a whistleblower report. The report alleged that the Trump administration was systematically dismantling efforts to combat residential segregation, effectively making fighting discrimination "not a priority." Paul Osadebe and Palmer Heenan were terminated for disclosing "non-public information," which they contend is a direct violation of federal whistleblower protection laws. Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the firings, asserting that the administration is attempting to silence critics who speak out against its policies impacting civil rights and vulnerable populations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Implications of Trump's Proposed Tariffs on Non-U.S. Made Movies</h2>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his threat to impose 100% tariffs on films not made in the U.S., claiming the American movie-making business has been "stolen" by other countries. This article delves into the complexities and potential far-reaching implications of such a protectionist policy. Industry experts question the enforceability of tariffs on services like movies and warn of significant "chaos" within the entertainment industry, potential international retaliation, and increased costs for consumers. The move underscores the ongoing challenge of bringing film production back to Hollywood, which has increasingly shifted overseas due to attractive tax incentives and lower labor costs.</p>

          <p>Hurricanes Humberto and Tropical Storm Imelda are expected to bring dangerous surf and rip current conditions to much of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. Humberto, a powerful Category 4 hurricane, is forecast to pass west and then north of Bermuda, while Imelda is anticipated to strengthen into a hurricane and move away from the southeastern U.S. coastline towards Bermuda. Both storm systems pose life-threatening hazards along beaches from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic, with waves potentially reaching 7 to 11 feet in some areas. Residents are strongly advised to monitor local advisories and exercise extreme caution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown this time could have unusual economic impacts, departing from historical precedents, primarily due to President Trump's threat of making some federal employee furloughs permanent. While past shutdowns typically had marginal, short-term economic effects that were often recouped later, the prospect of permanent job losses could significantly destabilize the labor market. This impact would be particularly felt in the Washington, D.C. region, which has already experienced prior layoffs. Furthermore, a prolonged shutdown risks delaying the release of crucial economic data from agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, thereby complicating decision-making for both financial markets and the Federal Reserve.

The West Indies, currently sixth in the T20 rankings, have faced a series of recent setbacks, including a crushing Test defeat by Australia and a failure to qualify for the 2023 50-over World Cup.

          <p>Portland is bracing for the deployment of 200 National Guard troops as President Trump moves ahead with plans to send federal forces into the city, prompting Oregon to file a lawsuit to block the action. The state argues there is no legal justification for the deployment and warns it will likely escalate tensions and lead to unrest. Trump claims Portland is "war ravaged" and ICE facilities are under attack, assertions that Oregon officials dispute as based on bad information. This move follows previous federal deployments to the city during racial justice protests, which resulted in clashes and heightened public outcry.</p>
