          <p>Israel launched a series of strikes across Iran, targeting what it described as the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of senior military figures and nuclear scientists, according to Iranian state media reports which also reported civilian casualties. The Israeli military reported that Iran launched approximately 100 drones toward Israel, all of which were reportedly intercepted. The strikes, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, prompted a state of emergency in Israel and have been condemned by various international actors. The US stated it was not involved in the strikes, while Iran vowed to defend its sovereignty and held the US responsible as Israel's primary patron, heightening tensions in the region and raising concerns about potential escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth element (REE) reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates REE production and processing. With the world facing a rare earths shortage due to China's export curbs, India sees an opportunity to become an alternative supplier. While India possesses substantial REE reserves, it lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan. Overcoming these challenges through public and private investment, along with developing specialized technical expertise and improving infrastructure in mining regions, will be crucial for India to realize its potential in the global REE supply chain.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway to determine who is funding anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities, after a company specializing in providing crowds for protests reported receiving numerous high-budget requests to participate. The company declined involvement due to concerns about illegal activity and violence, while Senator Josh Hawley has launched an investigation into organizations believed to be behind the funding, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA). CHIRLA, which has received significant state funding, is accused of providing logistical support to rioters, prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest and the legality of bankrolling civil unrest.

          <p>The Japanese government has unveiled a 100 billion yen policy package to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create an elite research environment amid global competition in fields like AI and semiconductors. This initiative is partly motivated by the departure of researchers from the United States due to funding cuts and prioritization of American students. The policy will fund existing programs, such as Tohoku University's recruitment plan, and aims to raise researcher salaries, reduce administrative burdens, and acquire advanced technology for institutions. Despite recent efforts, Japan's ranking in highly cited scientific papers remains low, prompting the government to consider additional measures to retain researchers.</p>

The bill grants the immigration minister extensive powers to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake, with no appeal process, impacting refugees and women. It also amends the Criminal Code to allow greater access to citizen data and telecommunications information without a warrant in "exigent circumstances," raising concerns about privacy rights. Critics argue the bill aligns Canada with US-style refugee policies and creates a surveillance state, undermining the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>

The Trump administration's travel ban and potential embassy closures raise concerns about accessibility for fans, while civil unrest in Southern California poses a threat to the event's success. Despite these challenges, organizers express optimism, highlighting the importance of welcoming the world and delivering a positive experience.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland experienced a fourth consecutive night of disorder, with incidents in Portadown involving masonry thrown at police, although the level of violence was lower than earlier in the week. The unrest, which began in Ballymena following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, has resulted in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests. Police have warned of using baton rounds if crowds do not disperse, and a heavy police presence is maintained in affected areas. The PSNI Chief Constable described the violence as "racist" and targeted at ethnic minorities and law enforcement, prompting calls for calm and an end to the violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran and Israel, once allies, have become sworn enemies over the past few decades, with Iran threatening Israel's annihilation and Israel regarding Iran as its biggest adversary. The shift occurred after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini scrapped agreements with Israel and criticized its occupation of Palestinian territories. Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maintains an antagonistic stance, questioning the Holocaust and supporting anti-Israel groups like Hezbollah. While some Iranians question this hostility, staunch backers support it as opposition to great powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China by the United States, Beijing has encouraged the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, serve as a guarantee to the seller that the agreed amount will be paid by the buyer in time, enhancing payment security and credit. Unlike international L/Cs, which can only be used in transactions involving physical goods, domestic L/Cs can also be used in the trade in services. The payment period for domestic L/Cs is generally one year.</p>

          <p>German machinery makers, represented by the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), are calling for EU action on China due to dwindling exports and increasing competition from Chinese companies. The VDMA is demanding that Brussels impose trade barriers to protect the industry, citing "unfair state subsidies" that give Chinese rivals an advantage. The industry group, representing medium-sized manufacturers, feels that fair competition is lacking and wants governments to intervene. They propose that the EU should impose countervailing duties on imports from third countries if they violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules.</p>

          <p>Japan expects to receive special treatment in its tariff negotiations with the United States once a deal is finalized, according to Tokyo's top negotiator. This expectation comes after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a potential increase in import levies on cars, which would further hurt Japan's automotive industry. Ryosei Akazawa is visiting Washington for the fourth time in as many weeks to make progress in the talks, with the goal of securing concessions on auto tariffs. Japan is also seeking the removal of other sector-based and reciprocal tariffs, while Trump aims to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>North Korea claims it has successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during the first attempted launch. Kim Jong Un oversaw the relaunch, demanding quick repairs after the initial failure, which led to the arrest of at least four officials. Experts question the completeness of the repairs given the rapid relaunch, while state media says the ship has been fully restored. The warship is one of two new destroyers, the largest in North Korea's fleet, capable of launching nuclear weapons, as Kim prioritizes developing a nuclear-armed navy.</p>

          <p>Markets in Asia opened lower while oil prices surged following Israeli strikes in Iran, escalating tensions over Tehran's nuclear program. Tokyo's Nikkei 225, Seoul's Kospi, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite Index all experienced declines, while U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude both rose significantly. Analysts suggest Asian markets are expected to recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties to unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This follows a day where U.S. stock indexes ticked higher due to encouraging inflation updates, with Oracle's strong performance offsetting Boeing's loss after the Air India crash.</p>

          <p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel would continue attacking Iran to eliminate its nuclear program, targeting facilities for nuclear fuel, bomb assembly, and rocket construction, while also claiming assassinations of key personnel. Israel has been contemplating this attack for two decades, but the timing is attributed to the belief that Iran was rushing to assemble nuclear weapons. Israel has been piercing Iran's immunity by attacking Iranian soldiers abroad, killing proxies, and attacking its territory, diminishing Iran's deterrent power. With a weakened Axis of Resistance, Iran has less to bargain with, making a nuclear weapon the only way to recover lost deference.</p>

          <p>Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is reportedly wanted in Miami-Dade County on a charge of attempted murder with a firearm. The charge stems from a May 16 shooting outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, where Brown allegedly punched a man, grabbed a firearm from a security officer, and fired two shots at the individual. The alleged victim told police one bullet may have grazed his neck, leading to the felony charge requiring a $10,000 bond and house arrest. The attempted murder charge adds to a growing list of legal troubles for Brown, whose post-NFL career has been marred by erratic behavior and repeated run-ins with the law.</p>

          <p>According to the head researcher at the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins are not an alternative to gold, nor do they pose a threat to its role as a safe-haven investment.

Reade wishes that proponents of digital assets would stop marketing them as 'gold 2.0' because they clearly have different characteristics.
