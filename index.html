          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage and reconnect with real-world experiences, as evidenced by the popularity of offline meetups and digital detox retreats. Studies indicate that many young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire a "digital curfew" to limit access to certain apps and websites. Governments are considering measures such as mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media use to address the harmful effects of excessive smartphone use on mental health. The article notes that while digital media use increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, research has not yet proven a direct causal link between digital media use and mental health deterioration. </p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's eastern entrance, including Tioga Road, will reopen on Memorial Day, May 26, after being closed since November due to ice and snow. This year's reopening is about two weeks earlier than last year and a month earlier than the year before. Visitors planning to enter Yosemite between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. during the holiday weekend will need a reservation, and staffing shortages are anticipated due to cuts at the National Park Service. Park officials are urging visitors to be patient and courteous to staff, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their dogs. The research found that when owners dwell on work problems after hours, their pets exhibit more signs of stress, such as whining, pacing, or restlessness. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their pets. Dogs are particularly sensitive to their ownersâ€™ moods and changes in care routines, which can affect their well-being. </p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind the worldâ€™s fastest electromagnetic coilgun, capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. The footage, released by a state-owned arms manufacturer, has garnered attention among military experts, as this firing capacity surpasses current weaponry. A peer-reviewed paper detailed the elimination of capacitors, the Achillesâ€™ heel of electromagnetic weapons, with the coilgun now powered directly by lithium batteries. This innovation eliminates lag times for recharging, which had previously capped the firing rate of coilguns. </p>
