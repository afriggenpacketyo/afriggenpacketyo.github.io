        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir increased its revenue forecast following strong growth in both commercial and government sectors, driven by what CEO Alex Karp describes as a 'tectonic shift' in AI adoption. The company's commercial revenues jumped 71%, while government sales increased by 45%, with U.S. commercial revenues expected to exceed $1.178 billion this year. Karp credited the government sector growth to increased U.S. defense adoption and noted a surge in demand for large language models and supporting software. Despite the positive outlook, Palantir's shares experienced a slight after-hours decline of approximately 5% following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed a recent policy, reducing the rate at which it recovers overpayments from beneficiaries to 50%, down from 100%. This adjustment follows concerns that the higher clawback rate, implemented under the direction of Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, was causing financial hardship for many recipients. The SSA's inspector general found that a significant number of overpayments were due to the agency's calculation errors. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, advocates worry that even a 50% clawback will still burden disabled workers who rely heavily on their Social Security benefits.</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned House Democrats for attempting to obstruct President Trump's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America.' White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly accused Democrats of being consumed by 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' and prioritizing obstruction over American interests. The House Rules Committee is considering a bill to codify the name change, but Democrats have introduced amendments aimed at undermining the legislation. The White House insists that the Gulf of America is an integral asset to the nation and that future generations should recognize it as a symbol of American greatness.</p>

While competitors have provided updated guidance, Ford executives are waiting for more clarity on retaliatory tariffs and consumer reactions to potential price increases.
