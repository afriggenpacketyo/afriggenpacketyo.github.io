          <p>An individual was shot outside CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, early Thursday morning, prompting a security response and the closure of the main gate. Fairfax County Police assisted with traffic control following the incident, which occurred on Dolley Madison Boulevard around 4 a.m. ET. The CIA spokesperson confirmed the event as a "security incident" and stated that more details would be released as appropriate. Authorities have stated that there is no apparent link between this shooting and the separate shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members in D.C. earlier in the day.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price continued its upward trajectory, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's value has diverged, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. Positive momentum is also fueled by growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation and support from figures like President Trump, who aims to have crypto regulation ready for signing by August. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, previously a Bitcoin skeptic, has also announced that the bank will now allow clients to buy the digital currency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leadership and workplace researcher Zach Mercurio suggests that the ability to engage in meaningful small talk is a key skill for effective leaders, more so than traditional perks. According to Mercurio, employees feel valued when their bosses take a genuine interest in their lives and acknowledge their needs. He emphasizes that small interactions, where someone truly sees and hears them, remind employees that they're needed. This is especially crucial for remote workers and those in underappreciated positions, who may feel disconnected without casual personal interactions.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," claims that former White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates was instrumental in defending President Joe Biden's mental acuity, potentially without full knowledge of the President's actual condition. The book suggests a "modus operandi" by the Biden administration to discredit journalists raising questions about the President's age. Bates has dismissed the book's narrative as distorted. The book also details how the White House allegedly killed a story by aggressively disputing claims about Biden's cognitive decline to a national news outlet.</p>

He also extended an olive branch to opposition parties, offering to brief their leaders on national security matters. This shift in tone comes after Lai consistently asserted Taiwan's independence and described Beijing as a "hostile foreign force" since taking office last year.</p>

Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks and exploring short-term CDs, which currently offer more competitive interest rates due to the inverted yield curve.

To improve your chances of securing a great rate, start by strengthening your credit profile and shop around to compare different lenders.

          <p>ASML has developed High NA, the world's most advanced and expensive chipmaking machine, costing over $400 million. The machine is transforming how microchips are made and is composed of four modules manufactured in different locations. The first commercial installation happened at Intel's Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024. High NA improves chip designs by projecting them at a higher resolution, which in turn improves yield and lowers chip prices. It is expected to be used by major chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.</p>
