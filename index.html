          <p>A Kremlin aide has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to meet in the coming days to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. This development follows a visit to Moscow by a U.S. envoy and Trump's statement about a "good chance" of a trilateral summit including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. While Zelensky has expressed support for such a meeting, the Kremlin remains noncommittal on a three-way format, stating the prerequisites have not yet been met. Preparations for the bilateral Trump-Putin summit are reportedly underway.</p>

          <p>A new Taiwanese television drama, "Zero Day Attack," which imagines a Chinese invasion in 2028, has become a cultural phenomenon, topping ratings and igniting debate about national security and identity. The series reflects a growing trend in Taiwanese media to explore the once-taboo subject of a potential conflict with Beijing, inspired in part by Ukraine's resistance against Russia. While some praise the show for raising awareness of Chinese infiltration, others, including the opposition KMT party, criticize it for promoting a "sense of national doom." The show's creators maintain their goal is to foster rational dialogue about a realistic threat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially enacted a new wave of tariffs, imposing duties ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from approximately 70 countries, including major allies like the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. This live report details the global repercussions, such as Brazil filing a WTO complaint and India vowing to protect its farmers from a 50% total tariff. While the White House claims the move will boost federal revenue, economists warn of potential inflation as costs are passed to consumers, and global business leaders express concern over the resulting uncertainty.

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, resulted in nearly 12% weight loss for patients in a late-stage clinical trial. While the results were slightly below some Wall Street expectations, the pill is seen as a potential game-changer for offering a needle-free alternative to popular injectable treatments. The convenience of an oral medication could significantly expand access for millions of patients and help Eli Lilly solidify its position in the booming weight-loss drug market. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 years after D.C. police officer Denna Fredericka Campbell was killed, her then-live-in boyfriend, Amir Jalil Ali, has been charged with her murder. Campbell had ominously told colleagues that if she didn't show up for work, they would know he had killed her, and she had been sleeping with her service weapon for protection. Charges were initially filed against Ali in 1995 but were mysteriously dropped by prosecutors. The renewed investigation and recent arrest bring a long-awaited sense of resolution to her family and former colleagues in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>An ISIS-affiliated group in Mozambique is reportedly carrying out a campaign of brutal attacks on Christian communities, including beheadings and the burning of churches and homes. The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) has labeled the violence a "silent genocide" that is largely being ignored by the international community. Recent photos released by the militants are said to document raids on villages in the Cabo Delgado province, where thousands have been displaced by the ongoing insurgency. The violence appears aimed at eliminating Christian communities and expanding jihadist control in the region.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force successfully conducted a high-risk medical evacuation of three people from the American McMurdo research station in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was carried out in perpetual winter darkness and sub-zero temperatures, requiring the flight crew to use night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials praised the operation as "nothing short of heroic," highlighting the extreme challenges of such flights. The mission was initiated because the research base lacked sufficient medical resources to treat the individuals' conditions.</p>

          <p>Startup Neurable is pioneering non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) integrated into everyday devices like headphones, which can monitor brain activity to measure focus and potentially detect early signs of neurological conditions. Unlike current health trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, these BCI-equipped gadgets use EEG sensors to analyze brainwaves directly, offering real-time insights into cognitive states. While the technology does not read thoughts, it can identify distraction or signs of anxiety, with future applications possibly including the early detection of Alzheimer's or depression. This represents a significant shift toward proactive brain health monitoring.</p>

          <p>A new law capping federal graduate student loans has drawn sharp criticism from the American Medical Association, which warns it could create a significant financial barrier for aspiring doctors. The legislation limits lifetime borrowing for professional programs like medical school to $200,000, an amount well below the average cost of a medical degree. Experts predict this will disproportionately affect students from lower-income backgrounds and could exacerbate the projected nationwide shortage of physicians. The changes may force more students to rely on private loans, which lack the protections and flexible repayment options of federal aid. (not investment advice)</p>

A source close to the minister stated that the tenants were on a fixed-term contract and chose to leave while the house was for sale, and that she complied with all legal requirements.

          <h2>ICE Arrests in Los Angeles Declined in July After Initial Surge</h2>

          <p>New data from Homeland Security shows that arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area dropped significantly in July compared to the previous month, though they remain higher than historical averages. Federal authorities arrested fewer than 1,400 people in the last month, a notable decrease from the nearly 2,800 arrests in the month prior, which marked the start of an aggressive deportation operation. The slowdown follows a federal court order that blocked agents from targeting people without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally, a ruling the Trump administration is likely to appeal.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Seeks to Protect Access to HIV Prevention Drugs Amid Federal Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers are advancing a bill designed to safeguard access to HIV prevention drugs like PrEP and PEP, in response to perceived threats from the Trump administration. The proposed legislation would mandate that state-regulated health plans cover all FDA-approved antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention without cost-sharing or prior authorization. Advocates are concerned by the administration's budget cuts to HIV prevention and recent moves to review the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which recommends coverage for such medications. The bill aims to create a state-level shield to ensure these critical treatments remain accessible to insured Californians.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The nation's first-ever mandated work requirement for Medicaid recipients is projected to have a massive impact in California, with state officials estimating that up to 3.4 million people could lose their health coverage. The new rule requires many adults on Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, to prove they are working, in school, or volunteering for at least 80 hours a month. Health advocates warn that even eligible individuals will likely lose coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles and complex verification processes, while proponents argue it will encourage work and preserve the program for those most in need.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of homeowners affected by the January wildfires in Los Angeles County have filed complaints against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, alleging its contractors mishandled debris removal. Survivors report that crews failed to thoroughly clear properties, left behind hazardous materials like damaged foundations and contaminated pool water, and did not adhere to their own protocols for soil removal. These shortcomings have raised fears of long-term soil contamination and left many property owners facing unexpected costs to complete the cleanup, questioning whether the rapid pace of the operation sacrificed quality and safety.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that Los Angeles should pull out of hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics, especially now that President Trump is heading a federal task force for the event. The author contends that Trump, who has a history of hostility towards L.A., will use the Games as a political tool to humiliate the city and broadcast his power, potentially deploying the military as he did during recent mass deportations. The piece asserts that the city has more pressing issues to address and that the supposed economic benefits of the Olympics rarely materialize, making the risk of a Trump-co-opted spectacle too great.</p>

          <p>In this satirical column, the author humorously adopts the persona of someone who believes everything is rigged against them, from their bathroom scale to their book sales rankings on Amazon. The piece mimics the conspiratorial language often used in modern political discourse, blaming inaccuracies on a corrupt county administration, illegal voting, and a biased system. The author fires his barber, sues his financial advisor, and investigates his neighbor for putting a trash can on his property line. The column serves as a sharp, comedic critique of the tendency to reject any unwelcome facts as part of a grand, fraudulent scheme.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece condemns California Governor Gavin Newsom's plan to redraw the state's congressional districts as a cynical political maneuver that undermines democracy. Newsom aims to counter a Republican gerrymander in Texas by giving the Democratic-controlled legislature power to draw new maps for the 2026 midterms, bypassing the state's independent commission established by voters. The author argues that two wrongs don't make a right and that by stooping to this level, Newsom and California Democrats lose the moral high ground in their fight against Trump's attacks on democratic institutions. Voters are urged to reject this hypocritical power grab.</p>

          <p>This op-ed argues that President Trump's push for a mid-decade redistricting in Texas exemplifies a dangerous new era in American politics where procedural norms are disregarded for partisan gain. The author compares Trump to a circus elephant who never learned the rules of restraint, and whose success in breaking them has inspired both Republicans and Democrats to abandon prior conventions. The piece warns that this escalating political hardball, from Texas Democrats fleeing the state to blue states considering retaliation, is leading to a "mutually assured destruction" scenario that destabilizes democracy for minimal, if any, political advantage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1906 Azusa Street revival in Los Angeles, the birthplace of modern Pentecostalism, as a model for a more inclusive American democracy. Led by William J. Seymour, the son of formerly enslaved parents, the movement brought together a racially and ethnically diverse congregation that defied the era's segregationist norms. The author argues that these early Black migrant communities, who reimagined democracy through a lens of faith and shared dignity, offer a powerful lesson for today's fractured society. Their story demonstrates that democracy is continually remade by ordinary people who resist divisive hierarchies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers in Congress are pushing legislation to make it easier for veterans to use their VA benefits for healthcare at local, non-VA facilities, a program known as community care. Proponents argue this is necessary for rural veterans who live far from VA hospitals or need services the VA doesn't readily provide, and would help struggling rural hospitals. However, critics and some veterans' advocacy groups worry that diverting federal funds to private care could weaken the specialized VA hospital system. The debate centers on balancing convenience for veterans with the need to maintain a robust, dedicated VA infrastructure.</p>
