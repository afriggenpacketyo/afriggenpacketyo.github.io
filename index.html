          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has advanced to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a grueling five-set victory over Nicolas Jarry. Norrie initially led by two sets and held a match point in the third before Jarry mounted a strong comeback, pushing the match to a decisive fifth set. After four hours and 27 minutes, Norrie ultimately secured the win, becoming the sole remaining British competitor in the singles tournament. The match featured some tension, with Jarry expressing irritation at Norrie's on-court behavior, but Norrie described it as a competitive and enjoyable battle.</p>

          <p>The father of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Columbia University professor Mahmood Mamdani, has drawn scrutiny for controversial statements made during a 2022 panel. He claimed that Adolf Hitler was inspired by Abraham Lincoln's creation of reservations for Native Americans and that Nazi Germany's Nuremberg Laws were patterned after American laws. The elder Mamdani also asserted that the Allied forces in World War II shared the Nazi goal of creating ethnically 'pure' nations. These remarks have resurfaced as his son, a self-proclaimed socialist, gains political prominence in New York City.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in at least 70 deaths, with two young sisters from Dallas, aged 13 and 11, among the confirmed victims. The girls were staying with their grandparents, who remain unaccounted for, near the Guadalupe River when the waters surged unexpectedly. An all-girls summer camp, Camp Mystic, was also severely impacted, with multiple campers and a counselor still missing after the river rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes. A massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies is underway, with hundreds of people already saved.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett stated that the "rough outlines" of new trade agreements are becoming clear as a key tariff deadline approaches this week. He anticipates that several deals will be finalized, with existing agreements with the U.K. and Vietnam serving as models for negotiations with other nations. Hassett also mentioned that letters will be sent to countries where deals are not yet advanced, potentially spurring last-minute agreements before a 90-day pause on new tariffs expires. The administration is touting its strategy as a success for creating U.S. jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River in Texas, has become the center of a tragic disaster after catastrophic flash floods struck the region. The camp, which hosted hundreds of young girls, was devastated by a sudden surge of water, resulting in multiple fatalities, including that of eight-year-old camper Renee Smajstrla. The incident has raised questions about the safety of locating youth camps so close to the river, although local officials note the area's natural beauty is what draws them there.

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was marred by controversy when the electronic line-calling system failed at a critical moment. The system did not register a clear out-ball from Kartal, leading the umpire to replay the point instead of awarding it to Pavlyuchenkova, who subsequently lost the game. Although Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match, she expressed significant frustration, stating a game was "stolen" from her and questioning the umpire's refusal to make a manual call.

He stated that people are worried about affordability and the economy, but they perceive Democrats as being primarily focused on other issues.

The move signals a significant political disruption, as Musk's immense wealth could influence the 2026 midterm elections.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which have claimed nearly 70 lives, are highlighting the profound challenges of forecasting extreme weather in an era of climate change. An analysis shows the rainfall was an exceedingly rare event, with some areas receiving the equivalent of a 1-in-1,000-year downpour. While the National Weather Service did issue watches and warnings, the initial rainfall predictions were about half of what ultimately fell, and staffing shortages may have complicated communications. The tragedy underscores the difficulty of predicting the precise location and intensity of such events, which are becoming more frequent.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) and DW's Director General have strongly condemned an attack on a DW correspondent and cameraman by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The journalists, who were clearly marked as press, were covering a protest against settler violence when they were chased and had stones thrown at them, causing significant damage to their vehicle. Crews from other news organizations, including AFP and the New York Times, were also forced to flee. The incident has prompted calls for the Israeli government to ensure the safety of all journalists.</p>

          <p>The dire state of Libya's healthcare system is forcing families to undertake dangerous sea crossings to Europe in search of medical treatment. The case of 7-year-old Sohan Aboulsoud, who has cystic fibrosis, went viral after her mother shared a photo of her on a smuggler's boat to Italy because she could not get care in Libya. Since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, political instability has shattered the country's health infrastructure, leaving many facilities non-functional and essential medicines unavailable. This has created a desperate situation, pushing Libyans to risk their lives for basic healthcare needs.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of China's People's Liberation Army, have called for structural reforms to better counter modern drone threats. The article suggests that it is highly likely the Chinese military will establish specialized counter-drone units to enable rapid responses, addressing inefficiencies in current structures. Citing the crucial role of drones in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine, the experts propose integrating these new capabilities into existing forces, such as upgrading electronic warfare units. This reflects a strategic shift that began as early as 2016.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of vandalizing portraits of the Windrush generation in Brixton. The portraits, part of the "Windrush Untold Stories" exhibition in Windrush Square, were damaged on Thursday, causing considerable distress in the community. While some community groups described the act as being driven by racial hatred, the police have stated that they do not currently believe it was a hate crime. The exhibition features portraits and first-hand accounts of individuals who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between the 1940s and 1970s.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the potential elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In a recent interview, Burns defended public media entities like PBS and NPR, which have been targeted by the White House for allegedly spreading "radical, woke propaganda." Burns, whose films have aired on PBS for decades, argued that the network serves a vital role, especially in rural areas, and provides a unique platform for long-form, in-depth projects that commercial outlets would not support. He expressed worry over the future of these American institutions.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are facing a critical week with only days remaining to secure a trade deal with Washington and avert President Trump's threatened tariffs. With the July 9 deadline fast approaching, uncertainty remains over how the EU will be treated, threatening €1.6 trillion in transatlantic trade. There appears to be a split among EU leaders, with some, like Germany's chancellor, favoring a quick deal, while others, like France's president, advocate for holding out for a better one. Brussels is now aiming for a framework agreement similar to the one the UK secured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR producer in Gaza has provided a harrowing first-person account of the perilous journey to obtain food from a new U.S.- and Israel-supported distribution site. The journalist describes facing Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and desperate crowds fighting with knives just to secure basic rations like rice and cooking oil. According to the report, hundreds have been killed and wounded seeking aid from these sites, which the UN has called a "death trap." The story vividly illustrates the lawlessness and extreme hunger that have taken hold in Gaza after 21 months of war.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have announced the discovery of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru's northern Barranca province. The city is believed to have been a crucial trading hub connecting early coastal communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery sheds light on the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was impacted by climate change. The site, which contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes, has yielded artifacts like clay sculptures and necklaces, highlighting its strategic importance for cultural and economic exchange in the ancient world.</p>

The murder was a pivotal moment in the U.S. war on drugs and led to a massive operation to dismantle the cartel. The tapes are highly sensitive and have been the subject of controversy, with speculation they may contain evidence of a CIA officer's involvement.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis in The Guardian argues that the ongoing destruction in Palestine is causing a collapse of the post-WWII international rules-based order. The article contends that the failure of Western powers to rein in Israel's actions, from bombing hospitals to using starvation as a weapon of war, is eroding foundational principles of international law. This shift is seen domestically as well, with crackdowns on free speech and political dissent on university campuses. The author suggests this hypocrisy has exhausted the current global system, which now prioritizes punishing protestors over preventing potential genocide.</p>

          <p>Despite rising geopolitical and trade tensions at the national level, many local government officials in the United States continue to welcome Chinese investment. According to the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, city leaders are eager for Chinese-invested projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. President Trump's tariffs have also increased the incentive for Chinese companies to establish production facilities within the U.S. for domestic sales. This indicates a significant disconnect between national political rhetoric and the economic priorities of some American cities and states.</p>
