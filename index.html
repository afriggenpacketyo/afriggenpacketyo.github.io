          <p>United Airlines has released a new full-year earnings forecast, with its CEO expressing confidence in a strong finish to 2025 due to stabilizing travel demand. While the airline's second-quarter revenue of $15.24 billion slightly missed expectations, its adjusted earnings per share beat analyst estimates. The company noted that domestic revenue per seat mile fell, reflecting weaker pricing power that has affected the industry. United now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025, narrowing its previous guidance which had accounted for a potential recessionary environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, fell over 20% during their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public debut followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Trump Jr. marked the occasion by ringing the opening bell. He framed the event as a victory against 'woke' culture, highlighting the company's connection to conservative political causes. The newly merged company, trading under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million in gross proceeds from the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency markets rallied following a procedural vote in the U.S. House that revived the possibility of passing key crypto-related legislation this week. Bitcoin and ether saw significant gains, along with stocks of companies like Coinbase and Circle, after previously dipping when the bills were stalled. President Trump indicated that several Republican lawmakers had reversed their opposition, fueling investor optimism for the passage of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act and the broader CLARITY Act. Analysts suggest that passing these bills would reduce market uncertainty and provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has strongly criticized calls from within his own party to release all files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, labeling the controversy a "hoax" designed by Democrats to undermine him. This comes as Attorney General Pam Bondi and the administration face pressure for transparency, particularly after the Justice Department stated it found no evidence of a "client list." House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested Bondi should clarify her previous comments and has not ruled out calling Ghislaine Maxwell to testify. Trump defended Bondi and disavowed supporters focused on the issue, insisting it is a distraction from more important matters.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that a recent Israeli airstrike on Syria's military headquarters in Damascus was likely a misunderstanding amid regional unrest. The strike, which reportedly killed three people, occurred as Israel acted to defend the Druze minority in southwest Syria from perceived threats by Syrian government forces. The incident follows clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups in the region, which is critical to U.S. efforts to stabilize Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. Rubio expressed hope for de-escalation in the coming hours, aligning with the administration's broader goal of fostering peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, tempering earlier reports that he was considering the move. The President acknowledged discussing the possibility with Republican lawmakers but insisted he was not planning to act, unless for reasons of misconduct. This development follows months of public criticism from Trump, who has accused Powell of harming the economy by not lowering interest rates more aggressively.

For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 helped recover the innings after a poor start, but their total proved insufficient.

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to formally adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its anti-discrimination policies. This move is part of the university's efforts to resolve a dispute with the Trump administration, which has frozen $400 million in federal grants over allegations that Columbia failed to protect Jewish students. Critics argue the IHRA definition can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel, but the university insists the step strengthens its commitment to combating antisemitism. The decision follows months of campus turmoil and criticism over the handling of pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has suspended four of its Members of Parliament for breaching party discipline by voting against the government's proposed welfare cuts. The MPs—Rachael Maskell, Olivia Duncan-Jordan, Brian Leishman, and Joe Hinchliff—were part of a larger group of 47 Labour rebels who opposed the bill. The suspended MPs stated they were representing their constituents' interests and could not support measures that would make disabled people poorer. This rebellion has been seen as a challenge to the authority of party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has recently faced criticism for several policy reversals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent rise in the annual inflation rate to 2.7% has sparked concerns about the future direction of credit card interest rates. Since the Federal Reserve uses high interest rates to combat inflation, a continued upward trend in prices could mean the Fed will keep its benchmark rate elevated for longer. Because most credit card APRs are variable and tied to the Fed's rate, consumers could face persistently high or even increasing interest costs on their balances. For now, economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady, but the inflationary pressure adds another layer of financial strain for households. (not investment advice)</p>

These policies generally forbid cooperation with civil immigration enforcement but allow for transfers in criminal cases, such as illegal reentry.

The bill follows several multi-million dollar payments to President Trump's future library from corporations like Paramount and Disney as part of legal settlements.
