          <p>Honda Motor's first-quarter operating profit fell by 50%, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a stronger yen. Despite this, the company's revenue exceeded expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating a weaker yen and a smaller-than-expected tariff impact. While global car sales declined, particularly in China and Europe, the motorcycle division achieved a record quarterly profit, and electric vehicle sales in North America remained strong. The article notes that other Japanese automakers like Nissan are also suffering from these trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The relationship between the United States and India has deteriorated significantly, moving from amicable discussions to a contentious state marked by U.S. tariff threats. President Trump has labeled India the "tariff king" and criticized its oil purchases from Russia, casting doubt on a previously anticipated trade deal. Analysts suggest that while India will prioritize its national interests and not simply yield to U.S. pressure, the trust between the two nations has been damaged. Despite the friction, some experts believe the shared concern over China will prevent a complete breakdown of the strategic partnership.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun broadcasting a new season of "MasterChef" that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following a misconduct investigation. The decision to air the series has drawn criticism from broadcast unions and women's rights groups, who argue that bad behavior should not be rewarded with primetime coverage. In response, the BBC stated it was the "right thing to do" for the contestants, though the episodes have been re-edited to minimize the hosts' presence and one contestant was removed at her own request.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dresden, Germany, have ordered the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people to facilitate the defusal of a 250-kilogram British bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge, a site where another bomb was found earlier in the year. The evacuation zone includes numerous hotels and the city's historic Frauenkirche, a major tourist landmark. This event highlights the lingering dangers of WWII, as unexploded bombs are still regularly found across Germany, requiring large-scale safety operations.</p>

The forecast follows HSBC's announcement of a second-quarter dividend and a $3 billion stock buyback plan. Analysts believe these shareholder returns are secure, as the bank holds a significant capital buffer that can absorb potential impairments from its stake in China's Bank of Communications (Bocom). JPMorgan subsequently raised its price target for HSBC's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In discussing recent trade agreements, President Donald Trump has employed a sports analogy, comparing large investment pledges from Europe and Japan to a "signing bonus" a baseball player receives. He claimed to have secured a "$550 billion signing bonus" from Japan and a $600 billion investment commitment from the European Union, which he stated he could use "for anything I want." When questioned about the specifics or enforceability of these pledges, the president asserted that the alternative for these partners would be facing tariffs as high as 35%, framing the deals as major financial wins for the U.S.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine since President Donald Trump took office in January, despite his pledges to seek a ceasefire. The escalation followed a sharp increase in attacks during the final months of the previous administration. Critics, including Senator Chris Coons, suggest that Trump's temporary pauses on military aid to Ukraine may have emboldened the Kremlin. The analysis corresponds with intelligence indicating Russia has significantly ramped up its domestic production of ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones, increasing pressure on Ukrainian air defenses.</p>

          <p>This article explores why the throw-in remains one of football's most underdeveloped tactical elements, despite the brief era of Rory Delap's famously long throws for Stoke City. It argues that teams could gain a significant advantage by training players to specialize in long, flat throws, similar to how set-piece coaches have revolutionized corners and free-kicks. The analysis highlights that since the offside rule does not apply to throw-ins, there is vast potential for creating set plays and exploiting defensive vulnerabilities. The piece questions the "snobbery" that associates long throws with unsophisticated football, suggesting innovation is long overdue.</p>

His legacy is divisive; while he led Romania's transition to a multi-party system, he was also criticized for using violent "mineriads"—where miners were brought to Bucharest to crush protests—to consolidate his power. Though he later helped save Romania from a far-right ideologue in a 2000 election, he was never held legally accountable for the deaths that occurred during his rise to power.</p>

Experts point to several key obstacles, including the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar. Another factor is the "planet theory," which posits that there is a surplus of athletes with the speed and skill for positions like wide receiver, making it harder to stand out. In contrast, athletes with rare size for lineman positions, like Jordan Mailata, are often given more specialized attention and time to develop.</p>

The U.S. is taking steps to eradicate the parasite in Mexico, but for now, the future remains uncertain for many Mexican ranchers.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Buscarita Roa, one of the last two active members of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, the grandmothers who have spent nearly 50 years searching for children stolen during Argentina's military dictatorship. Roa shares her personal story of her son, daughter-in-law, and 8-month-old granddaughter being "disappeared" in 1978, and the decades-long fight for answers. While she was eventually reunited with her granddaughter in 2000, she vows to continue the search for the nearly 300 grandchildren who remain missing. The Abuelas' legacy is now being carried on by the 140 grandchildren they have successfully found.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man who was wrongly identified as a wanted suspect by the Metropolitan Police's live facial recognition (LFR) technology is bringing a High Court challenge against its use. Shaun Thompson described the experience as intimidating and "stop and search on steroids," and is now pursuing the first legal case of its kind with the support of privacy group Big Brother Watch. The Met Police, which plans to double its use of LFR, maintains the technology is lawful and effective, citing over 1,000 arrests made using it in 2024. The case raises critical questions about privacy, accuracy, and accountability for this intrusive technology.</p>

          <p>Less than three months after lifting long-standing sanctions, the Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country in the world. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts argue the move is symbolically damaging and threatens to restrict foreign investment needed to rebuild the country after 13 years of devastating civil war. Regional experts suggest the tariffs may be a form of political leverage or a "leash" on Syria's new transitional government. The policy creates further instability for an economy on the verge of collapse, undermining international reconstruction and aid efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

The state-backed Guo Wang project appears to be receiving priority access to the country's reliable Long March rockets, having launched three batches of satellites in a single week. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, turning to private rocket companies to deploy their satellites.

The victim, 19-year-old Edward Coristine, was reportedly assaulted by a group of teenagers, leading to two arrests. In a social media post, Trump decried the city's crime rate as "totally out of control" and stated he would "exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City" if the situation does not improve. The threat revives a contentious debate over D.C.'s autonomy, which is governed by a home rule act but ultimately falls under congressional oversight.</p>
