          <p>Luigi Mangione is scheduled for arraignment in New York federal court on charges related to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione is accused of stalking Thompson and fatally shooting him outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel in December 2024. The indictment includes charges of murder through the use of a firearm, a firearms offense, and two counts of stalking, potentially making Mangione eligible for the death penalty. Mangione's lawyers are contesting the government's pursuit of the death penalty, and he also faces state charges to which he has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>China is planning targeted measures to support struggling businesses in response to escalating trade tensions with the United States. President Xi Jinping chaired a Politburo meeting where authorities called for financial support and other measures to aid businesses facing difficulties.

These measures are intended to mitigate the impact of new tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by both Washington and Beijing, as major Wall Street banks have lowered their China GDP forecasts.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales saw their biggest rise in almost four years during the first quarter of the year, driven by warmer weather boosting sales in March. Sales volumes increased by 1.6% between January and March, with garden centers, clothing, and DIY goods experiencing improved demand. However, food sales volumes declined, particularly in supermarkets. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that sales may weaken in the coming months due to a fall in consumer confidence.</p>

Experts suggest open communication and self-reflection as key strategies. In the first scenario, the advice is to express interest in dating rather than immediately attempting a kiss. For the second, the partner needs to advocate for their spouse and set boundaries with their family, and the person experiencing the belittlement needs to be direct about their feelings.</p>

          <p>The funeral of Pope Francis will be held on Saturday in Vatican City, with preparations beginning for the conclave to elect the next Pope. The Pope's body is lying in state inside St Peter's Basilica, and tens of thousands of mourners have paid their respects. The funeral will be simpler than those of his predecessors, and he will be buried in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major, unlike his predecessors who were buried inside the Vatican. World leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, Donald Trump, and Volodymyr Zelensky are expected to attend.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Kyiv has suggested that Ukraine might need to give up land to achieve a temporary peace with Russia. Vitali Klitschko's comments followed a deadly attack on the Ukrainian capital. Meanwhile, Russia's top diplomat has stated that an agreement between his country and the United States on Ukraine still requires some "fine-tuning". Scores more drones were launched overnight into Friday, Ukraine's air force says, with three people reported killed in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region.</p>

          <p>A Dutch town hall admitted to accidentally disposing of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of Queen Beatrix, during renovation works. The artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were "not handled with care", according to investigators. The incident was attributed to a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation, and security of the artworks. The 46 artworks were valued at around €22,000, and the municipality stated that it was unlikely they will ever be found.</p>

This proposal aims to alleviate the burden of persisting inflation and potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has so far resisted changing the consumption tax rate, given his low public support. Other political parties are also considering tax cuts to appeal to voters amid economic concerns.</p>

The treaty, which governed water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin, had survived previous conflicts. The suspension raises concerns about India's ability to withhold or divert water from the western rivers, potentially impacting Pakistan's agriculture and hydropower. Experts suggest that while holding back large volumes of water is difficult, India could exert more control during the dry season.</p>
