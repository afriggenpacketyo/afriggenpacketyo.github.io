          <p>A federal appeals court is examining the legality of President Trump's use of emergency powers to enact widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners. Judges questioned the administration's interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), noting the law does not explicitly mention tariffs and that this application could disrupt the established trade framework set by Congress. The case, brought by states and small businesses, tests a key component of Trump's economic agenda and is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court, carrying significant implications for presidential authority and international trade relations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have solved a long-standing botanical mystery, discovering that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. A study published in the journal *Cell* explains that the potato's ability to form starchy tubers resulted from an ancient hybridization event. A key gene from the tomato ancestor, combined with a gene from a non-tuber-producing wild potato relative, gave the modern potato its signature trait. This finding highlights how interspecies breeding can drive the evolution of new and important characteristics in plants.</p>

          <p>American buyers of European-made yachts are reportedly planning to use legal loopholes to avoid the newly proposed 15% U.S. tariffs. A common strategy involves registering the multimillion-dollar vessels in other countries, such as the Cayman Islands or Malta, which allows the yachts to enter U.S. waters as "visiting vessels" without being officially imported. While this "foreign flagging" strategy involves fees, the savings are substantial on high-value yachts. This maneuver highlights how the wealthiest consumers can often navigate new tax burdens, potentially blunting the intended economic impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," can significantly impact heirs who wish to keep a family home. This rule stipulates that if the loan balance exceeds the home's value, heirs can settle the debt by paying 95% of the property's current appraised value, rather than the full amount owed. This prevents them from being "underwater" on the inheritance. The provision offers peace of mind for senior homeowners, ensuring their loved ones won't face an unmanageable financial burden if they choose to retain the property.</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching for updates on its artificial intelligence initiatives and the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the company has pledged to spend up to $100 billion on AI, its cloud division, AWS, has seen slowing growth, partly due to hardware constraints. Analysts are also keen to learn how President Trump's tariffs are affecting its e-commerce business, though some believe the policies may be inadvertently boosting Amazon by weakening Chinese competitors like Shein and Temu in the U.S. market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may soon face higher prices for European wine and spirits as new U.S. tariffs are set to take effect. A 15% tariff on EU goods and a 10% levy on UK products will likely force importers and distributors to raise their prices, with the costs ultimately passed on to customers. Wine industry experts warn this could lead to reduced consumer choice and negatively impact U.S. businesses, particularly restaurants that rely on the high profit margins of imported wines. Trade groups are lobbying for exemptions, arguing the tariffs will harm both European producers and American jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new investigation has uncovered that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of oil tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The operation involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers turning off their transponders to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which reportedly generates billions for Iran, undermines U.S. foreign policy and efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program. Despite multiple rounds of U.S. sanctions targeting this activity, the investigation found it is only increasing in scale.</p>

The outlook was further clouded by comments from CEO Rene Haas suggesting that Arm is considering a major strategy shift towards designing its own processors, a move away from its traditional business model of licensing chip architecture. Analysts expressed concern that this transition represents a significant leap for the company and will likely lead to a major change in its cost structure, creating uncertainty for investors.

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent medical contrarian recently appointed as the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer, has abruptly resigned from his position. His brief tenure was marked by controversy, as his skeptical stance on drug approval standards and vaccine use clashed with both industry interests and factions within the Trump administration. Prasad's push for more rigorous evidence for new therapies, such as a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, drew sharp criticism. His departure suggests that the administration's regulatory approach continues to prioritize business interests and patient access over stringent scientific review.</p>

However, the government also moved to accelerate a broader tariff increase on EV kits, which will now reach 35% in January 2027. This decision balances short-term relief for the new market entrant with long-term protection for established automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, *Acrophylla alta*, in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest insect in Australia. The newly discovered creature measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an evolutionary adaptation to the colder conditions of its high-altitude habitat. The species remained undiscovered for so long due to its remote location and life high in the forest canopy, with specimens now added to the Queensland Museum for further study.</p>
