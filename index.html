          <p>Elon Musk voiced strong disapproval of the tax-and-spending-cut bill supported by President Trump, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his social media platform, X. Musk argued that the bill would significantly increase the federal budget deficit, potentially burdening American citizens with unsustainable debt. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed Musk's criticism, affirming the administration's support for the bill. Musk's remarks came shortly after an interview where he expressed concerns that the legislative package undermined the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) objectives. </p>

          <p>The White House formally requested Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, targeting foreign aid, NPR, and PBS. The rescission package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS, with the White House stating taxpayers have funded these entities "for too long." Republicans in Congress are eager to act on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) findings to deliver more cuts to big government. The package also seeks $8.3 billion in cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which the administration views as wasteful and pushing "weaponized cultural indoctrination."</p>

          <p>The White House revealed a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing an earlier image that drew comparisons to a mugshot. In the new photograph, Trump is depicted staring directly into the camera, wearing a blue suit with a red tie, against a dark and blank backdrop. Art experts noted the more natural, yet still dramatic, lighting in the new portrait, contrasting with the up lighting used in the previous version. A White House official stated that the initial portrait was always intended as a placeholder, with the new portrait reflecting the "optimism and resolve of America."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with legal action and steep fines over its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports, specifically after a transgender athlete won two high school track-and-field events.

President Trump singled out the athlete in question on Truth Social, promising "large scale fines" for the state.

          <p>Civilians in northern Gaza are facing severe food shortages as aid fails to reach the area, with families surviving on one meal a day and lacking essentials like clean water and cooking gas. Hazem Lubbad, a resident of Gaza City, reports that food has been scarce throughout the war, and recent aid deliveries are not reaching the north. Residents are resorting to desperate measures, such as grinding pasta and lentils to make bread, while prices in the markets have skyrocketed. The United Nations has criticized the limited aid distribution, calling it "engineered scarcity."</p>
