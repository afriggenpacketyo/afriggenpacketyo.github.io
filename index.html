          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," was about the length of an index finger and had a circular mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts. The fossil also showed the creature's open circulatory system, offering valuable information about the diversity of life before the Cambrian explosion. </p>
