          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea is viewed by experts as a carefully orchestrated step towards mending strained ties, despite limited expectations for immediate breakthroughs. His last visit in 2014 led to a free-trade agreement, but subsequent events, including Beijing's omission of "denuclearisation" from a joint statement, raised doubts about arms reduction. This current trip aims to symbolically restart dialogue and rebuild trust between the two nations. The article suggests a cautious optimism for diplomatic progress.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, just before early voting begins. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on affordability and commitment to all New Yorkers as reasons for his support, joining other prominent Democrats. This endorsement comes amidst criticism from Republicans, who label Mamdani as an extreme candidate. The article highlights the competitive nature of the race, with Mamdani's opponent, Andrew Cuomo, also receiving key endorsements.</p>

          <p>Officers opened fire on a U-Haul truck backing into law enforcement personnel outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, amidst protests against an immigration enforcement surge. The driver, who was wounded in the stomach, later returned to the scene and is now in custody, undergoing a mental health evaluation. The incident occurred after the planned immigration crackdown in the Bay Area was reportedly canceled, though protesters remained. The FBI is leading the investigation into the shooting, which saw approximately 20-30 rounds fired.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted clemency to Changpeng Zhao, a prominent cryptocurrency billionaire who pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws. This pardon comes amidst scrutiny, as Zhao's company, Binance, reportedly helped create code for a stablecoin used by a crypto startup co-founded by Trump's sons. The article highlights concerns that Trump's pardons often reward political loyalty or personal financial remuneration, with Zhao having extensively lobbied for clemency. Critics argue this instance exemplifies Trump reshaping the pardon's function for self-interest.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern Scotland, over a million people in the UK experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This article explains SAD as recurring seasonal depression linked to reduced daylight, causing low mood, irritability, and lack of energy.

          <p>A group of UK MPs on the Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue such cuts are unlikely to foster an investment culture and would face opposition from banks and consumers. The article notes Reeves is considering tax rises or spending cuts to address a £22bn budget shortfall, with previous plans to reduce the cash ISA limit to £10,000 having been put on hold. The committee emphasized that while promoting investment is good, this is not the right time for such a measure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in driving preferences, with one in three UK cars now automatic, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. This article explores the dilemma for new drivers choosing between learning in a manual or automatic, noting that an automatic-only license restricts future driving options. Challenges include a scarcity of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs, despite a common misconception that automatic tests are easier.
