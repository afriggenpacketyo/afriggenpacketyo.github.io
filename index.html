          <p>In a trial examining the legality of President Trump's past military deployment in Los Angeles, a high-ranking general testified that he never heard the term 'rebellion' used to justify the action. The lawsuit, brought by California's governor, questions whether the deployment of National Guard troops violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. The general's testimony challenges the administration's legal basis for the federalization of the troops. This trial provides relevant context for the president's more recent deployment of military forces in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of the National Guard to Washington D.C. and has taken federal control of the city's police force. The administration justified the move by describing the city as 'lawless' and 'one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world,' a claim sharply contradicted by official data showing violent crime at a 30-year low. Democratic leaders have condemned the action as a 'disgusting, dangerous' and 'unjustified power grab.' The federal takeover is expected to remain in effect for at least 30 days.</p>

          <p>President Trump and President Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The article explores the rationale behind the choice of Alaska, which the U.S. purchased from Russia in 1867, giving the location historical significance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend, raising concerns that any agreements made without his country's input would be 'dead decisions.' The summit is viewed by Trump as an initial 'feel-out meeting' to urge Putin toward peace, though potential territorial swaps are a point of major contention.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Georgia's Lieutenant Governor, Burt Jones, in the state's 2026 gubernatorial race. The endorsement, announced on Truth Social, is a significant and early move in the Republican primary, providing Jones with a major boost while dealing a blow to his competitor, Attorney General Chris Carr. In his statement, Trump highlighted Jones's unwavering support for his presidential campaigns from the very beginning. This development comes as the two candidates are also engaged in a legal dispute over campaign finance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A state disaster declaration has been issued in the Juneau, Alaska area due to the 'imminent threat of catastrophic flooding.' The danger stems from a potential glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) from Suicide Basin, a part of the Mendenhall Glacier. According to officials, the volume of water in the basin has reached or exceeded levels seen in previous record-setting flood events, and a release could happen at any time. This marks the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding threats for the state capital, prompting the installation of flood control barriers.</p>

The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest decline. Despite the slowdown, average wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged, signaling what economists describe as a 'very gradual cooling' rather than a sharp downturn.

          <p>This report details the profound neglect faced by families of soldiers killed fighting extremist groups in the Sahel region, including Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Bereaved families often learn of their loved ones' deaths through social media and receive no official communication, counseling, or financial support from the ruling military juntas. Analysts suggest the regimes deliberately suppress information about casualties to hide the deteriorating security situation, which they had used as a justification for seizing power. This lack of transparency creates a 'war of narratives' and leaves families in a state of unresolved grief.</p>

The author asserts that Democrats are likely to lose a 'gerrymandering arms race' due to the geographic distribution of their voters and that such actions would violate core democratic principles. Citing historical examples, the piece warns that using anti-democratic means to defend democracy often backfires and erodes the very norms they claim to protect.

The potential deal would involve reducing the chip's performance by 30-50% and comes after Nvidia agreed to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from other chip sales to China.

          <p>In a joint statement, leaders from 26 of the 27 EU member states have warned against redrawing Ukraine's borders by force. The declaration, issued just before the US-Russia summit, underscores European nervousness about a potential peace deal that could legitimize Russian territorial gains. It stresses that Ukraine must be free to decide its own future and that its territorial integrity must be respected. The statement reflects a deep-seated European concern that allowing borders to be changed through conflict could set a dangerous precedent for the continent's security.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats is expected to surpass 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in the UK last summer. The milestone has drawn sharp criticism from the Conservative opposition, who accuse the government of overseeing an 'illegal immigration crisis.' A government minister acknowledged the number was 'unacceptable' but pointed to a new 'one in, one out' returns agreement with France as a key part of their strategy to deter people-smuggling gangs and manage the crossings.</p>

          <p>The Farmers' Almanac has released its long-range forecast for the 2025-2026 winter, predicting a return to an 'old-fashioned' season with 'dramatic swings and widespread wintry weather.' The theme for the season is 'Chill, Snow, Repeat,' with most of the country expected to experience cold or very cold temperatures. For the Southeast, including Tennessee, the almanac predicts average winter temperatures but with numerous wet periods. The publication uses a proprietary formula based on factors like solar patterns and historical data to make its popular, though often debated, predictions.</p>

His death highlights the escalating violence and vulnerability of Palestinian communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where settler attacks have sharply increased.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential risks of UFC President Dana White's close political alignment with Donald Trump for the mixed martial arts organization. It argues that while the UFC's core demographic has leaned towards Trump, the sport's roster and fanbase are increasingly global and diverse, potentially alienating many. The piece questions the long-term wisdom of this affiliation, especially as the UFC signs a new $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount aimed at broader accessibility. It suggests the tight bond with a polarizing political figure could be a liability for the brand's global ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Swiss sportswear company On has raised its full-year revenue guidance after reporting a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, beating Wall Street estimates. The popular sneaker brand, which has been gaining market share from competitors, now expects higher annual sales and an improved gross margin. This strong performance comes despite the company raising prices to offset new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources about 90% of its products. The company stated it has not seen a slowdown in consumer demand following the price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will be ending its dial-up internet service, a technology synonymous with the early days of the web in the 1990s. The service, known for its distinctive series of beeps and static noises during connection, will cease operations on September 30. Dial-up played a crucial role in closing the 'digital divide' by using existing phone lines, and AOL's free trial CDs became a ubiquitous part of American culture. While largely replaced by broadband, a very small percentage of households in rural areas still relied on the service.</p>

          <p>A diverse and unlikely coalition, including commercial shrimpers, environmental groups, and Republican officials, is fighting a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project in Alabama. They are lobbying Congress to ban the practice of dumping material dredged from the Mobile ship channel back into other parts of Mobile Bay. Opponents argue the disposal method is choking the estuary, harming the local seafood industry, and destroying habitats. The Corps maintains that keeping the sediment within the bay is environmentally beneficial and necessary for maintaining the crucial shipping channel.</p>

The article highlights the lack of clear plans for where these individuals will go, with many fearing it will cause more harm than good.

A massive mudslide, triggered by heavy rains, submerged nearly half of Dharali village and damaged a nearby army camp. So far, only one body has been recovered from the disaster site. The rescue work has been hampered by continued inclement weather and a blocked highway, as workers use helicopters and manually dig through debris to search for survivors.</p>
