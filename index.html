          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on Israel and Iran to de-escalate their conflict and offered Beijing's assistance in restoring peace. Xi emphasized that all parties should work to avoid further escalation, as military conflict is not the solution. He stated China's opposition to actions infringing on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. Meanwhile, Beijing has initiated the evacuation of Chinese nationals from Iran and Israel due to growing concerns about regional conflict, with some being moved to neighboring countries, according to a foreign ministry spokesman.

          <p>President Trump has denied reports of reaching out to Iran for a ceasefire, stating he is "not too much in the mood" to negotiate and that Tehran should have accepted a previous deal. These comments followed Trump's early return to the White House from the G7 summit for a meeting with his national security staff. Trump also warned Iran against targeting U.S. troops and assets in the region, promising a strong response. Israel began aerial strikes on Iran, citing efforts to create nuclear weapons as the reason, and Trump dismissed claims that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon.

          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company focused on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments for ADHD and autism, has seen its stock more than triple, leading to a market capitalization nearing $30 billion.

Regencell's stock surge coincides with increased attention on alternative medicines, following Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointment as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

          <p>A study by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) reveals that 26% of immigrants in Germany have considered leaving, with 3% having concrete plans to emigrate. The study found that those with higher education, better German language skills, and economic success are more likely to consider leaving. Reasons for emigration include family, better career opportunities, high taxes, bureaucracy, and experiences of discrimination. The political atmosphere in Germany, marked by debates on migration, also contributes to the feeling of being unwelcome, increasing the likelihood of emigration.</p>

Trump attributed this to his personal affinity for the UK, stating that he likes them. This relationship is notable given the differing political backgrounds of Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Cultural links, Trump's Anglophilia, and the UK's avoidance of trade or foreign policy conflicts with Washington have contributed to this preferential relationship.</p>

Analysts point to the lack of local manufacturing capabilities and the likelihood that a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM) would handle the design and production. The phone, which will run Google's Android operating system and retail for $499, has raised questions about the feasibility of domestic production. This follows Trump's previous calls for Apple to manufacture its iPhones in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new study from WalletHub identifies Provo, Utah, as the best-run city in the U.S., based on an analysis of 148 of the nation's largest cities. The rankings are determined by assessing the quality of services across public finances, education, health, safety, and infrastructure, compared against each city's per-capita budget. Provo's high ranking is attributed to factors such as robust business growth, a high school graduation rate, and low violent crime rates. Nampa, Idaho, and Manchester, New Hampshire, followed Provo in the rankings.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran presents a challenge for China, testing its role as a neutral mediator. Beijing, with close ties to both Russia and Iran, faces a precarious position amid rising global tensions. China reacted to Israel's strikes on Iranian targets by framing Israel as the aggressor and voicing support for Iran's right to self-defense. The Chinese embassy in Israel has issued safety advisories and evacuation guidance to its nationals, reflecting the complexities of balancing geopolitics with domestic priorities.</p>

The bill includes a provision to fully phase out solar and wind power tax incentives by 2028, while preserving incentives for nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy. This contrasts with the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which heavily supported renewable energy incentives. Analysts note that while the Senate proposal is less severe than the House version, it still represents a negative for renewable energy investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's deportation numbers are lower than those of President Obama, despite Trump's promise of a large-scale deportation program. Obama holds the 21st-century deportation record, due to a two-pronged strategy: increasing penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement. Trump faces challenges in replicating Obama's strategy, including fewer border crossings and increased opposition to cooperating with federal immigration authorities. While deportations have increased recently, it remains uncertain whether Trump can maintain that momentum.</p>

          <p>Experts have cast doubt on the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed smartphone can be entirely manufactured in the US. One industry analyst told the BBC it would be "virtually impossible" for the gold-coloured handset - which will retail at $499 (Â£367.50) - to be built in the United States. The Trump family has not said which company would manufacture its phone in the United States.</p>

          <p>Russia has carried out a mass missile and drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 100 others, officials say. A drone smashed into an apartment block, destroying dozens of flats and Ukraine's interior minister said the country had been hit by 440 drones and 32 missiles. The attack overnight into Tuesday was among the biggest on the capital since the start of Russia's full-scale war and President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was "one of the most terrifying strikes".</p>

          <p>A man in Osaka Prefecture has been arrested for allegedly selling a pirated version of the 1954 black-and-white film "Godzilla," which he apparently colorized using artificial intelligence, police said Tuesday. Ippei Miyamoto, a 66-year-old part-time worker, is accused of having sold the DVD -- which features the iconic fire-breathing, city-stomping giant reptilian monster -- for 2,980 yen ($21) to a man in Tokyo last November.</p>
