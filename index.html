          <h2>Nazis Used Sport as a Tool for Ideology and Propaganda</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 06:56:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article discusses the significance of sport under the Nazi regime, where it was used as a means of physical education to promote health, performance, and military readiness. Individual sports were secondary to collective activities that emphasized strength and fortitude, aligning with Nazi ideology. The Nazis initially rejected international competitive sport but later recognized the opportunity presented by the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin to showcase themselves as a peace-loving and organized state. The article further examines the types of physical exercises for women and girls and the exclusion of Jews from sports clubs after the passing of the "Aryan paragraph" in 1933. </p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will no longer be allowed to compete in women's football in England starting June 1st. This decision comes after the UK Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. The FA has amended its rules to apply stricter eligibility criteria, permitting only those born biologically female to participate in women's football at all levels, scrapping a previous policy after the Supreme Court's ruling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a Stoke-on-Trent firm known for its colorful pottery, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The directors attributed the closure to increased energy costs and falling sales, which industry commentators echoed. The company had warned of possible redundancies in March due to rising costs. The closure of Moorcroft is a blow to Stoke-on-Trent's pottery industry, which has seen several firms collapse in recent years, prompting calls for government support to address issues like carbon taxes and high energy costs.</p>

          <p>After months of negotiations, Ukraine has signed a deal granting the United States control over a share of its future revenue from natural resources. The agreement, which involves creating a joint investment fund, aims to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine’s fate and address his concerns about unchecked U.S. aid. The deal removes the idea of treating American aid given during the war as debt, and it keeps the door open for Ukraine to eventually join the European Union. However, the agreement does not include security guarantees that Ukraine had sought.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk described his first 100 days leading the Department of Government Efficiency as "very, very intense," acknowledging that progress hasn't been as effective as he'd like due to "an entrenched set of interests." Musk claims that reaching the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal depends on the cabinet and Congress's tolerance for pain. He described the federal bureaucracy's default as spending what they did last year plus 5% indefinitely. Musk says he is making as much progress as he can but is making a lot of enemies and not that many friends.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates and raised its full-year guidance, reflecting some improvement in its insurance business. The company expects adjusted earnings of $6 to $6.20 per share, up from a previous guidance of $5.75 to $6 per share. The insurer, Aetna, showed signs of improvement, with its medical benefit ratio decreasing to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier, reflecting stronger underlying performance in its Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year. CEO David Joyner said the company is watching for the potential impact from President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S.</p>

          <p>The loss of editorial freedom at CBS's 60 Minutes is highlighted as a concerning development for US media. Executive producer Bill Owens stepped down due to a lack of editorial independence, attributed to corporate interference as Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger. Correspondent Scott Pelley publicly stated that Paramount began supervising content in new ways, raising concerns about the show's trustworthiness. The situation is linked to Trump's desire to control the media and his administration's actions against CBS.</p>

Importers hope to buy time until tariff tensions ease. However, only a small fraction of industrial property in the region is bonded. Warehouse operators who want to get their buildings bonded face a lengthy application process. The overall demand for warehouses is expected to fall as tariffs take effect.</p>

Starbucks contends that it already offers competitive pay and benefits, while the union argues that the proposal does not provide economic justice to its workers.
