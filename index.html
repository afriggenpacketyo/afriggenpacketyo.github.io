            <p>America First Legal (AFL) has made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice regarding Deerfield Public Schools 109 in Illinois, alleging violations of federal and state law related to transgender policies. The referral stems from allegations that the school district forced middle school girls to change in the same locker room as a transgender student. AFL claims the district violated the "Conspiracy against rights" statute, potentially infringing on students' First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights has already launched an investigation into the district over reported Title IX violations, following a complaint from a parent.</p>

            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply after the U.S. announced it would impose a 104% tariff on China, reversing earlier gains fueled by hopes of tariff negotiations. This sell-off adds to a multi-day market decline driven by anxieties about the economic impact of reciprocal tariffs, with economists warning of potential inflation and recession risks. Despite initial optimism sparked by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments on potential deals, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt confirmed the implementation of the steep levies. Corporate earnings season is underway, with the airline and banking sectors closely watched amid rising global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore access for Associated Press (AP) journalists to presidential events after the White House blocked the news agency over a dispute regarding the term "Gulf of America." District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that restricting AP journalists was "contrary to the First Amendment," guaranteeing freedom of speech. The dispute arose when the AP refused to adopt the administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The judge's ruling was welcomed by press freedom organizations, emphasizing the importance of a free press without government retaliation.</p>

            <p>The State Department has initiated significant cuts to foreign aid, totaling over $1.3 billion, which includes terminating USAID contracts supporting food, water, and medicine delivery in Afghanistan and Yemen.

Critics argue these cuts could result in a "death sentence for millions," while the State Department claims that most USAID programs with the WFP remain active.

            <p>The UK government is investigating the green fuel HVO diesel amid claims that it contains virgin palm oil fraudulently relabeled as waste materials. Industry whistleblowers suggest that virgin palm oil, linked to deforestation, is being used instead of waste sources like used cooking oil. Data analysis indicates that Europe used more palm sludge waste in biofuels than the world is thought to produce, raising concerns about the sustainability of HVO. The Department for Transport is gathering information, while the biofuel industry acknowledges a need for improved certification verification.

            <p>New Social Security rules will require Americans seeking retirement or survivor benefits to apply online or in person, eliminating the option to apply over the phone. A report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) suggests this change will create significant hurdles for millions of seniors, particularly those in rural areas. Advocates argue that the new policy will disproportionately affect bereaved individuals applying for survivor benefits, as there is no online option for this service. Agency officials say the measures will safeguard against fraudulent activity, but critics contend they will create barriers to services for many eligible individuals.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian forces claim to have captured two Chinese nationals fighting for the Russian army in the Donetsk region. President Zelensky stated that intelligence suggests a larger number of Chinese soldiers are involved. Ukraine's Foreign Minister condemned Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens and summoned China's envoy for an explanation. The US State Department called the reports "disturbing," citing China's support for Russia's war through dual-use goods. While Beijing and Moscow maintain close ties, China has attempted to portray itself as a neutral party in the conflict.</p>

The discussions, to be held in Oman, have been described by Iranian officials as indirect high-level talks, a characterization the White House disputes.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has stated that the measles outbreak in western Texas is slowing down, but data and public health officials suggest otherwise. Kennedy claimed that the growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened since early March, but data from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) indicates that cases are still increasing. Public health specialists express skepticism and believe the number of cases is likely higher than the official count. The DSHS says any cases reported after March 16 are incomplete, and additional cases may be reported.</p>

Judge Trevor McFadden stated that the exclusion violated the First Amendment. The AP expressed gratitude for the court's decision, affirming the importance of a free press.</p>

Internal administration documents suggest that representatives from the "department of government efficiency" were involved in deciding which funding programs to cut.
