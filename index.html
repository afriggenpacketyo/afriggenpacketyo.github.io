          <p>Tuesday's newspaper headlines are dominated by the Casey report on grooming gangs, with many papers highlighting the report's findings of systemic failures by authorities and a "conspiracy of silence over race." Several papers feature interviews with victims and pledges from the Home Secretary to review cases. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran is also a major focus, with reports of Israeli strikes and evacuation orders. Additionally, the Daily Star predicts a hosepipe ban in Yorkshire due to drought conditions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump touted a tariffs agreement with the UK at the G7 summit, displaying the deal alongside Prime Minister Starmer. The agreement removes tariffs on the aerospace industry and imposes a 10% levy on the car industry, averting potential job losses. While the UK is exempt from the global 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding proof of origin. The deal also includes reciprocal access to beef sales between the two countries; this agreement is an achievement for the Prime Minister on the international stage despite Trump's unorthodox approach. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it would slow the pace of government bond purchases starting April of next year, while holding the benchmark rate at 0.5%. The decision, which aligns with economist expectations, signals concerns about economic growth amid persistent inflation. The central bank aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets while maintaining stability. Japan's economy faces uncertainty, with inflation remaining above the BOJ's target for three years and GDP shrinking recently due to declining exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District will sell up to $500 million in bonds to address approximately 370 sexual abuse claims dating back to the 1970s.

The move comes in response to Assembly Bill 218, which opened a window for adults to file lawsuits over childhood sexual assault. The district has also established its own insurance company to manage future claims, balancing justice for victims with financial responsibility to current students.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Higher Education Policies May Undervalue Faith-Based Institutions</h2>

          <p>A recent opinion piece discusses the potential impact of the "big, beautiful bill" on higher education, particularly for faith-based institutions. The bill aims to modernize higher education policy but may undervalue the unique missions of faith-based colleges by focusing primarily on graduates' economic potential. The author argues that these policies could penalize institutions that encourage graduates to pursue service-oriented careers driven by religious convictions. A more holistic approach is needed to assess the value of higher education beyond economic metrics.</p>

Japan has been urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy, but a quick deal is unlikely at the expense of national interests. (not investment advice)</p>
