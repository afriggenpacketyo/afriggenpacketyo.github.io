          <p>Hurricane Iona has formed in the central Pacific, becoming the first hurricane of the season in that region. The storm rapidly intensified from a tropical depression and is currently a Category 1 hurricane, expected to strengthen to Category 2 before gradually weakening. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center express high confidence that Iona will remain well south of the Hawaiian Islands as it moves westward. This development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several major storms.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator, the CAAC, is surveying national airlines about their future fleet needs, specifically inquiring about overdue orders for Boeing aircraft. This move suggests a potential thaw in trade relations, where increased aircraft purchases could be part of a broader deal with the United States. A recent high-level meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice-president also signaled a desire for expanded cooperation. Boeing has often been affected by bilateral tensions, but it stands to benefit significantly if diplomatic and trade ties improve.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by Azoria Capital, an investment fund led by a Donald Trump ally, which sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge questioned whether the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund, a claim the plaintiff's lawyer denied. The suit alleged the Fed was keeping rates high to undermine Trump's economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

In addition, the EU has committed to significantly increasing its purchases of U.S. energy and making substantial investments.

          <p>A recent bipartisan meeting of the National Governors Association in Colorado highlighted the growing split among state leaders on how to interact with and handle President Donald Trump. The event, ostensibly focused on public policy, saw the attendance of administration officials like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz. The gathering underscored the political tightrope many governors, both Republican and Democrat, must walk in their relationship with the White House. The differing approaches reflect the broader national polarization surrounding the president's leadership and policies.</p>

          <p>An analysis of CEO Brian Niccol's tenure at Starbucks suggests the coffee giant presents a more complex turnaround challenge than his highly successful revival of Chipotle. While Niccol quickly fixed Chipotle's food-safety crisis, Starbucks faces a host of issues including operational bottlenecks from mobile orders, labor unrest, and intense competition in China. Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" plan involves significant investments in labor and service improvements, but the company's stock has underperformed since he took over. Investors are looking for more tangible signs of progress in the upcoming earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks one of the first times major voices within Israeli society have leveled such a strong accusation against the state. The Israeli government has dismissed the allegation as "baseless."</p>

          <p>According to a tariff simulation model, exports from China to the U.S. are projected to decrease by as much as $485 billion by 2027 due to current and potential future tariffs. The forecast from Datawheel's OEC Tariff Simulator suggests this will cause a major rewiring of global trade relationships. While trade with China and its manufacturing-linked partners like Vietnam is expected to fall, imports from Canada, Mexico, and the UK are predicted to rise. The model also forecasts a significant $101 billion decline in U.S. exports to China over the same period. (not investment advice)</p>
