        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with a vote on a tax bill containing President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, but internal disagreements persist, casting doubt on its passage. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledges the need for further negotiations to address concerns over state and local tax deductions (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Conservative hardliners and moderates remain divided on these issues, while President Trump pressures Republicans to unite behind the bill. The legislation faces potential resistance in the Senate, adding urgency to address the debt limit by mid-July to avoid potential inability to pay bills.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that associates of President Trump and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are re-entering the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) market. SPACs, which allow companies to go public quickly without a business plan, experienced a boom during the pandemic but faced scrutiny and investor losses. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are involved in new SPAC deals, targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. Brandon Lutnick, son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is also active in the market, with Cantor Fitzgerald taking multiple SPACs public. These deals are attracting investors seeking quick gains in the crypto space, but they remain speculative and risky investments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings from its platform due to violations of housing regulations, as reported in this New York Times article. The government aims to alleviate a severe housing crisis where rising prices outpace wages, pushing families from their homes. Consumer Affairs Minister Pablo Bustinduy emphasizes that the right to housing takes precedence over economic interests. Airbnb argues that the crisis stems from a lack of housing supply, while the government pursues measures to build affordable housing and curb foreign real estate investors. The move reflects broader European efforts to address housing affordability amid rising tourism and investment.</p>

Witnesses reported that the ship lost power before the crash, causing all three masts to snap off, resulting in two fatalities and 19 injuries.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Economist questions Joe Biden's mental acuity and details revelations from books about his presidency. These books suggest that Biden did not hold formal meetings to discuss his re-election bid, was not informed of his public standing by pollsters, and had limited contact with cabinet secretaries. Additionally, the article points to instances of Biden dining early and retiring to his private quarters by 5:15 PM, as well as skipping briefings to undergo makeup sessions. The author suggests that these actions might be better explained by a decline in cognitive abilities rather than vanity, hubris, or incompetence.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article discusses borrowing options for homeowners with 100% home equity, noting that alternatives like home equity loans and HELOCs are attractive due to high interest rates on personal loans and credit cards. While lenders typically limit borrowing to 80-90% of a home's value, having 100% equity positions homeowners for better rates and terms. The choice between a HELOC and a home equity loan depends on individual preferences and the interest rate environment, with HELOCs offering variable rates and interest-only payments during the draw period, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates (not investment advice).</p>

The author argues that the dismantling of the nation's early-alert system is a dangerous gamble, depriving citizens of vital time to seek safety from catastrophic weather events.

          <p>President Trump is set to sign the Take It Down Act, a bill that would make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual intimate imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. The bill, championed by First Lady Melania Trump, imposes penalties of up to three years in prison for sharing such images involving minors and two years for those involving adults. It requires social media companies to remove the content within 48 hours of notice from the victim. The first lady has emphasized the importance of online safety and protecting young people from exploitation and harm.</p>

          <p>Britain and Iran have summoned each other's envoys after three Iranian men were charged with spying in the UK. The Iranian men, who had claimed asylum, are accused of conducting surveillance to locate journalists associated with Iran International, a media outlet critical of the Iranian regime. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that the UK will not tolerate state-backed threats and is drafting new powers to restrict the activity of foreign state-backed organizations.

          <p>Israel has announced the acquisition of documents and personal effects from Syria that belonged to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in 1965. The trove includes documents, photographs, personal artifacts, and handwritten letters from Cohen's time undercover in Syria during the early 1960s. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that the Mossad worked with an allied foreign government to retrieve the archives. Cohen's intelligence work is credited with helping Israel achieve victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The announcement was received as a unifying moment in Israel amid divisions between Netanyahu and the country‚Äôs intelligence services.</p>

The past few days have been particularly deadly for Palestinians in Gaza, which has been devastated by the war and a recent blockade on aid. The Israeli military says it takes measures to avoid harming civilians, such as using ‚Äúprecise munitions‚Äù and warning ahead of some strikes.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is replacing its CEO, Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, as its weight loss drug Wegovy loses ground to Eli Lilly's Zepbound, according to this CNBC article. The company aims to regain its edge in the weight loss drug market, which is expected to reach over $150 billion by the early 2030s. The new CEO will need to launch new weight loss drugs before Wegovy's patents expire, manage Medicare drug price negotiations, and address potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Novo Nordisk's shares have declined as Eli Lilly gained market share and clinical trial data for its next-generation drugs disappointed investors.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article explores whether tax relief programs can help with past-due IRS debt, stating that tax relief can be a powerful tool for resolving overdue debt. The IRS offers programs such as Offers in Compromise, installment agreements, and Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status. While these programs can reduce the total amount owed, pause collection efforts, or make payments more manageable, success depends on individual financial circumstances and compliance with tax obligations. The article also warns about potential scams and the importance of staying compliant to avoid voiding the relief arrangement (not investment advice).</p>

Dan's opponent, George Simion, was a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic. Simion's "Romania first" rhetoric and promises of a better life appealed to some voters, while others feared his policies. Dan's victory is also seen as a strike against Moscow's meddling, as he represents a future firmly within Europe.</p>

The court's order was brief and unsigned, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting. The justices also clarified that they would preserve the ability of individual immigrants to bring legal challenges in some instances, including if the government tried to cancel their work permits. This decision reverses a previous ruling by a federal judge that had blocked the administration‚Äôs efforts to remove the protections.</p>
