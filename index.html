        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising tensions following a deadly attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes on what it claims were terrorist camps in Pakistan, resulting in casualties and escalating regional conflict. The Indian government stated the strikes targeted nine sites, while Pakistani officials reported over 20 deaths and vowed retaliation. The cross-border strikes mark a significant escalation, prompting concerns from global leaders about regional stability. At least two aircraft have reportedly crashed, one on each side of the border, but details remain unconfirmed, increasing worries about further conflict between the two nuclear powers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brendan Buck, writing for the New York Times Opinion section, argues that congressional Republicans are banking on a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political fortunes, particularly by extending the 2017 tax law. Buck, a former aide to House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, contends that the tax bill is unlikely to offset the economic damage caused by President Trump's tariffs. He suggests that Republican leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policies to provide a more stable economic footing for House members facing re-election, since voters may not reward them for the tax cuts alone. The author states that the coming weeks will be crucial in determining what Republicans can offer voters to justify their unified control of Washington.</p>

          <p>A recent UCSF study has found that psilocybin, the psychedelic compound in "magic mushrooms," may improve mood, cognition, and motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients. The small study, involving 12 participants with mild to moderate Parkinson's, showed clinically significant improvements in mood, anxiety, and motor function up to three months after psilocybin administration. Lead study author Dr. Ellen Bradley recommends caution, emphasizing that this is early research and psilocybin may not be safe for all Parkinson's patients. Further research is underway to rigorously test psilocybin's effectiveness and understand its mechanisms of action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that German firms operating in China are feeling the effects of US tariffs on Chinese goods. However, the impact is primarily indirect, affecting their economic outlook rather than their direct operations, due to their focus on serving the Chinese domestic market. The "in China for China" strategy, adopted by many foreign firms, has helped insulate them from direct exposure to US trade policies. Despite the challenges posed by tariffs, German firms' investment plans in China remain largely unchanged.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers are considering cutting Medicaid spending, including taxes hospitals pay, to fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts. These provider taxes help states fund their share of Medicaid and draw additional federal dollars. Eliminating these taxes could save the federal government billions but would negatively impact hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, which rely on Medicaid funding to stay afloat. The proposed cuts have sparked controversy, with critics arguing they would harm low-income individuals and disabled people who depend on Medicaid for health coverage.</p>

While about half of the states currently permit community colleges to offer four-year degrees, opposition from traditional universities, concerned about declining enrollment, often presents a challenge.

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to the implementation of tariffs. The company, which imports approximately 90% of its bikes from China, has seen a significant increase in import duties and tariffs. The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May. The tariffs are rendering manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. financially untenable.</p>

          <p>The minimum age to become a train driver in the UK has been lowered from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages. The government hopes this change will attract younger recruits and improve rail services. The average age of a UK train driver is 48, with a significant portion nearing retirement age. Union Aslef supports the move, noting it will open opportunities for school and college leavers. Research indicates that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers.</p>

          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India launched strikes against Pakistan, escalating the conflict between the two nations. Indian officials said their forces struck nine sites in Pakistan and on Pakistan’s side of the disputed Kashmir region, while Pakistani military officials said that more than 20 people had been killed and dozens injured after six places were hit on the Pakistani side of Kashmir and in Punjab Province. Residents of the Indian side of Kashmir said at least 10 people had been killed in shelling from the Pakistani side since India carried out its strikes. At least two aircraft were reported to have gone down in India and the Indian-controlled side of Kashmir. After the attacks, India was bracing for a response from Pakistan, its neighbor and nemesis for more than seven decades.</p>

          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes that criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison. The legislation aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and to provide some measure of justice to victims' families. The proposed measures would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court due to disruptive behavior. The families of victims whose killers refused to attend sentencing have voiced their support for the bill.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of monetary policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to mitigate the impact of the trade war with the United States. The measures, intended to stabilize markets and encourage economic activity, come shortly after the announcement that U.S. and Chinese officials will hold trade talks in Geneva. However, some analysts believe the impact of these policies will be modest, as banks may face weak demand from borrowers. The central bank is carrying out a “moderately loose” monetary policy in the face of a global economy “full of uncertainties, with intensified economic fragmentation and trade tensions disrupting global industry and supply chains.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a provision in its new trade deal with India that exempts Indian workers on short-term visas from National Insurance (NI) contributions for up to three years. Opposition parties argue this could disadvantage British workers by making Indian labor cheaper. The government insists that it would not tolerate any trade agreement that undercuts British workers and that the exemption is a standard part of international trade agreements. The Conservative leader claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains "two-tier taxes" which would cost the UK "hundreds of millions".</p>

Despite the teenagers' claim of collecting the ants as a hobby, the court emphasized the high value of the particular ant species and the large quantity involved. The Kenya Wildlife Service condemned the illegal export, highlighting its negative impact on the country's biodiversity and potential economic benefits.</p>

The plan proposes banning new gas contracts with Russian suppliers by the end of 2025 and phasing out all remaining imports by 2027.
