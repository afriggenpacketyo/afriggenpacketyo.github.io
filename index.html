          <p>Under the Trump administration, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are wielding unprecedented influence over US national security. Their companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, are playing critical roles in spy satellite operations, potentially making the intelligence community beholden to them. This shift marks a radical change in US spy operations, traditionally controlled by career government officials and established defense contractors. The trend raises concerns about the concentration of power and the potential for conflicts of interest.</p>
