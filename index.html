          <p>India claimed to have intercepted drones and missiles fired by Pakistan, targeting military sites and destroying an air defense system in Lahore, while Pakistan accused India of sending Israeli-made drones and retaliated. The conflict follows recent Indian aerial attacks on Pakistan, prompted by a deadly terror attack in Kashmir that India blamed on Pakistan, which Pakistan denied. Both countries' leaders have convened meetings to discuss national preparedness, with the Pakistani prime minister praising his country's military. Amidst the escalating tensions, at least 16 people have been killed in India, raising concerns about further conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, awaiting the full impact of President Trump's trade war on the U.S. economy. Despite calls for a rate reduction, the Fed maintained the benchmark borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, with policymakers closely monitoring signs of increased pressure on prices or a weakening job market. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cited the economy's solid shape as a reason for not feeling an urgency to cut rates. This decision comes as the Trump administration continues to navigate trade negotiations with various countries, facing both opportunities and uncertainties in the global economic landscape.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to fall back to Earth uncontrolled, with experts estimating reentry around May 10. The spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a malfunction. While most of it fell back within a decade, the landing capsule has been circling the globe for 53 years and could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude. Experts suggest the risk to humans is low, comparable to a random meteorite fall, but caution that space debris crashing back to Earth could pose a growing problem for aircraft.</p>

          <p>The House is scheduled to vote on a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America,' codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill faces opposition from some Republicans, who deem it a waste of taxpayer dollars. Democrats criticize the effort as Congress should focus on more pressing issues. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that updating federal documents and maps would cost less than $500,000 over five years.</p>

          <p>While e-cigarettes may offer a safer alternative for smokers seeking to quit, they also pose a new public health risk, particularly for young people who never smoked.

The article explores the debate over whether vaping is a net improvement overall and the challenges of regulating the industry. Experts disagree on the best approach, with some advocating for strict restrictions and others prioritizing harm reduction.</p>

          <p>A movement to allow single-stair apartment buildings in the U.S. is gaining momentum, challenging long-held building codes. Advocates argue that modernizing codes to permit single-stair construction could unleash more affordable housing. The change could cut costs, encourage the construction of “missing middle” housing, and make family-friendly unit layouts more viable. The proposal faces resistance from fire safety officials, who prioritize safety protocols like double stairwells.</p>
