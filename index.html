        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 43-year-old mother with advanced colorectal cancer alleges that delays in her treatment are due to cuts made to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by the Trump administration. Natalie Phelps, who is participating in an NIH clinical trial involving cell-based immunotherapy, says her treatment start date was pushed back due to staff reductions. Phelps' story has gained attention, leading to a dispute between a Democratic senator and the U.S. health secretary during a congressional hearing. While the HHS claims there have been no cuts to clinical trials, Phelps' doctor confirmed that staffing cuts have caused delays for multiple patients. The author's tone is somber, reflecting the gravity of the situation and the emotional toll on Phelps and her family. The score should reflect the somber tone and the life-threatening implications of the situation.</p>

          <p>University of Texas football coach Steve Sarkisian refuted claims that the program spent $40 million to build its roster, calling the reports "irresponsible." Sarkisian acknowledged that substantial financial resources are allocated to college football programs due to name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing. He suggested that $25 million was a more accurate figure for Texas' investment, emphasizing that other schools are also spending significant amounts to acquire players. Sarkisian's remarks come amid discussions about the financial landscape of college football and the increasing costs associated with maintaining a competitive team. The article is matter-of-fact, focusing on the coach's denial and the broader context of college football spending. The tone is relatively neutral, as it is focused on reporting Sarkisian's statements and the surrounding context.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing the leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to ongoing dissatisfaction within the White House regarding the agency's arrest and deportation numbers. Kenneth Genalo, the head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, and Robert Hammer, who led ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, has been reassigned. The changes are portrayed by ICE as a realignment to support its increasing operational tempo, with the agency aiming to increase arrests of migrants living in the U.S. illegally. The White House is reportedly pushing ICE to make a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day, a target that would significantly expand immigration enforcement. The article conveys a sense of political pressure and shifting priorities within ICE.</p>
