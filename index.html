        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% to bolster the domestic steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Trump stated that $14 billion would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, promising no layoffs or outsourcing and a $5,000 bonus for every US steelworker. While a local union member expressed optimism, economists warn that Trump's tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos and worsened relations between the U.S. and other countries, especially China. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million bees overturned in northwestern Washington state, resulting in the release of the insects. Authorities are urging people to avoid the area to prevent swarming, while bee experts are assisting with the clean-up. The goal is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee, saving as many as possible. Honeybees play a key role in pollination and food production, pollinating over 100 crops, and their decline due to insecticides, parasites, climate change, and lack of food supply poses a threat to agriculture and food security.</p>

          <p>An off-duty NYPD rookie officer was brutally assaulted in the Bronx, prompting discussions about use-of-force policies and officer safety. The officer's brother stated that the suspects escalated the assault upon discovering he was a police officer, leading to severe injuries. Retired NYPD Det. Robert Garland called for justice and urged the department to proactively protect officers, raising concerns that current use-of-force protocols may dissuade officers from protecting themselves. The incident has sparked concerns about the safety of law enforcement and the impact of current policies on potential recruits.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Nippon Steel Corp. for its commitment to invest $14 billion in United States Steel Corp. and protect American jobs. Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump called the Japanese company a "great partner" and announced he will raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will maintain all its existing operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years, and that the deal will ensure all U.S. Steel workers keep their jobs and all the company's facilities in the country remain open and thriving. Trump's remarks came after he unexpectedly indicated that Nippon Steel's blocked bid to take over U.S. Steel had been cleared.</p>

          <p>An appeals court denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, upholding a California judge's order to halt the downsizing of the federal workforce. The appeals court stated that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston, who questioned whether the administration was acting lawfully in trying to pare the federal workforce. The judge's order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management.</p>

          <p>California Governor Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, potentially causing millions to lose eligibility. The proposal aims to tackle rising Medi-Cal costs by limiting eligibility for those with assets exceeding $2,000, including the value of a primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Health and disability advocates criticize the proposal, arguing it would sacrifice the health and human services of vulnerable populations and force them into poverty. The governor defends the proposal as a necessary measure to balance the state budget.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk lashed out when questioned about a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use during the 2024 campaign. Musk dismissed the report, questioning the credibility of the New York Times, during an Oval Office send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration. Musk's remarks came on the same day that the Times reported he used ketamine — which can be used both recreationally and medically — as often as once a day in 2024. The Oval Office back-and-forth came as Musk wrapped up his stint as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, where he oversaw the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

New money for defence will be partially found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income.</p>

Complaints related to these websites have spiked since March, with some claiming the rice was never delivered despite payment. The center advises consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid buying from websites that sell rice at unrealistically low prices. The average price of rice at supermarkets has risen steadily due to a poor harvest, hitting a record high in mid-May.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, despite convention traffic remaining steady. Hotel occupancy has slipped, and international visitors, who tend to spend more, are decreasing. Tourists are facing higher prices for coffee and other amenities, leading to concerns that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and city officials believe Las Vegas will remain resilient.</p>
