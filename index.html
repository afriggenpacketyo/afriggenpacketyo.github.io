          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and multiple injuries during a wedding event. Authorities quickly arrested a 23-year-old former employee, Hunter Nadeau, who was charged with second-degree murder. The incident, which lasted less than a minute, was contained in part by the courageous actions of patrons who intervened. Officials are investigating the motive but have indicated that it does not appear to be a hate-motivated crime.</p>

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has described the current Prime Minister's accommodating approach to U.S. President Donald Trump as "cringey" and embarrassing. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg argued that the government's "endless knee-bending" stems from a miscalculation that the UK will not have to choose between the US and the EU. He urged the Prime Minister to more actively "speak up" for British values and not become overly dependent on the United States.</p>

The event featured speeches from prominent figures including President Donald Trump, who called Kirk a "martyr for American freedom."

          <p>British Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana has announced her intention to "reconcile and move forward" with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn following a public dispute over the formation of their new left-wing political party. Sultana stated she would no longer pursue legal action over what she had previously called "baseless attacks" on her character. The disagreement emerged over the unauthorized launch of a membership system and accusations from Sultana that she was being excluded by a "sexist boys' club" within the party's leadership.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola adopted an uncharacteristically defensive 5-5-0 formation that nearly secured a victory against Arsenal, but a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, City ceded possession and focused on defense, a tactic that frustrated Arsenal for most of the match. The result leaves both teams trailing league leaders Liverpool, with analysts noting that City's fatigue from a packed schedule likely influenced Guardiola's conservative strategy.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg has responded to a revelation in Kamala Harris's new memoir that he was a leading contender to be her running mate in 2024, but was passed over due to the perceived risk of a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man. Harris wrote that while she wanted to select him, she felt America was not ready. Buttigieg stated he was surprised by the disclosure but believes in giving "Americans more credit," suggesting voters are more focused on results than identity politics.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, currently located northeast of the Philippines, has intensified to become the most powerful storm of 2025, with sustained winds reaching 270 km/h. This makes it a Category 5-equivalent storm, the highest possible rating on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The typhoon's extreme strength is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and a lack of wind shear. Ragasa is expected to maintain its peak intensity before gradually weakening as it moves towards the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Senior Democratic leaders are warning that President Donald Trump's recent actions, including publicly calling for the Justice Department to prosecute his political rivals, are moving the United States toward a dictatorship. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that turning the DOJ into an instrument against political enemies is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. The criticism intensified after the FCC, led by a Trump ally, threatened ABC's broadcast licenses following host Jimmy Kimmel's criticism of the administration, which Democrats cited as a dangerous attack on free speech.</p>

Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his role in the uprising, which included plans to assassinate his successor.</p>

While the investigation began during the previous administration, it was closed after being briefed to Trump's DOJ, raising concerns among some officials about the potential politicization of the department and the protection of high-profile allies from legal scrutiny.</p>

Cohn suggests that businesses have shifted from "hoarding labor" in the post-COVID era to actively managing expenses by letting their workforce decline through natural attrition.
