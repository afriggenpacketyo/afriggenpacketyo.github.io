          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 02:46:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are scaling back on hiring and not replacing employees who leave, leading to a decline in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate saw a slight increase. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there is a noticeable weakening in the labor market, with fewer people on company payrolls. This trend coincides with increased National Insurance Contributions paid by employers and the implementation of a minimum wage increase in April. The article highlights the current economic pressures affecting employment trends in the UK. Optimism around this situation is low.</p>

          <p>Temu and Shein are shifting their focus to Europe due to unfavorable trade policies in the U.S., but they are encountering regulatory challenges in their new target markets. Consumer spending on Temu in the U.S. fell by about 36% in May compared to the previous year, while Shein's spending decreased by 13% over the same period. The EU is preparing a new two-euro flat fee on previously customs-free small packages from online marketplaces, and complaints have been filed against Temu and Shein, accusing them of unsavory business tactics. Experts suggest that these regulatory headwinds could significantly impact the platforms' operations in Europe. The companies are facing increased scrutiny reminiscent of that in the U.S., potentially reshaping their growth strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters triggered by immigration enforcement operations, National Guard troops have arrived in downtown Los Angeles. Protests have spread throughout L.A. County, escalating to violence on several occasions, and multiple federal law enforcement officers were injured during confrontations with protesters. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized that the department cannot participate in civil immigration enforcement due to the California Values Act. Despite the unrest, the Trump administration has indicated that immigration enforcement will continue, with ICE enforcement and removal operations expected daily for the next 30 days in L.A. County. The situation remains tense as authorities work to manage the ongoing demonstrations.

          <p>The Australian government has expressed its concerns to the United States after an Australian reporter was seemingly targeted and shot with a rubber bullet while covering immigration-related protests in Los Angeles. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the incident was unacceptable and confirmed that he had spoken to the reporter, Lauren Tomasi, who was covering the protests for Australia's Nine News. Tomasi reported that she was sore but otherwise well and committed to continuing to report important stories. The incident has raised questions about the safety of journalists covering protests and the use of force by law enforcement. The overall sentiment is stable, but it is not overwhelmingly positive.</p>

          <p>Smugglers are exploiting loopholes in European regulations to traffic ketamine, often swapping it for substances like salt during transit. Ketamine is classified as a legal medicine in some countries, making it easier to transport across borders with less scrutiny. Criminal organizations are reportedly making more money from ketamine than other drugs like cocaine, leading to an "epidemic" of illegal sales. In the UK, ketamine consumption has risen significantly, with a corresponding increase in deaths linked to the drug, and law enforcement agencies are struggling to combat the complex smuggling networks. The situation calls for greater international cooperation to address the issue. The article conveys a sense of alarm.</p>

The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with expectations to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons prior to previous releases. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the government aims to quickly deliver the rice to consumers at lower prices.

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit arises as a biotechnology company seeks court approval to acquire the struggling firm. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without express, informed consent. They maintain that customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information. The lawsuit underscores the importance of data privacy in the context of corporate acquisitions.</p>

Senior civil servants responded that while healthy challenge was encouraged, resignation was an "honourable course" for those with deep disagreements.

The agency found that hundreds of millions of people are unable to have the number of children they desire due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries revealed that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children.

Data from the CDC shows a significant decrease in deaths attributed to fentanyl and other drugs among people under 35. This positive trend is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, researchers caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, particularly for those struggling with severe addiction. The article offers a hopeful outlook.</p>
