          <p>At a memorial service in Arizona attended by tens of thousands, former President Donald Trump eulogized conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot on September 10. Trump referred to the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA as a "great American hero" and a "martyr." The five-hour event, which resembled a political rally, also featured speeches from Vice President JD Vance and Kirk's widow, Erika, who announced she forgave the alleged killer. The service highlighted Kirk's influence on the conservative movement and his role in mobilizing young voters.</p>

          <p>A suspect is in federal custody after the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento was struck by gunfire in an apparent drive-by shooting. Police reported that at least three rounds hit the building, but no injuries occurred. Anibal Hernandez-Santana, 64, was initially arrested by local police on assault charges and released on bail before being taken into custody again by the FBI on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive remains under investigation, and the incident has been condemned by public officials as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people are curating personal playlists to provide comfort and connection during terminal illness and palliative care. Experts note that music has significant therapeutic benefits, capable of reducing anxiety and evoking powerful memories, even in unconscious patients, as hearing is believed to be the last sense to fade. For instance, a local DJ with a terminal illness has created a playlist of his life's most meaningful songs to share with his wife. This practice also offers lasting comfort to grieving loved ones, who can reconnect with memories through the shared music.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Use Electricity to Convert Food Waste into Valuable Industrial Chemicals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 20:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered that applying a mild electrical current to food waste can significantly boost the microbial process that breaks it down, yielding higher quantities of useful industrial chemicals like butanol and ethanol. This electrofermentation process could help reduce the 8-10% of global greenhouse gases generated by food waste while creating valuable products from discarded materials. The innovation offers a potential solution to reduce landfill methane, lessen reliance on fossil fuels for chemical production, and alleviate financial losses from uneaten food, which costs the average U.S. family around $1,500 annually.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Monday, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. According to a Reuters poll, the rates are expected to remain unchanged, a move that would follow the central bank's decision to hold a key interest rate steady after the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains, reflecting positive sentiment carrying over from record highs on the Dow and S&P 500.

          <p>German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance aircraft flying without a transponder or radio contact in neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea. The interception is the latest in a series of recent incursions by Russian military aircraft into or near NATO airspace, which have heightened regional tensions. In separate incidents this month, Russian aircraft allegedly violated Estonian airspace and Russian drones entered Polish and Romanian airspace, prompting consultations among NATO allies. Officials suggest these actions may be Russian provocations intended to divert Western attention from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance took a central role at Charlie Kirk's memorial, delivering a speech that heavily emphasized Christian faith and positioning himself as a successor to Kirk's influence over young conservatives. His actions, including personally escorting Kirk's casket and guest-hosting his podcast, are being interpreted as strategic moves for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. By aligning himself with Kirk's legacy, Vance appears to be consolidating support from the influential evangelical and youth wings of the Republican party. This positions him as a leading contender to carry the MAGA movement forward after Donald Trump's presidency.</p>

          <p>According to a child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, raising children with exceptional social skills depends more on early, consistent modeling than on memorizing polite phrases. Key practices include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Parents are also advised to teach conflict resolution, validate their child's feelings, and listen more than they lecture. These behaviors create an environment of emotional safety, which is the foundation for developing strong interpersonal abilities.</p>

The plan involves editing the DNA of wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, to make them permanently immune. This heritable immunity would be passed down through generations, breaking the transmission cycle where ticks become infected by biting the mice. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project aims to reduce the number of infected ticks without harming the mouse population or the broader ecosystem, though it requires careful community consultation and regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and autism, according to reports from The Washington Post. Federal health officials are anticipated to warn pregnant women against using the common painkiller unless they have a fever. This move follows President Trump's teaser of a major announcement on autism and previous reports that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was preparing a report on the topic. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, has strongly disputed any link, stating that over a decade of scientific research shows no credible evidence of causation.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout involving police officers in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence. Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to focus on commonalities rather than differences. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including a firebombing at the governor's mansion in April, and emphasized the distinction between protected political speech and illegal incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>A fan who caught Mike Trout's 400th career home run ball during a game in Colorado received a unique reward for returning the milestone souvenir. In addition to receiving signed memorabilia, the fan, identified as Alberto, made a special request to play catch with the Angels superstar on the field. Trout happily obliged, creating a memorable moment for the fan and his family. The home run made Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the 400-homer mark and the 20th to achieve it with a single franchise, making the returned ball a meaningful piece of his career history.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two spectacular defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball with his foot to regain control after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this with a leaping catch in the ninth inning to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss proved costly for the Mets, who fell into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wild-card spot.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Gabrielle's center will pass east of Bermuda on Monday, though no watches or warnings are currently in effect for the island. The storm is generating large swells that are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward and into Atlantic Canada. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA officials.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim measure. In an interview with the BBC, Lee argued that while the long-term goal remains denuclearization, halting the North's current production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually would be a feasible and beneficial alternative for now. President Lee, who aims to reduce tensions on the peninsula, believes resuming the talks that broke down in 2019 is possible due to the apparent mutual trust between Trump and Kim.</p>

          <p>Parents in south Wales are fighting to raise awareness about a "cluster" of cases of Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), a rare, inherited neurological disorder with no known cure. The condition, once thought to primarily affect people of Japanese descent, causes progressive memory loss, seizures, and loss of motor control. A 2007 study identified a high prevalence in Wales, and families are now connecting through social media to share information and advocate for better access to genetic testing. They find hope in early clinical trials for a potential treatment being conducted in the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a controversial £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a project the government is framing as a "no-brainer for growth." The privately-financed expansion involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport claims the project will create jobs and boost the economy, it faces strong opposition from local and environmental groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate impacts.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that the United Kingdom will formally recognize a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. The move, coordinated with Australia and Canada, is intended to preserve the viability of a two-state solution amid the ongoing conflict. Starmer emphasized that the decision is not a reward for Hamas and that the group can have no future role in governance. The announcement drew sharp condemnation from the Israeli government, which argued it rewards terrorism, while the Palestinian Authority welcomed it as a step toward peace.</p>
