          <p>A disciplinary panel has dismissed two Metropolitan Police officers for gross misconduct after they conducted a strip-search on a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q, in 2020. The search was deemed unjustified and humiliating, as the girl was wrongly suspected of possessing cannabis and was searched without an appropriate adult present while she was on her period. While the panel found the search was improper, it did not conclude that race was a factor, a finding that contrasts with a 2022 safeguarding report which suggested racism was likely involved.</p>

The primary advantages include significant debt reduction and providing an alternative to bankruptcy, often with a faster resolution timeline of two to four years. However, the strategy carries substantial risks, such as severe and long-lasting damage to one's credit score, no guarantee of success, and potential tax liabilities on the forgiven debt amount.

          <p>In a remarkable underdog story, 21-year-old British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, ranked 719th in the world, has qualified for the main singles draw at Wimbledon for the first time. Tarvet, who plays on the U.S. collegiate circuit, upset a much higher-ranked opponent in the final qualifying round. Due to his amateur status as a student-athlete, he will have to forfeit the majority of the Â£66,000 in prize money. His victory is part of a historic year for British tennis, which will see its largest number of home players in the singles draw in 41 years.</p>

          <p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), recently restructured by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted to recommend Merck's new injectable antibody, Enflonsia, for protecting infants from RSV. The decision, which also adds the shot to the government's list of recommended childhood immunizations, came as a relief to many in the public health community who were concerned about the new panel's direction. Despite two vaccine-critical members voting against it, the recommendation will allow the shot to be available for the upcoming RSV season.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, is pressing two energy companies, ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv, about their lobbying efforts to secure a $1.1 billion tax loophole in the Republican reconciliation bill. The proposed provision would exempt fossil fuel companies from the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax by allowing them to deduct intangible drilling costs. The senators argue this handout is particularly insulting as the same bill proposes cutting clean energy incentives and raising energy prices for families.</p>

The provision, which aimed to cut costs by cracking down on states' use of health care provider taxes, was found to violate the rules governing such budget packages. This ruling forces Republicans to either scrap or substantially re-engineer a major component of their bill, complicating their efforts to pass the legislation with only GOP votes before a July 4th deadline.</p>
