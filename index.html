          <p>Camp Mystic in Texas reported the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors due to severe flash flooding. The camp expressed grief and gratitude for the support received following the disaster, which claimed over 80 lives in the region. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha indicated that approximately 750 children were present at the camp when the flooding occurred. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the devastation as horrific, while authorities continue rescue and recovery operations with over 1,500 state personnel deployed to the flood zone. This incident has deeply affected the community and raised questions about flood preparedness in the area. Optimism is low given the tragic loss of life and the ongoing search efforts.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing in space technology, including satellite navigation, spy probes, anti-satellite weapons, and reusable space planes, raising concerns from the United States. While China maintains its space program is for peaceful purposes, technologies like the BeiDou navigation satellite system have potential military applications. BeiDou, with its network of 60 satellites, aims to challenge the U.S. military's GPS dominance, particularly in Belt and Road Initiative countries. It provides precise navigation and positioning services to the Chinese military, enhancing the accuracy of missiles and munitions, and offering secure communication capabilities. The ongoing space race between the U.S. and China continues to intensify.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced an 8% drop following CEO Elon Musk's announcement of forming a new political party called the "America Party." Investors have expressed concerns about Musk's increasing involvement in politics, fearing it could negatively impact Tesla's brand and performance. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities noted that many Tesla investors are exhausted by Musk's political endeavors. The announcement also drew criticism from President Donald Trump, adding to the turmoil. Tesla is already facing challenges, including a decline in car deliveries and rising competition in key markets, further contributing to investor unease (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Poland has initiated random checks at its border with Germany, impacting 52 crossings, which goes against the Schengen zone's principles. This action follows Germany's stricter border controls implemented under Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government since November 2023. Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak stated the checks aim to combat illegal immigration, assuring that EU nationals will not be hindered. The controls will focus on buses, minibuses, and cars carrying many passengers. Germany had previously announced it would turn back asylum-seekers at the Polish border, leading to claims that Berlin is overwhelming Poland with migrants.</p>

          <p>China's expansion of visa-free entry to nationals from numerous countries is yielding significant results, with a surge in overseas tourist arrivals boosting consumption in the first half of the year. South Korea, Japan, the United States, Thailand, and Russia are among the top sources of foreign visitors. Shanghai's Pudong International Airport leads in overseas traffic, with millions of entries. Beijing has seen a doubling of visa-free arrivals compared to last year, and Chengdu has experienced a substantial increase as well. This policy appears to be effectively stimulating China's tourism sector.</p>

          <h2>Netflix's Strategy for Attracting Top Directors</h2>

          <p>Netflix continues to attract big-name directors by offering lucrative contracts, creative freedom, and a large audience, even without promising wide theatrical releases. Directors like Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig have chosen Netflix for its deep financial resources and creative latitude. While some studies suggest theatrical releases enhance a film's value, Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos maintains the company's focus is providing content directly to its streaming subscribers. Netflix saves on marketing costs by skipping theaters, and its success is measured by viewership rather than box-office dollars. This strategy allows Netflix to produce films that might not otherwise get made, and maintain a competitive edge in the streaming market.</p>

          <p>Parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy will be entitled to bereavement leave under a planned amendment to the Employment Rights Bill. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the change aims to provide time for grieving without the pressure of returning to work prematurely. Currently, bereavement leave is only available after 24 weeks of pregnancy. The proposed extended leave would be unpaid and last for at least one week, with further details to be determined following a consultation. This measure would apply in England, Scotland, and Wales, recognizing the emotional toll of early pregnancy loss.</p>

The current deficit exceeds 6% of GDP, raising concerns about long-term fiscal health. The markets, economy, and international relations are at risk due to persistent deficits. Experts like Ray Dalio warn of late-stage debt cycle signs, while others foresee economic strain through inflation and reduced investment. Niall Ferguson notes that the U.S. now spends more on interest payments than defense, a historic indicator of decline.
