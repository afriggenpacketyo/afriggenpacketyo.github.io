          <p>GameStop has made its first foray into the cryptocurrency market by purchasing 4,710 bitcoins, valued at $512.6 million, following a trend popularized by MicroStrategy. The video game retailer's shares dipped slightly after the announcement, even though the company had a substantial cash reserve of $4.76 billion as of February 1. CEO Ryan Cohen aims to revitalize the business by cutting costs and streamlining operations, while this move into cryptocurrencies is part of his broader strategy. GameStop's decision reflects a growing interest in alternative stores of value like bitcoin, particularly amid easing trade tensions and concerns about U.S. sovereign debt.

          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has prioritized support for Ukraine, promising assistance with the procurement and joint production of long-range missiles. The aim is to enable Ukraine to defend itself fully, even against military targets outside its own territory, without range restrictions. Germany will also continue funding the Starlink satellite communications system for Ukraine. Merz has long advocated for the delivery of long-range Taurus missiles, differentiating himself from his predecessor, but now practices strategic ambiguity.

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth Super Heavy-Starship rocket test flight, encountering new challenges that led to the loss of both stages. The Super Heavy first stage suffered a catastrophic failure during its descent, while the Starship upper stage reached its suborbital trajectory but experienced a door failure preventing satellite deployment. An apparent propellant leak caused the Starship to spin, ruling out a controlled reentry and splashdown. Despite the setbacks, Elon Musk noted improvements, including no significant heat shield tile loss during ascent, with plans for faster launch cadence after reviewing telemetry data.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the Republican spending bill, arguing that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in reducing wasteful government spending. Musk, head of DOGE, stated that the bill would increase the budget deficit, contradicting DOGE's efforts to save taxpayer money through government layoffs and streamlining operations. While Trump and Republicans claim the bill reduces spending in key areas and will stimulate economic growth, the Congressional Budget Office projects it will raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Musk has scaled back his involvement with DOGE to focus on his companies.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest pursuing credit card debt forgiveness this June due to high interest rates, the lengthy process involved, and the less damaging impact on credit compared to other options. With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21% and balances rising, exploring debt forgiveness, where creditors agree to settle for a lower amount, may be beneficial. The process can take 24 to 48 months, and delaying it can lead to compounding interest and deeper debt. Credit card forgiveness is considered a better alternative to defaulting or filing for bankruptcy, as it shows an effort to repay the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC has selected "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki as the top business book to read in June. The book explores the question of whether it is foolish to believe that people remain fundamentally decent, arguing that optimism is supported by science and leads to better outcomes. Zaki challenges the notion that intelligence and success require cynicism, citing research indicating that cynics are often sicker, poorer, and more wrong. The book suggests that a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned and aligned with success.</p>

Judge Brian Murphy found the White House violated a court order by deporting people from other countries to South Sudan and ruled that they must have a chance to raise fears about being sent there. The government argues that Murphy's requirements are a major setback to deporting people who cannot be returned to their home countries, while Murphy says he has given the administration "remarkable flexibility."</p>
