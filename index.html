            <h2>Homan Defends Trump Administration's Deportation of Abrego Garcia</h2>

            <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleged to be an MS-13 gang member, despite concerns over due process. Homan cited the Alien Enemies Act, arguing it allows for limited due process rights when removing national security threats. Senator Chris Van Hollen countered, emphasizing the importance of upholding constitutional rights for all, regardless of gang affiliation, and accused the administration of lying about the case to distract from questions about whether his rights were violated when he was deported to El Salvador last month. The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act hours after Homan's defense of the law. Optimism Score: 30</p>

            <p>A boat fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in 33 deaths, a figure significantly lower than initial reports of up to 148 fatalities. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers, involving a boat carrying approximately 400 people. Congolese police believe cooking onboard the vessel ignited the blaze. Inadequate road infrastructure often leads Congolese people to travel by boat, but overcrowding and lack of safety measures contribute to frequent accidents. Optimism Score: 15</p>
