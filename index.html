          <h2>Texas Governor Signs School Choice Bill Into Law Amid Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities up to $30,000, and home-schooled students $2,000 annually. Democrats argue the legislation will siphon funds from the already underfunded public school system, primarily benefiting wealthier families who already send their children to private schools. Abbott and supporters say the bill empowers parents to choose the educational option that best suits their children's needs, while opponents describe it as welfare for the wealthy at the expense of public-school children.</p>

The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for prioritizing his oath of office and the Constitution over political pressure, highlighting his commitment to democratic principles. Pence's actions on January 6, including presiding over the certification of electoral votes, solidified his legacy as a figure who defended the integrity of the electoral process.</p>

          <p>After a lackluster fight between Canelo √Ålvarez and William Scull, √Ålvarez announced he will face Terence Crawford in September. Crawford, a champion in multiple weight classes, will move up to 168 pounds to challenge √Ålvarez, raising questions about the size and strength disparity. Some boxing analysts believe Crawford is primarily motivated by the financial opportunity, while others are concerned about his ability to absorb Canelo's power at a higher weight. While the fight is anticipated to be more exciting than the Scull match, there are concerns it could be another uneven contest given Crawford's size disadvantage.</p>

Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser disputes claims that property acquisition is the primary cause of delays, citing other factors such as bureaucratic entanglements and design changes.

          <p>Bayern Munich has secured its 33rd Bundesliga title, reclaiming the trophy after Bayer Leverkusen's historic unbeaten season in 2023-24. Vincent Kompany, despite being an unexpected choice for coach, has steadied the ship with a strong start and effective management. Key to Bayern's success has been the addition of Premier League talents Harry Kane and Michael Olise, bolstering their attack. While Leverkusen faltered, Bayern's strength in depth and Kompany's tactical rotations have proven decisive in returning the club to the top of German football.</p>

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like...?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships, arguing it's more toxic than many realize. This comparison can lead to irreparable insecurity issues, making partners feel inadequate and constantly question their worth. The phrase is often a symptom of a deeper issue: a fear of openly expressing needs, which can lead to suppressed frustrations and resentment. The psychologist suggests that open and direct communication, without shame or comparison, is essential for a healthy relationship.</p>
