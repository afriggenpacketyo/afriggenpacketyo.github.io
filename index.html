        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Copenhagen Airport resumed operations after a nearly four-hour suspension triggered by sightings of two to three large, unidentified drones in its vicinity. Danish police confirmed they could not ascertain the drones' origin or specific type, despite Ukrainian President Zelensky later referencing "Russia's violation" of NATO airspace in Copenhagen, without providing a source. The disruption caused significant flight delays and diverted at least 35 flights, prompting an ongoing police investigation and warnings for passengers to verify their flight statuses. This incident highlights persistent global concerns regarding the security of critical national infrastructure against unidentified aerial threats, emphasizing the challenges in identifying and neutralizing such incursions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced that US doctors would soon advise pregnant women to avoid Tylenol due to a disputed link with autism. Trump claimed paracetamol "is no good" unless for extreme fever, while Tylenol maker Kenvue defended its safety, citing inconsistent and inconclusive research. The FDA is expected to issue a physician's notice and consider label changes, also approving Leucovorin for autism treatment, based on early research. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, strongly pushed back, emphasizing Tylenol as the safest pain reliever for pregnant women and criticizing the announcement as not backed by full scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk, which critics characterized as a divisive "battle cry" for the Trump administration's "state-sponsored war" against its perceived enemies. Miller's rhetoric depicted opponents as "worthless, irredeemably wicked," asserting his side's destiny to destroy them, a stark contrast to past calls for unity from figures like Barack Obama. The article highlights Miller's "Manichean style," which equates political adversaries with "malevolence," and suggests the speech used Kirk's murder as a convenient pretext to further an agenda of political subjugation. This approach is seen as a deliberate antithesis to calls for national reconciliation and unity.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne lauded the "remarkable" journalists who exposed widespread phone hacking in the media, ahead of ITV's new drama, "The Hack." Starring David Tennant as Guardian reporter Nick Davies, the series delves into the scandal at the News of the World, revealing troubling connections between the press, politics, and police. Thorne, also known for "Adolescence," emphasized that unlike the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, where journalism struggled to gain public traction, this drama celebrates journalists who successfully held their own industry accountable. The show also features Robert Carlyle as a detective investigating the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, offering dual perspectives on the complex events.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, which were stripped-down versions of more advanced AI chips, despite US intentions to maintain technological leadership while allowing "safe" alternatives. Regulators have ordered leading technology companies to halt purchases and initiated antitrust investigations into Nvidia, signaling a pivotal turning point in global technology politics. Beijing views accepting these compromised chips as acknowledging US-dictated inferiority, now prioritizing complete technological independence. This strategic shift from tolerating reliance on US supply chains to making self-reliance an unavoidable national necessity was directly catalyzed by Washington's earlier imposition of sweeping restrictions on high-end artificial intelligence chips, fundamentally reshaping internal debates on dependence.</p>

Macron emphasized the need for a two-state solution, calling for a ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages, and a transitional administration involving the Palestinian Authority. Israel, however, condemned the recognition as rewarding Hamas and rejected the notion of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, providing significant relief to the University of California system. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants were suspended via unspecific form letters, likely violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The frozen funds, impacting critical cancer and stroke research, had threatened layoffs and lab closures. This ruling expands an existing class-action lawsuit, with the judge criticizing the administration's "un-reasoned mass terminations" and demanding compliance.

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual pannage season, an ancient tradition dating back to 1079. This practice is crucial for the forest's ecology, as the pigs graze on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the free-roaming ponies and cattle. Initiated due to a "heavy acorn crop," the season helps maintain the health of other livestock. Officials remind visitors to keep a safe distance and drive carefully, as pigs have been struck by cars in previous years.

          <h2>Trump's Unproven Tylenol-Autism Claims Part of Broader "Anti-Science" Agenda for Women's Health</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump's unproven claims linking Tylenol to autism are part of a broader "anti-science" agenda within his administration that undermines established medical interventions for pregnant women. This article highlights previous efforts to cast doubt on Covid vaccines and antidepressants during pregnancy, despite medical consensus on their benefits. The administration's promotion of "restorative reproductive medicine" over IVF also aligns with an "appeal to nature" fallacy, which critics argue endangers women's health and safety. Experts warn that discouraging Tylenol, a safe fever reducer, risks significant maternal and infant health complications, while promoting a shaming narrative around women's choices in pregnancy.</p>

          <h2>UK Liberal Democrats Propose Discount Visas for US Cancer Scientists Amid Trump's Funding Cuts</h2>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK Liberal Democrats, is urging the government to offer discount visas to US cancer scientists whose research has been affected by Trump administration funding cuts. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey proposed a fellowship scheme to attract scientists fleeing the US government's "anti-science agenda." This initiative aims to position the UK as a global leader in cancer research, contrasting with Trump's decision to cut billions from biomedical research grants. The move also serves as a political attack on Trump and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, whom Davey accuses of wanting to turn the UK into "Trump's America."</p>

          <p>The UK's freedom of speech debate has reached a "boiling point," with figures like Nigel Farage comparing the country to North Korea over speech restrictions. US Vice-President JD Vance and Forbes magazine also criticized the UK's "speech censorship." This article details cases like Lucy Connolly's imprisonment for inciting racial hatred on X and Elon Musk's controversial rally speech, which, though inflammatory, was deemed legal. It explores how social media has amplified these issues and the lack of consensus on policing online speech. Public opinion leans towards safety over free expression, especially among younger generations, highlighting a generational and political divide on the issue.</p>

          <p>A 4.3 magnitude earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday, waking many residents but causing no reported injuries or major damage, though some businesses saw broken windows. The quake, centered east-south-east of Berkeley, was felt by over 22,000 people. Public transit experienced delays for safety inspections. Officials noted this was a typical "felt but not impactful" quake, yet it served as a stark reminder of the region's seismic risks and the ongoing need for earthquake preparedness. The last similar-sized quake in the area was a 4.4 magnitude event in 2018.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as patron or ambassador by seven charities after a 2011 email surfaced, in which she called convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein her "supreme friend" and seemingly apologized for public criticism. This contradicted her earlier public denunciation of Epstein. Charities like Julia's House and the Teenage Cancer Trust deemed her continued involvement "inappropriate." A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under advice to "assuage Epstein and his threats." This scandal, following Prince Andrew's own associations with Epstein, has severely damaged her public profile and raised questions about her future royal standing.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta accused FCC Chairman Brendan Carr of an unlawful "campaign of censorship," demanding he cease intimidating broadcasters after ABC suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Bonta cited Carr's threats following Kimmel's comments on Charlie Kirk's death, arguing it violated First Amendment rights and created a "chilling effect." While Kimmel's show was reinstated, Bonta rejected Trump and Carr's denials of involvement, asserting they were "waging a dangerous attack on those who dare to speak out." He called for Carr to disavow his threats and pledge to protect free speech, highlighting the administration's broader assault on expression.</p>

          <p>This commentary urges Jimmy Kimmel to return to his show "undaunted" and continue satirizing the Trump administration, framing it as a "patriotic duty" against self-censorship and authoritarianism. The article argues that if influential figures like Kimmel succumb to pressure, it sets a dangerous precedent for average citizens. It connects the administration's actions, such as threats against journalists and Stephen Miller's divisive rhetoric, to historical patterns of autocrats targeting comedians to manage dissent. The piece posits that humor builds camaraderie, drains fear, and is an effective tool against those who seek to dominate civic life with a "narrow and angry Christianity."</p>

          <p>A federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's former "border czar," was closed by the Trump administration. Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents while a private citizen, in exchange for promising government contracts. The White House denied the allegations, calling the investigation "entrapment" and "weaponization of the Biden DOJ." This article highlights the incident as another example of the politicization of Trump's Justice Department, amidst other controversies like a US Attorney's resignation and Trump's calls for criminal charges against political opponents. The story raises concerns about integrity in government.</p>
