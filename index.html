          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back from El Salvador. Federal prosecutors allege he conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including children, from Mexico and Central America for thousands of dollars. The case has been marked by legal battles, including his deportation to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring it. Prosecutors argue Abrego Garcia is a flight risk due to alleged MS-13 ties, while his attorneys claim the government's arguments for detention are meritless and that there is no evidence he will obstruct justice.</p>

Jones was found guilty of burglary for conducting reconnaissance. The judge described the heist as "bold and brazen," and police recovered DNA and incriminating messages from Sheen's phone, which led to the conviction.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has lost his bid for a full appeals court rehearing regarding the E. Jean Carroll case, where he was found liable for sexual assault and defamation. The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected Trump's request to rehear his challenge to the verdict, with two judges dissenting. Trump's legal team suggests they will appeal to the Supreme Court, while Carroll's attorney stated that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. A panel of judges is scheduled to hear oral arguments on June 24 regarding Trump's appeal of a separate $83.3 million verdict in another defamation suit filed by Carroll.</p>

          <p>The second trial of Karen Read, accused of killing her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in 2022, is nearing its end. Prosecutors allege Read hit O'Keefe with her car and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argues O'Keefe was attacked and left outside. The lead investigator from the first trial, Michael Proctor, was not called to testify in the retrial. The judge denied two motions for a mistrial, and Read did not take the stand in her own defense.</p>
