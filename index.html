          <p>Leeds United secured a 1-0 victory over Everton in their Premier League return, thanks to a contentious penalty decision. The spot-kick was awarded after the ball struck Everton defender James Tarkowski's arm, which was positioned close to his body. The decision has sparked widespread debate among players, managers, and pundits, highlighting ongoing confusion and disagreement over the interpretation of the handball rule. While some believed the referee made the correct call, others labeled it a "scandal," reflecting the murky nature of the current regulations.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist from the University of Hong Kong who identified the Sars coronavirus in 2003, has warned that the next global pandemic is inevitable. He expressed concern that the world may not be significantly better prepared than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. Peiris highlighted the increasing frequency of animal viruses jumping to humans and emphasized that respiratory viruses pose a particular threat. He argues for a more integrated approach to global health, combining human, animal, and environmental wellness to build resilience against future outbreaks.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent in southern California fired at a moving vehicle during an immigration stop after the driver refused to comply and sped away. The Department of Homeland Security stated the driver struck two agents, prompting one to fire in self-defense, though no one was hit by the bullets. However, video captured by the driver's family members in the car does not show the agents being struck. The incident has heightened tensions in the region, where immigrant advocates and local officials criticize federal enforcement tactics as overly aggressive and fear-inducing.</p>

          <p>After leaving Texas for several weeks to block a Republican-led effort to redraw voting maps, Democratic lawmakers have returned to the state capital. The Democrats' departure broke the legislature's quorum, preventing a vote on the new electoral maps which they argue are discriminatory and unconstitutional. While their return allows the Republican majority to proceed with another legislative session, Democrats claim their protest successfully raised national awareness about gerrymandering. This standoff is part of a larger national battle, as Democrat-led states are now considering their own redistricting efforts to counter potential Republican gains.</p>

Prosecutors stated Sangha supplied the fatal dose through intermediaries, including Perry's personal assistant who administered the drug. Her plea agreement also includes admissions to selling ketamine in connection with another overdose death in 2019.</p>

          <p>During a high-stakes meeting at the White House, top European leaders urged President Donald Trump to press for a ceasefire in Ukraine before advancing peace talks with Russia. The summit, which included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, followed Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin, which had raised concerns about the U.S. commitment to European security. While Trump expressed a desire to stop the killing, he backed away from making a ceasefire a precondition for talks, suggesting a deal could be made "through the war." European officials also sought clarity on "Article 5-like" security guarantees for Ukraine in any future settlement.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice for attaching new immigration enforcement conditions to federal grants for crime victims. The new rule denies funding to programs that do not cooperate with federal immigration agents, a move the states argue is an unlawful attempt to coerce them into abandoning "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit contends that these conditions force states to choose between forfeiting critical resources for vulnerable victims and co-opting local officials for federal immigration enforcement. The states are seeking an injunction to block the rule.</p>

Established in 1894, the holiday honors the contributions and hard-won rights of the American workforce, which now numbers around 170 million people. While many will celebrate with gatherings and travel, it's also a time to reflect on labor conditions. Most retail stores and restaurants will remain open, though some, like Costco, will be closed.

The piece suggests that China's significant investment signals its view of London as a critical global capital and partner. While acknowledging political opposition and security concerns, the author posits that the embassy could be seen as a powerful statement of diplomatic commitment, contrasting with the UK's recent sales of diplomatic properties.</p>

This persistent gap means that for many households, purchasing power has effectively decreased, contributing to widespread economic dissatisfaction. The study found that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind than others. In contrast, sectors that saw a post-pandemic surge in demand, such as leisure, hospitality, and healthcare, have seen wage growth that outpaced inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

However, eligibility can be complex, as BNPL is a newer financial product and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements.

The Constitution grants states the power to determine the "time, place and manner" of elections, with Congress having the authority to alter rules for federal contests. This analysis highlights the separation of powers and notes that any sweeping federal changes to election laws would have to originate from Congress, not the executive branch.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin's price falling approximately 1.1% after recently hitting a new all-time high of over $124,000. The decline was attributed to broader macroeconomic concerns, particularly higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data, which has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This uncertainty triggered a significant wave of liquidations, with traders being forced to sell over $500 million in leveraged positions across the crypto market. Ether and other major cryptocurrencies also saw their prices slide in response to the market pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, experienced a brief but widespread network outage on Monday, with thousands of users reporting service interruptions. This was the second such outage for the service in two weeks, the previous one being attributed to an internal software failure. The disruption occurred on the same day SpaceX successfully launched another batch of satellites for its growing constellation from Vandenberg Space Force Base. The company, which aims to increase its launch frequency, is currently facing opposition from the California Coastal Commission over potential environmental impacts.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece characterizes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's White House meeting with President Donald Trump as a carefully navigated diplomatic performance. Having learned from a contentious previous visit, Zelenskyy employed a more cautious and flattering approach, successfully avoiding any public confrontations. The meeting was also attended by several European leaders, whose presence was seen as an effort to keep the discussions focused and prevent a repeat of past meltdowns. While Trump made numerous exaggerated claims about his peacemaking abilities, the summit ultimately concluded without any major diplomatic incidents, a positive outcome for the Ukrainian delegation.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio recordings have revealed that Israel's former chief of military intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, stated that a high number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza was "necessary and required." In the recordings, Haliva is heard saying that for every Israeli killed on October 7, 2023, 50 Palestinians should die, regardless of whether they are children. Haliva, who resigned over the intelligence failures that led to the Hamas attack, confirmed the authenticity of the remarks but said they were taken out of context. The comments have drawn condemnation from human rights groups as evidence of a deliberate policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed the revocation of more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law and visa overstays. The department cited reasons such as assault, burglary, and driving under the influence for the majority of the revocations. Additionally, 200 to 300 visas were revoked for activities defined as "support for terrorism," a move that comes amid the Trump administration's increased scrutiny of international students, including those involved in pro-Palestinian protests. The policy is part of a broader crackdown that includes enhanced social media vetting for all visa applicants.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet" offers a fresh, female-empowered take on Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to rewrite the ending so that Juliet does not die, instead embarking on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. This review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read and energetic direction, which create a jubilant atmosphere that successfully integrates pop anthems from artists like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The result is a feel-good, euphoric musical that celebrates second chances and personal emancipation.</p>
