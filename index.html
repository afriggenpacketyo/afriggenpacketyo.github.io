          <p>Japan's government announced that China has agreed to start procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which had been banned after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and open registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue seeking the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. While Japanese fishermen welcomed the announcement, it may take a few months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks. The agreement covers businesses allowed to export to China before the wastewater discharge, and China found no abnormal radioactive substance concentrations near the Fukushima plant. The new agreement could be a significant step towards resolving other bilateral issues between the two countries.</p>

The competition came down to Faizan, Sarv Dharavane, and Sarvadnya Kadam, with Faizan ultimately securing the victory after his competitors misspelled their words. He became the fifth runner-up to come back and win the competition, marking the first time this has happened since 2001. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual competition where students from across the U.S. compete by spelling increasingly difficult words.</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York Cityâ€™s Police Commissioner during the 9/11 terror attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik joined the NYPD in 1986 and served as the department's 40th commissioner from 2000 to 2001 under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. His career included a stint in President George W. Bush's administration, leading a provisional police force in Iraq in 2003. However, his rise was marred by legal troubles, including a guilty plea to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2009, leading to a prison sentence, though he was later pardoned by President Trump. His legacy includes his service during 9/11 and his work in rebuilding the city after the attacks.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new arena in the rivalry between China and the United States. While he believes full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, he warns that the U.S. could gradually expand sanctions targeting specific Chinese entities, potentially pushing China out of the U.S. dollar system. Lian notes that sanctioning China within the SWIFT system would significantly damage the system itself, given China's position as a major trading nation. He suggests that excluding China from SWIFT could lead countries to shift to China's alternative payment system, CIPS, undermining SWIFT's dominance (not investment advice).</p>
