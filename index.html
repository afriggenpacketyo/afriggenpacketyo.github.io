          <p>Pop singer Sabrina Carpenter has released an alternate cover for her upcoming album, "Man's Best Friend," following public backlash against the original artwork, which some critics called dehumanizing. The new version was humorously presented as being "approved by God." In recent interviews, Carpenter has addressed the intense scrutiny female artists face, particularly regarding her own sexually suggestive lyrics and stage performances. She defends her artistic choices, stating that femininity is something she embraces and that she feels pressure to be funny.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing a desire to leave the "political theatre and partisan gridlock" of Washington. His decision came just hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him for opposing a major spending and tax bill. Tillis expressed frustration that independent thinking and bipartisanship have become "an endangered species" in politics. The retirement opens up a key Senate seat in a state that has reliably voted Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

The institution serves as a center for astronomical research, aiming to show that the Church supports scientific inquiry. Scientists and students at the observatory view their work studying the heavens as a way to unite people across different faiths. The observatory stands as a symbol of the long and sometimes complex relationship between religious institutions and scientific discovery.</p>

          <p>Scientists and cancer patients are voicing alarm over budget cuts and layoffs impacting medical research, which they say are being pushed by the Trump administration. According to a CBS News report, these actions jeopardize crucial progress in finding cures for cancer, an issue that has historically received strong bipartisan support. The cuts threaten not only the work of researchers at institutions like the National Cancer Institute but also the viability of clinical trials for patients. This shift in policy is seen as a significant setback for the national effort to combat the disease.</p>

His success suggests that for many progressive and younger Jewish voters, criticism of the Israeli government's actions in Gaza has become a greater priority.

          <p>Animal welfare experts are urging dog owners to take extreme precautions during heatwaves, as exercising dogs in hot weather is a leading cause of heat-related illness. Dogs have a limited ability to cool themselves and can overheat quickly, leading to heavy panting, lethargy, and in severe cases, collapse. Owners are advised to avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water. On extremely hot days, keeping dogs indoors with air conditioning and engaging in indoor play is the safest option to prevent a medical emergency.</p>

Grossi noted that while the facilities sustained severe damage, it was not total, and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild. His comments contrast with the Trump administration's claims that the program was "totally obliterated," suggesting the setback for Iran's nuclear ambitions may only be temporary.</p>
