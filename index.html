          <h2>Weight-Loss Injections Lead to Loose Skin Challenges for Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 01:01:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many individuals using weight-loss injections like Mounjaro and Wegovy achieve significant weight loss, but are left with excess loose skin, impacting their self-confidence. Emilly Murray, 35, describes feeling like a "90-year-old woman" due to skin hanging over her knees, despite improved health. Experts state that rapid weight loss often results in stretched skin, with surgery being the only effective solution for significant cases. However, such body contouring procedures are rarely available on the NHS and can cost tens of thousands privately, presenting a new financial burden for those seeking a post-weight-loss body image.</p>

          <p>As schools resume, parent WhatsApp groups are reigniting discussions about their utility and drawbacks. While some parents find them helpful for coordinating school events and sharing information, others, like Claire Berry, choose to leave due to competitive parenting, divisive policy debates, and overwhelming notifications. These groups can create unnecessary anxiety, polarize opinions, and disproportionately burden mothers with school administration. Experts suggest setting clear boundaries for engagement, recognizing that while useful for some, they can also become sources of stress and conflict for both parents and school staff.</p>

The 32-year-old recorded a long jump of 6.42m and expressed disappointment over a marginally fouled bigger leap. Fellow British athletes Keely Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell also progressed to the women's 800m final, aiming for a historic one-two finish. Johnson-Thompson remains optimistic about her performance despite the tight margins, reflecting on her journey back from injury and her recent Olympic silver medal.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating a shooting incident where gunfire struck the ABC10 news station building in Sacramento, California, on Friday afternoon. Police responded to reports of a shooting at approximately 1:30 p.m., finding at least three bullet holes in one of the station's windows. Although employees were inside the building at the time, no injuries were reported. The shots were reportedly fired from a vehicle that quickly fled the scene, with police yet to release a motive or suspect information.

          <p>Estonia has requested urgent consultations with NATO members after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes on Friday. Estonia's foreign ministry condemned the incursion as "brazen" and a "clear provocation," calling for a unified NATO response. NATO immediately intercepted the aircraft, and Russia denied any violation, claiming its jets flew over neutral Baltic waters. This incident follows similar airspace breaches in Poland and Romania, escalating tensions and prompting NATO to strengthen its eastern flank with additional military assets.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, a significant political contest often seen as a bellwether for the current presidential administration's policies. Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger are the contenders, with Spanberger currently favored in some polls. National issues, particularly the Trump administration's federal workforce cuts, are central to the campaign, given Virginia's large federal employee population. Spanberger critiques the financial impact of Washington's policies, while Earle-Sears emphasizes job creation and ties herself to the popular term-limited Governor Youngkin.</p>

US President Donald Trump's decision not to attend the Quad summit in New Delhi due to "losing interest" in the framework is viewed as potentially dangerous from a Japanese perspective.

          <p>Following President Trump's suggestions that critical TV networks should lose their licenses and the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, questions arise about the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) power. The FCC, established in 1934, primarily regulates local TV and radio stations, not national networks directly, and sets rules for obscenity and decency. While it can influence mergers by denying license transfers, the FCC is legally barred from preventing specific viewpoints. Experts note that despite broad rules allowing significant leeway, enforcement of licensing regulations has decreased since the 1980s, though the theoretical power to rescind licenses remains.</p>

          <p>The arrest of 73-year-old Harjit Kaur by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has sparked shock and sympathy within the Sikh community and beyond. Kaur, who lived in California for over three decades after unsuccessfully applying for asylum, was detained during a routine check-in, despite having no criminal record and faithfully reporting to authorities. Her family reports distressing conditions in detention, while critics argue her case exemplifies the Trump administration's broad crackdown targeting even non-criminal immigrants. Congressman John Garamendi and State Senator Jesse Arreguin are advocating for her release, highlighting the human impact of current immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Jordan Wilmore, a 7-foot-3 former professional basketball player, has chosen to leave his athletic career to pursue his lifelong passion for policing. Despite societal pressure to capitalize on his height in basketball, Wilmore, 24, realized his true calling was to help others. He is now training at a police academy in Kemah, Texas, where Chief Raymond Garivey is making accommodations for his unique stature, including finding a suitable uniform and patrol car. Wilmore's dedication to service is evident, as he states he would turn down an NBA offer to remain in Kemah, committed to the "thin blue line."</p>

          <p>A columnist satirically reflects on President Trump's influence, the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, and broader American issues, urging readers to find optimism amidst cynicism. The article critiques Trump's complaints about media bias and his administration's actions regarding healthcare and climate science, while also mocking the idea of unquestioning loyalty. It highlights the irony of Trump's "TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!" hats and suggests Kimmel should wear a "KIMMEL WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!" hat if he returns. The piece uses humor to comment on political discourse, free speech concerns, and the challenges of finding truth in a polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned after facing pressure from the Trump administration to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Siebert reportedly refused to prosecute James for alleged mortgage fraud due to insufficient evidence, leading to President Trump's public declaration that he wanted Siebert "out." James's lawyer condemned the move as a "brazen attack on the rule of law," while Trump cited Siebert's support from Democratic senators as a reason for his dismissal. Siebert intends to continue as a line prosecutor, but his departure leaves a critical office without leadership.</p>

          <p>CDC vaccine advisers unanimously recommended shifting to "shared clinical decision-making" for Covid-19 vaccines, meaning individuals must consult a healthcare provider. This applies to those 65 and older, and people aged 6 months to 64 years at increased risk for severe Covid-19. A tied vote meant no prescription would be required. Experts warn this change could create confusion and decrease vaccine uptake, as it assumes universal healthcare access and shifts the onus to patients and doctors. The recommendations, pending CDC Director approval, could lead to varied vaccine access across states and potentially impact public health efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has again asked the US Supreme Court to intervene in its efforts to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. The Justice Department filed an emergency application to lift a federal judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked authority to end the protections. The administration argues that maintaining TPS is "contrary to the national interest" and seeks to expand the pool of potential deportees as part of its broader immigration crackdown. This move highlights ongoing legal battles and the administration's aggressive stance on immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a crucial testing ground for Chinese exporters pivoting their focus to Southeast Asia. Facing slowing demand in Western markets, many companies view the region's fast-growing economies and young consumer base as a significant opportunity for expansion. Li Wenqi, an electric scooter manufacturer, exemplifies this shift, noting the saturation of Western markets and geopolitical instability elsewhere. The annual event allows Chinese firms to court new buyers and establish a stronger presence in Southeast Asia, signaling a strategic reorientation in their global market ambitions.

          <p>A US federal judge dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and filled with "tedious and burdensome" language unrelated to legal merits. The judge granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint, emphasizing that a lawsuit is not a "megaphone for public relations." The Times welcomed the ruling, asserting the original complaint was a political document designed to stifle independent reporting.</p>
