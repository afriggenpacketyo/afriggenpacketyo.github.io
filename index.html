          <p>The United States has criticized Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire agreement, stating that the suggested changes are a step backward. Officials highlight that Hamas is seeking revisions to the guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which has been a major point of contention with Israel. The US maintains that Hamas should accept the original framework to begin immediate talks for a 60-day cease-fire deal. This development underscores the ongoing challenges in reaching a resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, as both sides remain at odds over key terms and conditions.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based scientist has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to time delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could potentially be exploited by eavesdroppers to compromise the satellite's quantum key distribution system. The researcher, Alexander Miller, analyzed data from Micius and found that the distribution of quantum keys was insecure. This revelation raises concerns about the security of China's quantum communication network, which relies on the satellite for secure information transfer.</p>
