          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders have launched an action plan aimed at mitigating risks associated with critical mineral supply chains, which are often excessively dependent on China. This plan involves increased cooperation among G7 nations and with other aligned countries to safeguard economic security against market manipulation. The strategy includes monitoring for shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and promoting diversification and domestic production of essential minerals, with a roadmap for standards-based markets expected by year-end. The G7 also emphasized the importance of stable relations with China, while urging the country to avoid market distortions and overcapacity.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai have signed an action plan to facilitate mainland Chinese companies' global expansion through Hong Kong's capital market. The agreement aims to enhance the connect program linking the two cities' stock markets, expanding access to equities, bonds, ETFs, and gold, while also promoting cross-border settlements and the use of the digital yuan. This collaboration underscores the strategic importance of Hong Kong as an offshore financial hub for Chinese firms seeking to 'go global'. The agreement was the first signed at the annual Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, signaling Beijing's commitment to market liberalization and policy direction.</p>

          <p>President Trump's potential involvement in military action against Iran has exposed deep divisions among his supporters, pitting isolationist and hawkish factions against each other. While Trump campaigned on ending "stupid endless wars," he also maintained that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons, leading to conflicting views on intervention. Conservative Republican Thomas Massie joined Democrats to introduce a bill requiring congressional approval for military action against Iran. Supporters of Trump's "America First" doctrine argue against foreign entanglements, while others advocate for a more aggressive stance against the Iranian regime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on passport applications. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals applying for new passports, renewals, or changes to name or sex designation can choose their identified gender. The ruling expands on a previous decision and counters President Trump's policy that reversed a Biden administration directive allowing self-selection of gender and an "X" designation. The ACLU, representing transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued the policy was discriminatory, leading to the judge's finding that the administration failed to justify the policy's rationale.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, including the underground uranium enrichment site at Fordo. The decision is under discussion among Trump's national security advisors, though there is not full agreement on how to proceed. Israel has alleged that Iran is rapidly progressing towards building nuclear weapons, while U.S. intelligence assessments suggest Iran is not currently building them but may be under pressure to restart its nuclear program. The U.S. has publicly stated it is not involved in Israel's offensive, but Trump's recent social media posts have raised questions about the extent of U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard amid immigration enforcement protests in Los Angeles. Judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated they might have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops. The Trump administration argued that the deployment was justified due to violent riots and that the president's powers as commander-in-chief are unreviewable. California argued that the federalization was an unlawful executive action that interfered with state sovereignty and diverted guardsmen from critical work.</p>

          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Nasdaq-traded Chinese herb stock with no revenues, has experienced an extraordinary rally, increasing by 59,000% this year. The stock, which develops traditional Chinese herb treatments for childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, has seen its market value surpass that of established companies like Lululemon and Kraft Heinz. The surge coincides with increased interest in alternative medicines and a recent stock split designed to enhance liquidity. Despite the stock's volatility and the company's lack of revenue, it has attracted attention on social media, with some expressing skepticism about its business model (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clarified that singer Nezza is welcome back at Dodger Stadium after she sang the national anthem in Spanish, despite initial requests for her to sing it in English. Nezza's performance occurred on the same day as protests against President Trump's immigration policies, and she stated that she wanted to represent her community. While Nezza initially believed she was banned after receiving a call discouraging her from future performances, the Dodgers have reaffirmed that she is not banned. The team spokesperson confirmed she is welcome back at the stadium.</p>
