          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 15:32:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger reports that the Federal Reserve is widely expected to implement an interest rate cut this week to stimulate a weakening job market. The central bank faces a difficult balancing act, as inflation has begun to reaccelerate, partly due to tariffs impacting consumer prices. The labor market is currently described as 'no fire, no hire,' indicating that companies are not laying off existing staff but are also not creating new positions, making it difficult for new entrants. Schlesinger notes that this is one of the most challenging economic environments to navigate in the last 40 years. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape describes the current period in the United States as a 'watershed moment' for 'violent populism,' characterized by a rising tide of political violence from both the left and right. Citing his research, Pape warns that support for using force to achieve political goals is at its highest level in years, corresponding with an increase in actual attacks on political figures. He argues the root cause is not the internet itself, which is merely an accelerant, but rather a profound social change as the nation transitions to a white-minority democracy. Pape stresses that without intervention from political leaders to condemn violence, this dangerous trend will likely worsen over the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prominent political figures including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senators Chris Coons and James Lankford have called for national unity and a de-escalation of political rhetoric. They expressed deep concern that increasingly hostile language, such as calling opponents 'Nazis' or 'fascists,' creates an environment that can incite deranged individuals to violence. The leaders emphasized the need for civil discourse and are taking steps to enhance security for public officials who feel increasingly threatened. This moment is being viewed by some as a potential turning point for the country to return to more respectful debate.</p>

          <p>A long-simmering verbal feud between country music singers Zach Bryan and Gavin Adcock escalated into a physical confrontation at the Born & Raised Festival in Oklahoma. Video shared online shows the two artists yelling at each other through a chain-link fence before Bryan reportedly climbed over it, requiring security personnel to intervene. The dispute appears to stem from Adcock's previous public criticisms of Bryan, including calling him thin-skinned and questioning his character. The incident highlights a growing public rivalry between the two popular musicians.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has renewed its legal push to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, filing an appeal ahead of the central bank's upcoming vote on interest rates. The administration's 'for cause' removal is based on allegations that Cook committed mortgage fraud, a claim she denies and which a federal judge previously ruled was an illegal basis for her firing. This marks an unprecedented attempt by a president to remove a Fed governor, raising significant concerns about the historical independence of the central bank and the potential risks to the economy.

          <p>The recent fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has drawn fresh scrutiny to a state law passed just last month that permits open carrying of firearms on college campuses. Previously, firearms had to be concealed on university grounds. This new law is part of Utah's broader pro-Second Amendment legislative landscape, which includes permitless carry and lacks red-flag laws. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle used is still unclear, the timing of the event has pushed the campus carry law into the national debate over gun control and public safety.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has maintained its perfect start to the Premier League season through a series of dramatic, late-game victories, a trend now being dubbed 'Arne Time.' In a pattern reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, the team has won all four of its opening matches with winning goals scored in the final 10 minutes or in stoppage time. This resilience has allowed Liverpool to secure maximum points even when not performing at their peak, creating a psychological advantage over opponents and signaling a formidable winning mentality under manager Arne Slot.</p>

          <p>Members of the Sikh community gathered for a protest in Oldbury, West Midlands, to express solidarity with the victim of a recent sexual assault that police are treating as a racially aggravated attack. The victim, a woman in her 20s, was reportedly assaulted by two men who made racist remarks, telling her she did not belong in the country. Community leaders at the demonstration condemned the attack, called for justice, and urged local politicians to take stronger action to protect and unite communities in a climate of rising extremism.</p>

          <p>Modern theme parks, such as Universal's new $7 billion Epic Universe, are increasingly complex operations designed to provide an overwhelming and immersive form of entertainment. This article explores the intricate engineering behind these experiences, from using psychology to manage crowd flow and queue times to developing roller coasters that push the physical limits of the human body. To compete with at-home entertainment, parks are creating meticulously detailed worlds based on popular film franchises, aiming to create an escape so perfect that reality feels flawed in comparison. The goal is to create powerful, TikTok-like moments that demand to be experienced in person.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died earlier this year, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over her allegations of sexual abuse. In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Duke of York has not faced adequate consequences for his alleged actions. He argued that despite being stripped of royal duties, Prince Andrew should be held to the 'fullest extent of the law,' asserting that no one should be above investigation, regardless of their royal status.</p>

The vote is seen as a key test for the national government, with the AfD's gains in western Germany reflecting a broader rightward shift in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The rapid adoption of 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to the traditional credit card industry. While consumers are drawn to the short-term, interest-free installment plans, banks and credit issuers are growing concerned. A major issue is that BNPL loans are often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a 'giant black hole' in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a person's total debt and financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>
