          <p>Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, is financially supporting Texas House Democrats who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort. The funds cover essential costs like lodging and transport, enabling the lawmakers to remain out of state and prevent a quorum. This support comes amid threats of arrest from Governor Greg Abbott, while Democrats maintain all expenses are lawful and necessary to fight what they call a partisan power grab. The situation highlights a high-stakes political battle over voting maps in Texas.</p>

This strategy allows patients to buy weight-loss treatments at a significantly reduced cash price, bypassing insurance intermediaries. The move is a response to both the rise of compounded drugs impacting its market share and President Trump's demands for lower prescription costs.

          <p>The potential defunding of the EPA's Energy Star program, as part of proposed budget cuts, poses a significant risk to the commercial real estate sector. The program's Portfolio Manager tool is the fundamental infrastructure for tracking energy data, which landlords and governments rely on for compliance with climate policies and identifying efficiency upgrades. Its removal could disrupt billions in energy savings and complicate state and municipal energy regulations, leading to a fragmented and potentially more expensive system if privatized. Industry groups are actively lobbying to preserve the federally-managed program.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has greenlit the €13.5 billion construction of the Messina Strait Bridge, which will connect Sicily to the mainland and become the world's longest suspension bridge. The project, revived after multiple cancellations, is championed as a major driver for economic development in southern Italy, expected to be completed by 2032. Despite the approval, the project faces significant controversy over its high cost, environmental impact on migratory birds, and concerns about potential mafia interference and seismic risks in the region. The bridge is also being classified as defense-related infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The BBC has proceeded with broadcasting the new season of MasterChef, which was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired over misconduct allegations. The decision has sparked backlash, with some critics and former contestants suggesting the series should have been refilmed or axed. The broadcast episodes appear to be edited to minimize the hosts' banter and casual interactions, focusing more on the cooking competition itself. The BBC defended its choice, stating it was important for the contestants who participated in good faith.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney reported stronger-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings, largely due to significant growth in its streaming division and increased consumer spending at its theme parks. The direct-to-consumer streaming business, including Disney+, has become a key revenue driver, helping to offset the continued decline in traditional linear television.

          <p>A leading economic think tank, NIESR, has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves will need to implement "a moderate but sustained increase in taxes" to meet her own borrowing rules. The analysis projects a £41.2 billion shortfall, attributing it to weakening economic growth and watered-down welfare cuts. The report suggests the government faces a "trilemma" between its spending commitments, manifesto tax promises, and fiscal targets. This puts the Labour government in a difficult position, potentially forcing it to break its pledge not to raise taxes on working people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stanley Burkhardt, a 74-year-old former New Orleans detective with a history of child sexual abuse convictions, has been jailed again. He faces new allegations of illegally using social media to leave suggestive comments on photos of young men, violating the conditions of his recent release from a federal treatment facility for sexually dangerous persons. Burkhardt's career as a detective investigating child abuse ended in disgrace, and he has since been investigated in connection with unsolved murders. This latest arrest reinitiates a case that was previously unresolved, bringing him back into the criminal justice system.</p>

          <h2>FBI Data for 2024 Shows Violent Crime at Historic Lows, Contradicting Political Narratives</h2>

          <p>A new FBI report reveals that crime rates in the United States decreased significantly in 2024, with violent crime dropping to levels not seen since the 1960s. The data shows a 14.5% fall in murder and non-negligent manslaughter and a 4.5% decrease in overall violent crime compared to the previous year. These figures directly contradict the narrative of an out-of-control crime wave that was a central theme in the 2024 presidential election. The report indicates that the nation was safer during the final full year of the Biden administration, challenging claims of surging crime.</p>

          <p>The pseudonymous right-wing influencer known as Bronze Age Pervert (BAP) has published a critique of the Trump administration's tariff-heavy economic policies. In the essay, BAP argues that attempting to revive 1950s-style manufacturing jobs through protectionism is a misguided, nostalgic fantasy that cedes the future to China. This critique represents a notable ideological fissure on the far-right, pitting BAP's brand of Nietzschean fascism against the "common good" economic nationalism of figures like VP J.D. Vance. The article highlights an internal battle for the philosophical soul of the modern conservative movement.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have arrested a 37-year-old man suspected of being a serial killer who targeted homeless individuals. The suspect, known locally as the "machete man," allegedly lured at least five victims to his home, where he would murder and dismember them. A raid on his house uncovered bones, blood, and other human remains. The investigation began after security footage linked several missing persons cases to the same individual, and the suspect's nephew provided a chilling account of his uncle's activities to the police. The suspect has been charged with aggravated homicide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's tariffs, despite being economically and politically unpopular, could become a permanent feature of U.S. fiscal policy. The tariffs are projected to generate over $2.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, effectively acting as a major tax hike without congressional approval. With rising deficits and a political aversion to other forms of taxation, future administrations may be reluctant to repeal this significant revenue source. This creates a scenario where a flawed policy could be sustained by fiscal necessity and political convenience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been inaugurated as the new president of Poland. His victory could shift the country toward a more nationalist course and create challenges for the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. In his inaugural address, Nawrocki emphasized Polish sovereignty within the European Union and committed to strengthening the nation's military. His rapid rise from a political unknown to the presidency reflects a populist trend, with his supporters embracing his platform of traditional, patriotic values.</p>

The new regulator will also implement stronger ownership tests to prevent clubs from falling into peril. Nandy acknowledged the urgency of the situation, referencing past club collapses and promising fans that the government is working quickly to establish the new oversight body.</p>

However, many are not fully utilizing key financial tools like the FAFSA or tax-advantaged 529 savings plans. The rising costs and financial strain are also causing more young adults to reconsider the value of a traditional college education. (not investment advice)</p>

The FDA has recently announced plans to crack down on 7-OH, a compound in kratom, by initiating a process to classify it as an illicit substance.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed fighting potential Republican gerrymandering in Texas with a counter-measure in his own state. He suggests a ballot initiative that would ask California voters to approve a partisan redrawing of their own congressional maps, but only if Texas proceeds with its plan. This "fire with fire" strategy aims to neutralize any advantage Republicans might gain, but it raises significant democratic and ethical questions. The plan would require California voters to temporarily set aside their state's independent redistricting process, a move that could have long-term consequences.</p>

          <p>In California's intensely hot Imperial Valley, unhoused and undocumented communities face life-threatening summer temperatures with minimal support.

Outreach organizations are finding it harder to provide essential aid like water as people are more hidden and fearful. This confluence of extreme heat, insecure housing, and aggressive enforcement creates a perilous environment for the region's most marginalized residents.</p>
