          <p>A 76-year-old woman in Brooklyn was killed when a solar panel, torn loose by high winds from a nor'easter, struck her. The incident occurred as a wind advisory was in effect, with gusts unofficially reaching 42 mph. The Department of Buildings reported the panel flew approximately 20 feet from a carport structure before hitting the victim. In response, officials have implemented safety measures, including a partial closure of a nearby train entrance and the parking lot where the event took place, as the storm caused widespread issues like downed trees across the city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has provided a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina's central bank to address liquidity concerns and prevent a potential financial crisis. Announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the intervention aims to stabilize the volatile Argentine peso ahead of the country's key midterm elections. While the move is intended to support an important regional ally and calm credit markets, it has drawn criticism, with some experts questioning its necessity and the potential risks involved, given Argentina's history of debt defaults.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has issued a warning that the U.S. is heading towards one of its longest-ever government shutdowns, now in its 13th day. He urged Democrats to approve a "clean" budget without partisan additions to reopen federal agencies and ensure workers are paid. The shutdown began after Senate Democrats rejected the GOP's funding proposal. Johnson highlighted the impasse by quoting former President Obama's 2013 remarks on a similar situation, emphasizing the need for a straightforward continuing resolution to fund the government while longer-term negotiations proceed.</p>

          <p>Vodafone experienced a major network outage in the UK, leaving thousands of customers without broadband, 4G, and 5G services. According to the monitoring service Downdetector, over 130,000 reports were filed, with users complaining of an inability to work or access online services. The issue also impacted customers of other providers that use Vodafone's network, such as Voxi and Lebara. While the company acknowledged the "major issue" and worked to resolve it, the incident highlighted the widespread disruption caused by failures in critical digital infrastructure.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its third week, the Smithsonian Institution has closed all its museums and the National Zoo in Washington D.C. The closures are a direct result of the lapse in federal funding, which constitutes over 60% of the institution's budget. While essential staff will continue to care for the animals, public access and non-essential services, including the popular live animal cameras, have been suspended. This shutdown echoes the 2019 event, which caused the Smithsonian to lose an estimated one million visitors and millions in revenue.</p>

          <p>Despite its stock performance being stagnant recently, Meta Platforms has received a positive outlook from Citi, which placed the company on a "90-day catalyst watch." The firm's optimism is based on signs of growth in Meta's core advertising business and an increasing share of ad budgets, even as it faces new competition from OpenAI's video generation tool, Sora. Citi analysts believe these positive trends in advertising could serve as the catalyst to drive the stock higher, maintaining a "buy" rating with a price target of $915. (not investment advice)</p>

It clarifies that carrying a balance does not improve one's credit score and only results in paying unnecessary interest. The piece also warns that making only minimum payments is an ineffective strategy for debt reduction, as most of the payment goes toward interest charges. Finally, it explains that closing old credit card accounts can actually harm a credit score by reducing available credit and shortening credit history.</p>

          <h2>Stock Markets Rebound as President Trump Adopts Softer Tone on China Tariffs</h2>

          <p>U.S. stock markets saw a significant rebound on Monday, recovering from a sharp plunge at the end of the previous week. The rally was fueled by President Trump softening his stance on China after threatening a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports. His more conciliatory weekend comments eased investor fears of an escalating trade war, leading to gains across major indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Chipmakers were among the top performers, though analysts noted that market volatility could persist due to the ongoing trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant development has occurred in Madagascar's political crisis, as the CAPSAT unit of the armed forces has declared its support for the ongoing youth-led protests demanding the resignation of President Andry Rajoelina. The military unit urged all security forces to refuse orders to fire on demonstrators. Following this declaration, reports emerged that President Rajoelina, whose whereabouts are unconfirmed, has left the country. This shift in military allegiance mirrors the events of 2009 when the army's support was crucial in Rajoelina's own rise to power.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Brazil, Zhu Qingqiao, has committed to strengthening economic ties between the two nations while denouncing the "law of the jungle" approach of some global powers. His remarks were a clear criticism of the United States amid ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Brasilia. The U.S. recently imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods following the imprisonment of former president Jair Bolsonaro. This has pushed Brazil to seek closer relationships with alternative partners like China for both trade and investment opportunities.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca has finalized a deal with the Trump administration to lower drug prices for American consumers, becoming the first non-U.S. drugmaker to do so. The agreement shields the company from threatened tariffs and was the result of months of negotiations led by CEO Pascal Soriot. Key elements of the company's strategy included announcing billions in U.S. investments and cultivating relationships with administration officials. While AstraZeneca made some concessions on pricing, the deal provides market clarity and is viewed as a strategic victory for the pharmaceutical giant.</p>

          <p>A senior official at the Nobel Institute has stated that a suspected leak of this year's Peace Prize winner was "highly likely" the result of espionage. The statement came after betting odds for the winner, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, dramatically surged just hours before the official announcement. Kristian Berg Harpviken, the institute's director, told Norwegian media that while it's not certain, the Nobel Institute has long been a target for information gathering by state and other actors. The committee will investigate and tighten security measures in response to the incident.</p>
