          <p>The U.S. State Department released its yearly human rights review of China, which, while shorter due to a broader restructuring of country reports, maintains its significant criticisms of Beijing's actions. The report's release was delayed for months amid concerns that the Trump administration might soften its stance on human rights abuses. Unlike previous years, the release was not accompanied by a formal event led by the Secretary of State. These reports are crucial as they inform U.S. congressional decisions on foreign aid and are widely used in legal proceedings, particularly for asylum cases.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell by 11% in after-hours trading, even though the company reported second-quarter revenue and future guidance that surpassed analyst expectations. While revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, the company posted a net loss of $290.5 million and noted that its growth remains constrained by supply limitations. CoreWeave, which competes with major cloud providers by renting out Nvidia chips, also saw its operating margin shrink significantly due to stock-based compensation costs and an increase in debt to $11.1 billion.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not consider surrendering the Donbas region in any peace negotiations, particularly ahead of the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy expressed concern that ceding this territory would provide Russia with a strategic advantage for future offensives. His statement comes as Russian forces reportedly made a new 10km advance in the east, which he characterized as a Russian effort to create a narrative of momentum before the talks. Zelenskyy also conveyed his frustration at being excluded from the high-stakes summit in Alaska.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues in favor of President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington D.C. police force and deploy the National Guard. The author contends that the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government unique authority over the District of Columbia, making the action legally sound and necessary to restore law and order. The piece dismisses Democratic criticism by asserting that D.C. lacks the state sovereignty that would typically prevent such federal intervention. It frames the move as a fulfillment of the president's duty to ensure federal laws are faithfully executed in the nation's capital.</p>

The rebuke followed a research note from Goldman's Jan Hatzius, which predicted that American consumers would bear an increasing share of the costs from Trump's new tariffs. Trump refuted this, claiming on social media that tariffs were generating "massive amounts of CASH" for the U.S. Treasury and were not causing inflation. He accused the bank of making incorrect predictions and refusing to give his administration credit for its economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders. This pre-summit call comes as Zelenskyy noted a potential signal from Russia about its readiness to discuss a ceasefire, though he remains skeptical of Putin's true intentions. Zelenskyy has warned that Russia is simultaneously preparing for new military offensives, evidenced by a recent significant breakthrough on the eastern front. The discussions aim to align strategies and support for Ukraine's key demands ahead of Trump's face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses China's construction of a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River in Tibet, highlighting its dual nature as a clean energy project and a source of geopolitical tension. While the dam is expected to generate significant renewable energy and aid in China's carbon neutrality goals, it has raised serious concerns in downstream nations like India and Bangladesh about water security. The author argues that this situation, arising amidst already strained water-sharing agreements in South Asia, offers China a chance to build trust with India. Proactive diplomacy and transparent data-sharing could mitigate conflict and establish a framework for regional cooperation.</p>

In a town-hall with bureau employees, Lutnick also suggested that while everyone must be counted, the census should differentiate those in the U.S. without legal status.

According to government officials, the changes were made to align with "America First" values, introducing new categories like "Life" and "Liberty."

The reviewer notes that experiencing the play in this specific environment heightened their awareness of the historical through-lines and the deep, empathetic connection between the story and the audience.

          <p>Tesla is actively hiring vehicle operators in New York City to test its "automated driving systems," even though the company has not applied for the required state or city permits to conduct such tests. A job posting seeks drivers in Queens for data collection, following a similar recruitment effort in Brooklyn. Officials from both the New York City Department of Transportation and the state's DMV confirmed that Tesla has not submitted the necessary applications. This move comes as Tesla pushes its AI and robotics-focused future, while competitors like Waymo are proceeding through the official application process for testing in the state.</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F) in several locations. The sustained period of hot, dry weather has led to "nationally significant" water shortfalls, according to the national drought group. This has resulted in widespread environmental damage, increased wildfire risk, and the implementation of hosepipe bans for millions of people. The heat has also disrupted rail services and created challenging conditions for farmers. Experts warn that these extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, signaling a growing crisis for the nation's systems.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Debt Forgiveness Remains a Sensible Strategy Despite Steady Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that pursuing debt forgiveness or settlement remains a logical financial strategy for consumers, even with inflation holding steady. While a stable inflation rate of 2.7% is positive for the economy, it does not alleviate the burden of high-interest credit card debt, where average rates are near 22%. The piece contends that the vast difference between the inflation rate and credit card interest rates makes carrying a balance extremely costly. Given ongoing economic uncertainties, such as the potential impact of tariffs, proactively reducing high-rate debt through settlement provides more financial security than waiting for potential future relief.

          <p>The iconic Buck Owens' Crystal Palace in Bakersfield, a celebrated restaurant and music venue, has abruptly closed its doors after 28 years. The venue, founded by the country music legend, was a temple for the "Bakersfield Sound" and hosted countless stars, from Willie Nelson to Taylor Swift. The closure, attributed to pandemic after-effects, a tough economy, and the aging of the family members running it, has prompted an outpouring of grief from fans. Many are now publicly appealing to country music stars who played there, like Dwight Yoakam and Garth Brooks, to purchase and save the historic establishment.</p>

The new projection is 4% to 6%, down from a previous range of 6% to 8%. The revision came after second-quarter same-store sales rose only 2.1%, significantly missing Wall Street's expectation of 6.1% growth. Cava's executives attributed the slowdown to the difficulty of comparing against the previous year's strong performance, which was boosted by the successful launch of a grilled steak option.

This data increased investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will have the justification it needs to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting.

          <p>The White House has responded to California Governor Gavin Newsom's threat of a lawsuit over the freezing of federal grants to UCLA with the message, "Bring it on, Gavin." The conflict stems from the Trump administration's demand for over $1 billion and sweeping campus changes to resolve federal findings of antisemitism and other policy violations. Newsom has labeled the move "extortion" and a "political shakedown." The freeze affects hundreds of research grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation, threatening vital research into cancer and other fields and potentially forcing budget cuts and layoffs at the university.</p>
