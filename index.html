          <p>China will continue to impose a 10% extra tariff while suspending an additional 24% tariff. The announcement comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between China and the United States, signaling a complex approach to trade relations. This decision reflects China's strategy in managing trade tensions and protecting its economic interests during these discussions. It is unclear how this decision will impact the negotiations overall, but it indicates a cautious approach from China. The international community is closely watching the developments in these trade talks.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days to de-escalate the trade war. Officials from both countries said they would suspend tariffs while they negotiate a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship. Under the agreement, the United States would reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China would lower import duties on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling of the two economies.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a Class A misdemeanor for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The new law carries penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine, expanding on a 2010 law that created an animal abuse registry. County Executive Ed Romaine emphasized the county's commitment to protecting animals, while Legislator Stephanie Bontempi highlighted the closure of a loophole in the existing law. The expanded legislation was enacted shortly after dozens of dead cats were discovered in a Long Island home.</p>

McIlroy has won multiple times at Quail Hollow, including victories in 2021 and 2024, and feels comfortable with the course's layout and the support from the Charlotte community. The course setup will be tougher than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens to challenge the field.

          <p>An essay discusses a student-led movement in Serbia that is challenging the country's increasingly autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. The movement was catalyzed by a train station collapse in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people and sparked protests against corruption. Despite government attempts to undermine the protests, a massive demonstration occurred on March 15, with close to half a million people filling the streets of Belgrade. The article highlights the movement's unique approach, operating without leaders or hierarchies and emphasizing solidarity and horizontal decision-making.</p>

The release is intended to facilitate the reopening of crossings into Gaza and the resumption of aid delivery. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it was aware of Hamas' plan to release Alexander and that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of other hostages.</p>

          <p>Landmark China-US trade talks are seen as carrying economic and political significance for both sides while kick-starting a long process toward substantive deals. The apparent upbeat move in Geneva stands to give both powers interim political relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war battlefront. Chinese and US negotiators agreed to establish a “trade consultation mechanism”, with the White House releasing a statement describing the “China trade deal” and citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comment of “substantial progress”.</p>

The proposal, which is one piece of a sweeping bill to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda, omits the structural changes to Medicaid that ultraconservative Republicans have demanded. Overall, the legislation would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion over the decade and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, according to a partial analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to begin feasibility studies into their return, as elk are considered a "keystone" species that can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. The funding will pay for a disease risk assessment, and the project will consult with local communities and landowners. The successful reintroduction of beavers to parts of the UK could help guide the project.</p>
