          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in Texas, particularly near critical infrastructure such as military bases and food processing plants. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse land deals that pose risks to public health or safety. Exemptions are included for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents intending to use the property as a personal homestead. The bill is set to take effect September 1 and aims to secure the homeland from foreign espionage and influence.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives, such as a 25% tax rebate, as well as lower labor costs and centralized national funding for film. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major U.S. film studios and streaming giants, amounting to Â£1.37 billion. The article discusses how President Trump's proposal to impose tariffs on foreign-made films could impact the industry and potentially increase costs for moviegoers. It also highlights several films shot in the UK, including Barbie, Jurassic World: Dominion, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p>

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for undocumented migrants. Miller justified this by arguing that the U.S. is facing a national security threat due to an "invasion" of migrants. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally. The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus only in cases of rebellion or invasion when public safety requires it.</p>

Meanwhile, Pakistan, facing economic and political crises, is unwilling to back down on issues like Kashmir.

          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs on China, suggesting "80% Tariff on China seems right!" on his social media platform. This conciliatory tone comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The talks represent the first publicly announced meeting between the two nations since the trade war began, and investors are hoping for a resolution that reduces tariffs further. UBS Global Wealth Management suggests tariffs may ultimately settle around 34%.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels, warning of naturally occurring toxins that make them potentially poisonous to humans from May 1 to October 31. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be deadly. The quarantine covers the entire California coastline, and there are no known antidotes for these toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing.</p>
