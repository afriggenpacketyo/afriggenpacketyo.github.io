        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The international player union FIFPRO has highlighted the extreme physical strain on elite footballers, using Moroccan star Achraf Hakimi as a prime example. Last season, Hakimi played 69 matches, far exceeding the recommended limit of 55, and his demanding schedule for club and country left him with only a 22-day offseason. The report expresses concern that such an intense workload, especially for young players, increases long-term injury risks and diminishes performance. FIFPRO has initiated legal action against FIFA over the congested football calendar, advocating for better player protection.</p>

          <p>A former NYPD lieutenant suggests New York City's alarming rise in juvenile crime is linked to the state's 2018 "Raise the Age Law," which increased the age of criminal responsibility to 18. The expert argues that gangs are now incentivized to use minors to carry out violent acts, knowing they will likely avoid being tried as adults. Statistics show a significant increase in major felonies committed by juveniles and a sharp rise in youth shooting victims since the law was enacted. This trend has become a central issue in the city's upcoming mayoral race.</p>

          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free U.S. market access for 35 sub-Saharan nations, is set to expire. This poses immediate risks of job losses in key sectors like textiles, particularly for economies like Lesotho and South Africa. However, some economists view the end of AGOA as a historic opportunity for African nations to reduce economic dependency and strengthen the African Continental Free Trade Area. The deal's expiration may also accelerate Africa's pivot toward other trading partners, such as China and the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is collaborating with cybersecurity specialists and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to ensure a secure and safe recovery process. The production halt has caused significant financial strain on JLR's vast supply chain, prompting the government to provide £1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support the affected businesses during the disruption.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has stated that the U.S. is actively considering Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, which possess a range capable of reaching Moscow. This potential arms provision would fall under a policy where European NATO allies finance the weaponry, a strategy designed to increase European investment in Ukraine's defense. The consideration of such a significant military upgrade comes as President Trump reportedly grows more frustrated with Russia's unwillingness to engage in peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist living in exile, was denied entry to Singapore despite holding a valid visa for an event. Law, who is wanted by the Hong Kong government under its sweeping National Security Law, was detained at the airport and put on a flight back to San Francisco. While Singaporean authorities stated his presence was not in the country's 'national interests,' Law believes the decision was politically motivated, possibly due to pressure from the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>German airline Lufthansa has confirmed its intention to eliminate 4,000 administrative jobs by the year 2030. The company plans to achieve these cuts by leveraging artificial intelligence, increasing digitalization, and implementing efficiency savings across its member airlines. This move is part of a larger strategy to centralize control and improve profitability, focusing on non-operational roles. The announcement has drawn criticism from the German trade union Verdi, which has pledged to oppose the cuts.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated assertions of a surge in new U.S. auto factory construction, an analysis of the industry's actions reveals a different picture. Automakers are primarily investing in retooling existing plants to avoid tariffs and are shifting production away from electric vehicles back to gasoline-powered ones. This activity often involves reversing previously announced EV projects rather than breaking ground on new facilities, challenging the administration's narrative of a widespread manufacturing boom driven by new foreign investment.
