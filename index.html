          <p>A new study from China details an advanced AI-driven system reportedly capable of detecting stealth submarines with 95% accuracy by integrating data from various underwater sources. This technology aims to create real-time environmental maps and provide military personnel with simplified, actionable intelligence. While some Western military experts express skepticism about its immediate implementation due to the complexity of the underwater environment, the development raises significant questions about the future of naval warfare and the stability of the nuclear triad, which relies on the stealth of ballistic missile submarines.</p>

          <p>West Ham head coach Graham Potter is facing significant job insecurity following a poor start to the season, culminating in a recent home defeat to Crystal Palace. The club is reportedly already identifying potential replacements, with names like Nuno Espirito Santo and Gary O'Neil being considered. Having won only six of his 25 matches in charge, Potter's position is precarious, as the team has lost all three home games this season and has not secured a Premier League victory at their own stadium since February.</p>

This streak ties the New York Yankees for the second-longest in MLB history. While Kershaw did not get the win, the game marked a significant moment for the franchise legend. The Dodgers have not yet clinched the NL West division title but are focused on that as their next objective before the postseason begins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military has issued new rules for journalists at the Pentagon, requiring them to sign a pledge restricting their movements and agreeing not to gather any information, even if unclassified, that has not been officially approved for release. Those who refuse to sign will have their press passes revoked, a move that severely limits media access within the building. This policy, implemented under the recently rebranded Department of War, has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom advocates who argue it functions as a prior restraint on independent reporting and undermines public transparency.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England, including shows in Boston and Connecticut, after receiving a credible death threat. The threat was reportedly made online by a 26-year-old man in Ottawa, Canada, who has since been charged by local police. The Boston venue, MGM Music Hall, announced the cancellation as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the artist and his band. Morrissey, the former frontman of The Smiths, has been a solo artist since 1987.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new policy imposing a $100,000 annual fee for each H-1B visa, a program heavily utilized by the technology and finance sectors for skilled immigrant workers.

Foreign governments, particularly India, have expressed concern over the significant financial and humanitarian consequences of the abrupt policy change, which represents one of the administration's most aggressive actions to restrict legal immigration.

          <p>A commentary article argues that the new, ultra-thin iPhone Air reflects a broader, undesirable cultural shift toward a bland and sterile minimalism. The author contends that this aesthetic, seen in everything from interior design to theater productions, strips away character and context in favor of inoffensive, cold efficiency. This trend is contrasted with the bold, colorful designs of past technology like the 1998 iMac. The article suggests that this pervasive minimalism is a form of control, presenting a clean facade that conceals a chaotic and uncontrolled world.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its newly acquired "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These special powers, which grant the White House veto authority over strategic decisions, were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned against the closure, the company reversed its decision, marking the first time the administration has exercised this authority to influence corporate operations directly.

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky discussed her journey of healing and reclaiming her narrative after the 1998 scandal that made her a target of global scorn. She explained that her decision to speak out in 2014 was partly inspired by the tragic suicide of Tyler Clementi, hoping she could be a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky noted the significant cultural shift since the 1990s, with younger generations and movements like #MeToo fostering greater empathy and providing the language to understand abuses of power, which has helped reframe her experience.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has raised hopes for increased stability in the relationship between the two nations. Following the discussion, which covered trade and TikTok, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a potential visit to China early next year. While both sides described the talks as constructive, analysts remain cautious, pointing to ongoing friction over Taiwan, the South China Sea, and potential U.S. tariffs related to China's purchases of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>The United States has become less public about its naval warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. While such operations were regularly announced under the previous administration as a display of freedom of navigation, there have been only three known transits this year, all confirmed only after media inquiries. Beijing has historically criticized the "public hype" surrounding these missions. Some Chinese observers view this shift as a tactical change rather than a substantive alteration of U.S. policy in the region.</p>

          <p>A leading dermatologist highlights a common misconception about sun protection, explaining that harmful UVA rays can penetrate window glass, exposing people to skin damage even while indoors. While UVB rays, which cause sunburn, are largely blocked by windows, UVA rays contribute to accelerated skin aging and cancer risk. The article emphasizes the importance of using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily to protect against both types of ultraviolet radiation. Consistent reapplication is also recommended for those spending extended time outdoors or near windows.</p>

          <p>Food industry experts identify three primary factors behind the recent surge in U.S. grocery bills: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a domestic shortage of farm workers. Tariffs have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production to other countries. At the same time, immigration policies and waning interest in agricultural jobs have created a labor deficit. These combined pressures lead to higher costs for producers, which are then passed on to consumers at the checkout.</p>
