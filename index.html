          <p>Leading global insurers are raising alarms that the escalating climate crisis could soon make entire regions of the world uninsurable, posing a significant threat to the global economy. An executive from Allianz warned that rising global temperatures are degrading asset classes in real time and could lead to a situation where financial services like mortgages can no longer be covered. The article highlights a growing 'protection gap,' where economic losses from natural disasters, which have grown faster than global GDP, are increasingly uninsured. Experts suggest that without rapid decarbonization and investment in adaptation, the current economic model is unsustainable.</p>

          <p>The latest global rhino census presents a mixed picture for the five remaining species, with some populations showing recovery while others face dire threats. The report indicates a positive growth in the numbers of critically endangered Black rhinos in Africa and greater one-horned rhinos in Asia, showcasing conservation successes. However, the situation is grim for Indonesia's Javan and Sumatran rhinos, whose populations are on the verge of extinction due to poaching and habitat loss. Additionally, the number of white rhinos in Africa has slightly decreased, primarily due to a concerning resurgence in poaching activities in South Africa.</p>

          <p>A new BBC podcast explores the complex and contradictory life of Margaret 'Big Mags' Haney, a Scottish grandmother who gained fame in the 1990s as a vigilante 'paedophile hunter.' Initially celebrated by the media for her mob justice tactics, her public image soured when it was revealed that she was the matriarch of a family responsible for a local crime wave. The story took an even darker turn when an investigation exposed her as the head of a massive heroin-dealing empire, leading to a 12-year prison sentence. The article delves into her dual identity as a community protector and a feared criminal, leaving a complicated legacy.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a military plan to expand its ground operations and take control of Gaza City, a move that signals a significant escalation in the nearly two-year-long conflict. This decision comes despite the area housing some of the last functioning hospitals and tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians. The plan aims for the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of Israeli security control, though details remain vague. The announcement has drawn criticism and fear from the families of Israeli hostages, who are demanding a ceasefire and worry about the safety of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, has been sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to attack Maryland's power grid. The plot, organized with his girlfriend, aimed to trigger societal collapse by targeting the energy infrastructure of the majority-Black city of Baltimore. During sentencing, the judge condemned Russell's white supremacist ideology, identifying him as the 'intellectual horsepower' behind the plan to create a racist utopia. This conviction follows a previous sentence for Russell related to the possession of explosive materials discovered during a homicide investigation.</p>

          <p>A leaked internal report accuses His Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) in the UK of a cover-up regarding a persistent IT bug that caused legal evidence to be lost or overwritten for years. The flaw in the case-management software affected civil, family, and tribunal courts, with sources fearing that judges made rulings based on incomplete information. The report reveals that HMCTS management knew of the 'large scale' data breaches but decided not to inform judges or lawyers, fearing it would cause more harm. This situation has drawn comparisons to the Post Office Horizon scandal, raising serious concerns about potential miscarriages of justice.</p>

The French government is accused of colluding with the industry to conceal the issue, which critics have dubbed France's 'Water-gate.'

          <p>A new study in Science Advances quantifies a trend long felt by Californians, finding that the state's fire season now begins approximately six weeks earlier than it did in the 1990s. Researchers attribute this significant shift primarily to human-caused climate change, which leads to earlier snowmelt and drier conditions for flammable vegetation. The effect is particularly pronounced in Northern California, where in some areas the fire season is now nearly year-round. The study rules out human-caused ignitions as the driver, as those have decreased, definitively linking the longer, more destructive fire seasons to rising global temperatures.</p>

          <h2>Trump's New Semiconductor Tariffs Could Shift Economic Balance in Southeast Asia Towards China, Analysts Suggest</h2>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on semiconductors and chips is raising concerns among analysts that the policy could inadvertently strengthen China's economic influence in Southeast Asia. The duties, which exempt companies with a significant U.S. manufacturing presence, add to the economic pressures the region is already facing from Trump's 'America First' trade policies. Experts suggest that the unpredictability of U.S. policy, combined with these new tariffs, could push Southeast Asian nations to deepen their economic ties with Beijing as a more stable alternative, thus tilting the regional balance.

          <p>Significant uncertainty surrounds the possibility of a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as a U.S.-imposed deadline for Moscow to show progress on ending the war in Ukraine arrives. Trump has walked back a previous condition that he would only meet Putin if Ukrainian President Zelenskyy were also present. While Putin expressed hope for a meeting, he also distanced himself from the idea of meeting Zelenskyy soon, stating conditions are not yet right. This diplomatic maneuvering occurs as the White House prepares to potentially implement further sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>For the first time ever, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially sighted and confirmed in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, whose identity was verified by experts. This species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe in recent decades, a movement believed to be at least partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant event for British fauna, it is not yet known if the species will establish a breeding population.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census, this article explains the complexities of the decennial count. The Constitution mandates a full enumeration of the population every 10 years to determine congressional representation, a massive undertaking that cannot be changed quickly. While the Trump administration's previous attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court, the legal door was not entirely closed. The article details how the census works, its long planning cycle, and the significant impact any changes would have on political power and resource allocation across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as 'highly conflicted' in a post on Truth Social. The president's demand, which caused a dip in Intel's stock price, did not provide specific details but followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton. The senator's letter raised concerns about Tan's extensive investments and ties to Chinese businesses, including some allegedly linked to the Chinese military. Intel has not yet responded to the president's call for its CEO, who was appointed in March, to step down from his position.</p>

          <p>Police records from Las Vegas reveal that Shane Tamura, the man who killed four people in a New York City shooting, had been placed on two emergency psychiatric holds in recent years. Despite these documented mental health crises, during which his mother reported he was suicidal, he was still able to legally purchase the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack. Experts explain that under Nevada law, temporary 72-hour mental health holds are not automatically reported to the national background check system for gun purchases. The case highlights a potential gap in 'red flag' laws designed to prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning a $300 million superyacht, the Amadea, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch as part of efforts to pressure Russia over the war in Ukraine. The 348-foot vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features a helideck, a mosaic pool with a submerged bar, and a marble fireplace. The Justice Department maintains the ship was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, an oligarch sanctioned for money laundering and ties to Vladimir Putin. The sealed-bid auction, which requires a $10 million deposit, offers a rare opportunity to purchase an emblem of the lavish oligarch lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and embracing a more old-fashioned approach by attending in-person events. The article highlights the success of groups like Date Cincy, which hosts events for people seeking genuine face-to-face connections, free from the potential misrepresentation of online profiles. This trend coincides with a significant drop in the market value of apps like Bumble and a rise in attendance at singles events. For many, the chance to experience authentic, real-time chemistry is proving more appealing than swiping through digital profiles.</p>
