          <p>Amidst escalating US-China trade tensions, China is strategically leveraging President Trump's tariffs to bolster its own economic independence. Trump's approach, which involves temporarily exempting other nations from tariffs to pressure them into limiting ties with China, is inadvertently pushing China towards self-reliance. Beijing is implementing countercyclical policies, including a substantial debt swap plan for local governments, to stimulate domestic demand and reduce dependence on the US market, aiming to achieve economic growth through internal consumption and transparent debt management. This shift marks a determined effort by China to transform itself into a major consumer market, utilizing fiscal and monetary policies to navigate the challenges posed by US trade actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the legal journal selected articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. This action comes amid ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and concerns about antisemitism on campus, which previously led to a freeze on federal grants. The investigations by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services will scrutinize the Law Review's membership and article selection policies to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based discrimination in federally funded programs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has decided to provide relief to automakers by adjusting tariffs, a move seen as a partial retreat from his aggressive trade policies. The decision, expected to be formally announced ahead of a Michigan rally, aims to prevent the accumulation of tariffs on imported foreign cars and auto parts. This adjustment will allow importers of foreign auto parts to receive some reimbursement for tariffs over the next two years, incentivizing domestic manufacturing while providing a grace period for those needing to invest in domestic plants. While the United Auto Workers have praised the auto tariffs for potentially creating jobs, automakers have expressed concerns about the high costs.</p>

          <p>Robert Castillo, 61, of Fresno, has been charged with the murder of Barbara Lee, who was found dead in 2004, as well as two separate sexual assault cases from the early 2000s. Detectives linked Castillo to the crimes using DNA samples and believe he may be responsible for other unsolved cases. Authorities are urging anyone with information about Castillo to come forward, as the investigation continues to uncover the full extent of his alleged crimes. The charges include murder, sexual penetration by force, and rape.</p>

The sugar tax, known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), may be applied to dairy-based drinks and non-dairy substitutes like oat or rice milk. Additionally, the government proposes reducing the maximum sugar allowance in drinks before they are subject to the levy. Industry groups have expressed concerns about the plans, citing inflationary pressures and the progress already made in reducing sugar content in drinks. The consultation will run until July 21.</p>

He anticipates a robust labor report, making it difficult for the U.S. to slip into a full-blown recession soon.
