        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank announced it has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after Saudi Arabia and Qatar made the payments, enabling the country to receive grants for reconstruction and economic recovery. This move follows President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria and a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. DP World has also signed an $800-million agreement to develop the port of Tartus, reflecting growing confidence in Syria's stability. However, sectarian violence, infrastructure damage, and displaced populations continue to pose challenges for the war-torn nation.</p>

          <p>Yiyun Li's new memoir, "Things in Nature Merely Grow," delves into the suicides of her two sons, James and Vincent, and her struggles with grief and language's limitations in expressing such profound loss. Li confronts the pain of missing her children and rejects the idea of overcoming loss, choosing instead to live with the pain as a permanent part of her life. The article highlights Li's routine-driven approach to coping, including teaching and writing, and her acceptance of both sadness and joy. Li emphasizes respecting her sons' choices and trusting in her and her husband's ability to endure the pain, and not necessarily conforming to societal expectations of how a grieving mother should behave.</p>

Despite his assassination of a top Japanese official, his captors preserved his calligraphy, reflecting the complex cultural and political dynamics of early 20th-century East Asia.

Authorities believe the escapees likely had assistance and have changed out of their jail clothes.

This move comes as professional sports leagues increasingly open to private equity investment, with the NFL being the latest to approve such investments.

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul resulted in an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each, marking the largest prisoner swap of the conflict. However, the two sides failed to broker a temporary cease-fire, with Russia demanding Ukraine withdraw from the four annexed regions in east Ukraine. Both delegations agreed to share their visions for a possible cease-fire and meet again in principle, but Ukrainian President Zelensky criticized the talks as a "staged, empty process." Despite the lack of progress on a cease-fire, the talks represent a tactical win for Russia, who managed to start the talks without agreeing to a battlefield cease-fire first.</p>

An analysis estimates that these cuts could leave 8.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans claim the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, many worry about reduced access to care and having to choose between healthcare and basic necessities.

          <p>The Federal Reserve will reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, according to a memo from Chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will involve consolidating functions, modernizing practices, and offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees. This move comes as the Trump administration pushes for cost cuts across civil service agencies, although Powell's memo did not explicitly cite this as a factor. The central bank had just under 24,000 employees in 2023, so a 10% reduction would bring that number below 22,000.</p>

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling aircraft, the 737 Max. In an online meeting with relatives of those who died in the two accidents, officials for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. The move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty.</p>

          <p>Many airlines, hotels, and analysts are forecasting a downbeat tourism season in the United States, with threats of tariffs and unpopular policy decisions taking their toll. Canadian travel to the United States is down, and airlines have reduced fares in response to softening demand. Political and economic confusion created by the Trump administration’s “America First” agenda is causing both domestic and international tourists to reconsider their plans. The tourism industry projects a drop in international visitors that will cost the United States $12.5 billion in travel spending this year.</p>

Trump's approach emphasized transactions over principles, downplaying democracy and human rights issues in favor of economic partnerships.
