          <p>President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, marking his first military commencement address since his return to office. The speech comes amid the Trump administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Recent changes include disbanding several student clubs focused on race and gender and removing books related to diversity from academy libraries, actions criticized by some as hindering education and debate. The president's address and the surrounding policy changes highlight ongoing tensions between promoting inclusivity and adhering to specific ideological viewpoints within military education.</p>

          <p>An upcoming Spending Review in the UK is expected to reveal significant budget decisions before the next general election, with insiders predicting an 'ugly' process as government departments compete for funding. While overall government spending is increasing due to tax rises, certain sectors like health and defense are prioritized, creating a squeeze on day-to-day spending for other services. The review will set government budgets until 2029, influencing the political landscape for years to come. The focus is on capital spending for long-term projects like infrastructure, while departments providing daily public services face potential cuts.</p>
