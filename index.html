          <p>This article explores the contrasting experiences of two homeowners who discovered Banksy artworks on their properties. One homeowner in Margate found a piece addressing domestic violence, which is expected to sell for over Â£1 million with proceeds going to charity. The other homeowner in Lowestoft faced challenges preserving and potentially selling a large seagull mural, incurring significant costs. The article highlights the complexities and unexpected burdens that come with owning a Banksy, including public interference and preservation costs, with one expert suggesting simply painting over unwanted pieces.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked visas for all South Sudanese passport holders in response to South Sudan's refusal to accept its citizens being deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that this action was necessary to ensure that every country accepts the return of its citizens. This decision comes amid growing fears that South Sudan, the world's newest country, may descend into civil war, further complicating the situation for South Sudanese nationals in the US. The US had previously granted Temporary Protected Status to South Sudanese citizens, which was set to expire soon.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave for allegedly failing to "zealously advocate" for the government's interests in a case involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, struggled to provide Judge Paula Xinis with details surrounding the deportation. August Flentje, Reuveni's supervisor, was also placed on administrative leave for "failure to supervise a subordinate."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the implications of President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every product entering the US, arguing that it marks a turning point away from globalization. It suggests that the US is reverting to protectionist policies not seen in a century, potentially sparking a global trade war. The rationale behind these tariffs, framed as "reciprocal," is questioned, and the long-term aim of reducing the US trade deficit to zero is criticized as unrealistic. The article also examines the potential impact on US consumers and businesses, as well as the broader global trading system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Government attorneys argue that the judge did not have the authority to order the executive branch to engage with a foreign power in such a way. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a previous ruling protecting him from deportation. The White House maintains that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, a claim disputed by his attorneys.</p>

However, video footage from a paramedic's phone showed the vehicles were clearly marked and had lights on.
