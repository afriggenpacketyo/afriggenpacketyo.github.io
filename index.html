          <p>President Trump is hosting a roundtable event at the White House where CEOs from Uber, Dell, Goldman Sachs, and other companies are expected to announce billions in investments into "Trump accounts" for the children of their employees. This program, previously known as "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The House has already passed the provision to create these accounts as part of a larger budget bill, but it is currently facing pushback in the Senate from fiscally conservative Republicans who are demanding major changes. The event, titled "Invest America," aims to promote the pilot program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in a Supreme Court case, Social Security Administration v. AFSCME, expressing concerns over the court's handling of cases involving the Trump administration. Jackson argues that the court's Republican justices are circumventing normal court procedures to expedite Trump administration cases through the "shadow docket," which involves emergency motions decided without full briefing or oral argument. She believes the court has abandoned the requirement of showing "irreparable harm" before granting relief on the shadow docket, applying a more lenient standard to Republican administrations compared to Democratic ones. The case involved the Department of Government Efficiency accessing sensitive information from the Social Security Administration, highlighting a division within the court regarding its authority and procedures.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 22 years for attempting to murder his colleague, Graeme Perks. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, intending to set the house on fire, motivated by disciplinary proceedings against him in which Perks was a witness. Perks sustained life-threatening injuries after being stabbed in the abdomen but survived due to quick action and surgical skill. The case faced numerous delays due to Brooks's refusal to engage with the proceedings, including multiple failures to attend hearings and sacking his legal representatives, demonstrating a deliberate attempt to obstruct justice.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will be split into two separate companies, reversing CEO David Zaslav's initial vision of a mega-media company. One company will focus on streaming and studios, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. movie and television studios, while the other will focus on cable networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, and Discovery. This decision comes just over three years after Zaslav acquired Warner Media, taking on significant debt in the process, and follows a series of moves to pay down that debt, including layoffs and the cancellation of CNN's streaming service. The split is expected to close by mid-2026, pending IRS assessment, and raises questions about the future ownership and direction of CNN.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that it would be a "great thing" if border czar Tom Homan arrested California Governor Gavin Newsom, amidst ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles. Trump accused the protesters of being "professional agitators" and "insurrectionists" who should be jailed. Newsom responded on social media, condemning Trump's statement as an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism and an alarming abuse of power. Trump also defended his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, criticizing Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass for not being grateful enough for his assistance, despite their claims that it escalated the violence.</p>

Reeves plans to increase funding for the NHS, schools, and defense, along with infrastructure projects, to be detailed in Wednesday's Spending Review. While Treasury borrowing rules have been loosened to free up Â£113bn for infrastructure investment, budget cuts will be necessary elsewhere to meet fiscal rules. The Home Office had argued for maintaining police numbers, and Reeves has reversed a decision to remove Winter Fuel payments from most pensioners, costing an estimated Â£1.25bn.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained overnight, with all prisoners returned to their cells after officers deployed chemical agents. The incident began when inmates refused to return to their cells, leading to a multi-agency response. Three guards were held hostage but were safely released with minor injuries. CoreCivic, the company that runs the facility, stated that inmates created safety hazards by attempting to destroy property, compromising security cameras, and setting small fires, with one correctional officer sustaining minor injuries.</p>

          <p>The government has largely reversed its cuts to winter fuel payments, raising questions about its spending plans and fiscal rules. Initially, the government planned to provide winter fuel payments only to pensioners receiving pension credit, but after criticism, it will now provide payments to all pensioners, clawing them back in the following tax year from individuals earning Â£35,000 and above. This change will cost Â£1.25bn, resulting in a saving of Â£450m compared to the original system, but some analysts believe the net saving could be lower due to increased pension credit claims. The Treasury will address the resulting Â£1bn gap in the next Budget in the Autumn of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to activate the National Guard in California to quell protests over the weekend has been met with objections from Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the move illegal and vowed to sue. Trump invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406, claiming it was necessary to protect ICE officers being hindered from arresting illegal immigrants. Attorney Brad Moss notes that the law is designed to address rebellions, and while presidents can technically tap the National Guard without a governor's consent, there are limitations on its use. Newsom blamed Trump for exacerbating riots, arguing that local and state police had the situation under control before the military was called in.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* defends the "wife guy" identity, arguing that publicly expressing love for one's wife should not be viewed with suspicion. The author reflects on how his own expressions of adoration have been noticed and judged, leading him to consider the reasons behind the skepticism towards men who openly display affection for their spouses. He suggests that the term "wife guy" has evolved into a pejorative, implying that such displays are insincere or compensatory, but argues that vulnerability and openness are essential aspects of love and marriage. The author concludes that he is content with being known as a "guy who loves his wife a lot," regardless of the nicknames it may bring.</p>

          <p>A senior adviser to Pete Hegseth, Justin Fulcher, made false claims about NSA wiretaps to help with a Pentagon leak investigation, leading to the firing of three top aides. Fulcher suggested he knew of warrantless surveillance that identified the leakers, but he had no evidence of a wiretap. Before investigators debunked Fulcher's claims, Trump advisers were informed of "smoking gun" evidence, and Hegseth fired the aides. The episode adds to the growing portrait of dysfunction inside Hegseth's front office, which is involved in setting the direction of a department that has a budget of nearly $1tn and oversees more than 2 million troops around the world.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order calling for deep-sea mining in both federal and international waters, which is a violation of international law as the U.S. is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's fire insurer of last resort, is facing scrutiny for its lack of transparency. Unlike other insurers, it doesn't publicly disclose basic financial data, and its board meetings, minutes, audits, and reports are secret. Recent rules mean that anyone with property insurance will now pay to cover the FAIR plan's debts, increasing the importance of public oversight. Following investigations, the California FAIR Plan agreed to publicly disclose more information, including the composition of its board, its reinsurance structure and the dates of cash distributions back to its member companies.</p>
