          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned under pressure after a conflict with the Trump administration regarding a gift for King Charles III. Arrington resisted a request to give an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection, arguing it was the property of the American people. He instead helped procure a replica Cadet Saber from West Point for the state visit. Arrington stated he was told to "resign — or be fired," allegedly for being untrustworthy with confidential information related to the incident and a separate construction matter on the library grounds.</p>

          <p>An expedition team from Purdue University is preparing to investigate a "visual anomaly" in a lagoon on the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro, believing it could be Amelia Earhart's lost Electra 10E aircraft. The object, visible in satellite imagery dating back to 1938, aligns with a theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed and were marooned on the island in 1937. Researchers will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object for identification. If confirmed, Purdue University, which originally funded the plane, hopes to bring the historic aircraft back to its campus in Indiana.</p>

          <p>A terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, during Yom Kippur resulted in two deaths and multiple injuries, underscoring a sharp rise in antisemitism. The assailant, who was killed by police, used a vehicle and a knife in the attack. This incident occurs amid data showing a significant increase in antisemitic events in both the U.K. and the U.S., particularly following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel. Experts cited in the article connect the surge in violence to political rhetoric and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, calling for stronger pushback from political leaders.</p>

          <p>Amazon is under federal investigation by the FAA and NTSB after two of its Prime Air delivery drones crashed into a stationary construction crane in Tolleson, Arizona. The collision caused substantial damage to both MK30 drones, which were returning to a nearby warehouse. The company has temporarily paused its drone service in the area following the incident. This event marks another setback for Amazon's long-standing goal of implementing widespread 30-minute drone deliveries, following previous crashes at a test site in Oregon that also prompted federal probes earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Two Delta Connection planes, operated by Endeavor Air, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when the wing of a departing aircraft struck the fuselage and windscreen of an arriving plane. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was transported to a hospital, but no passengers were seriously harmed. The FAA stated that one of the planes was instructed to hold its position and yield to the other.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing widespread disruption, with hundreds of thousands of federal employees either furloughed or working without pay. While essential personnel like border agents and TSA screeners remain on the job, many agencies, including the EPA and the Department of Education, have furloughed a large majority of their staff. The public will experience the effects through paused services and closures, although entities like the Postal Service and Veterans Health Administration are largely unaffected. A 2019 law ensures that all federal employees will eventually receive back pay once the shutdown ends.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally determined that the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, designating them as "unlawful combatants" and "non-state armed groups." This escalation, detailed in a memo to Congress, follows recent U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea that killed 17 people. The memo justifies the strikes as self-defense and frames them as part of a sustained conflict against cartels engaged in drug smuggling.

          <p>A recent decline in mortgage rates has provided financial relief for homebuyers, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.34% from 6.93% in January. For a $700,000 loan, this drop translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, which is about $273 less per month compared to the start of the year. Over the full 30-year term, this lower rate could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest payments. The article also explores refinancing options for current homeowners, cautioning them to consider closing costs, which can range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has shown that artificial intelligence can be used to create DNA codes for toxic proteins that bypass existing biosecurity measures at biotech companies. Researchers used an AI program to generate over 75,000 variants of hazardous proteins by "paraphrasing" their genetic sequences, which then slipped past screening software designed to flag dangerous orders. While a software fix was quickly developed, it is not yet foolproof, highlighting the escalating challenge of preventing the misuse of powerful biological tools. The study's authors have restricted access to their data and software to mitigate potential risks.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the financial devastation from wildfires has accelerated dramatically, with rising global temperatures being a key driver. Researchers found that 43% of the 200 most costly fires on record occurred in the last decade alone, with global losses from 2015 to 2024 totaling $136 billion. The analysis showed that the most destructive blazes were fueled by long-term drought combined with the hottest and driest weather conditions ever recorded. These escalating costs are straining insurance systems and increasing living expenses, highlighting the severe economic consequences of climate change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though its stock dipped following the report. The rise in U.S. sales was partly driven by buyers rushing to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit that expired at the end of the quarter. However, the company faced a sales slump in Europe due to increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric. Year-to-date, Tesla's deliveries are down about 6% compared to the first three quarters of the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French authorities have charged the captain of the oil tanker Boracay, believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent sanctions. The Chinese national faces a charge of refusing to comply with naval orders after French soldiers boarded the vessel, which was on an EU sanctions list for carrying Russian oil. The tanker, which has changed its name and flag multiple times, was detained off the coast of France. This fleet of hundreds of tankers allows Moscow to obscure the ownership and movement of its oil exports in response to Western sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has retorted against U.S. President Donald Trump's recent characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger," warning that Moscow will respond swiftly to any perceived provocation from Europe. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group, Putin claimed his forces are advancing in Ukraine while fighting against nearly the entire NATO alliance. He dismissed concerns about a potential Russian attack on a NATO member as "impossible to believe" and told the alliance to "cool down" and focus on its own domestic problems.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle sales for the third quarter, a rebound largely attributed to a rush of U.S. buyers capitalizing on a $7,500 federal tax credit before it expired. This marks the company's first quarterly sales increase after two consecutive declines. Despite the positive sales figures, the company still faces challenges, including market saturation in California and brand damage from CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting the sales boost may be a temporary "sugar rush" rather than a sign of a sustained structural turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent polling suggests that President Trump's support among Latino voters, a key demographic in his 2024 victory, may be eroding primarily due to economic issues like high grocery and housing costs. A New York Times/Sienna poll found that 69% of Hispanic respondents disapprove of Trump's job performance. While Latino voters consistently rank the economy as their top concern, the polling also indicates that Democrats have not yet made significant gains with this group. As the 2026 midterm elections approach, both parties face the challenge of addressing the economic anxieties of this crucial voting bloc.</p>

          <p>White House budget director Russ Vought has become a central and controversial figure in the current government shutdown, which he and President Trump are framing as an opportunity to permanently cut federal programs. A key architect of the right-wing Project 2025 blueprint, Vought has already moved to cancel billions in funding for green energy projects and freeze infrastructure funds for New York. His actions align with his long-stated goal of restoring the executive branch's "power of the purse" and eliminating spending he deems wasteful, though some Republicans worry his aggressive tactics could backfire politically.</p>

Occidental Petroleum, in which Berkshire already holds a 28.2% stake, plans to use $6.5 billion from the sale to pay down debt, a move its CEO says will enable the company to restart its stock buyback program.

          <p>During a U.S. government shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive their paychecks, unlike hundreds of thousands of federal employees who are furloughed or work without pay. This is because congressional salaries are funded by a permanent appropriation under federal law and are protected by the Constitution, meaning they do not require annual renewal. While lawmakers' pay is secure, their staffers are not paid until the shutdown ends, though most are deemed essential and continue working. The President's salary is also constitutionally protected and is not affected by a lapse in government funding.</p>
