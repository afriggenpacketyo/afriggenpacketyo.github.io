          <p>A husband and wife from Middletown, Rhode Island, were killed when their single-engine plane crashed on Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The aircraft, which had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport, came down on the highway median and burst into flames during a nor'easter storm. A woman driving on the highway was also injured by debris from the aircraft, but her injuries are not considered life-threatening. The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the cause of the crash, with poor weather being considered a potential contributing factor.</p>

          <p>European politicians are grappling with a chaotic and unpredictable global order, described by some as a "three-body problem" involving the United States, China, and Russia. This term, borrowed from a Chinese science fiction novel, reflects the instability of a system with three major competing powers. The U.S. is seen as dismantling the global order it created, while China leverages its economic power and Russia wages war on Europe's border. This complex dynamic is forcing European leaders to search for a new strategic trajectory in a world where old alliances and rules no longer seem to apply.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-14, fueled by a standout performance from running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed for a career-high 170 yards. Robinson's 81-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, the longest in the NFL this season, was a pivotal moment in the game. Despite a comeback attempt by Bills quarterback Josh Allen, the Falcons' defense held strong, securing the win with a late interception. The loss marks the second consecutive defeat for the Bills, raising questions about the strength of their 4-2 record.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a Netherlands-based semiconductor firm owned by Chinese company Wingtech, causing Wingtech's shares to plummet. The move was made under the "Goods Availability Act" to prevent critical goods produced by Nexperia from becoming unavailable in an emergency, highlighting European efforts to secure vital technology supply chains. Nexperia is a major producer of essential chips for the automotive and consumer electronics industries. This action reflects growing geopolitical tensions in the global semiconductor market and has significant implications for international trade and tech security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new hands-free driving law, making it one of 32 states to ban holding cellphones while driving. The legislation was championed by advocates like Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. To better enforce the law and target problem areas, the state's Department of Transportation is using anonymized data from smartphones and vehicles to identify distracted driving hot spots. This data-driven approach aims to reduce the number of accidents, as officials believe distracted driving contributes to nearly one in three fatal crashes.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Petros Krommidas, a 29-year-old candidate for the Nassau County legislature who disappeared after a night swim in the spring, must remain on the ballot. Because he is officially considered a missing person and not legally deceased, Democrats were blocked from naming a replacement. This creates a strange electoral choice for voters, who can either re-elect the Republican incumbent or vote for the missing Democratic candidate. Supporters of Krommidas are urging voters to choose him to honor his memory and potentially trigger a special election where a new candidate could run.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to significantly increase the pay for incarcerated individuals who volunteer to fight California's wildfires. The new law raises their hourly wage from approximately $1 to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. These prison fire crews perform dangerous and physically demanding work, such as clearing brush and digging containment lines, and are a crucial part of the state's wildfire response. The pay raise addresses a long-standing social justice issue concerning the low compensation for this hazardous labor, though the wage remains well below California's statewide minimum.</p>

          <p>Following the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the Gaza peace plan now enters a more challenging phase with significant hurdles remaining. Key unresolved issues include Israel's demand for Hamas to completely disarm, which the group has rejected, and the establishment of a post-war governance structure for Gaza. The U.S.-brokered plan proposes an international body to oversee Palestinian technocrats, but this has not been agreed upon by either side. The fragility of the ceasefire is underscored by these deep-seated disagreements, and negotiations on these complex topics could easily break down, potentially leading to renewed conflict.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to create a commission to study inequalities in youth sports access across California. The commission will examine barriers related to race, gender identity, disability, income, and location. The legislation drew criticism from some Republicans who argued its focus on "gender identity" was a veiled attempt to promote the inclusion of transgender athletes in girls' sports. This move comes after Newsom himself had previously commented on the issue, calling the participation of transgender women in women's sports "deeply unfair," highlighting the complex and contentious nature of the topic.</p>

The protests over the past two years have significantly shifted public discourse but have also led to increased campus tensions, crackdowns on demonstrations, and a surge in antisemitism allegations.

The recommendation is part of a broader strategy of "resilience engineering," which focuses on a company's ability to absorb, recover from, and adapt to attacks, rather than solely relying on prevention.

The NAO cited an under-skilled workforce, corner-cutting by businesses, and weak oversight as key reasons for the failures.
