        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance for cities to address homeless encampments and announced new funding for treatment and housing, emphasizing that there are "no more excuses" for inaction. Newsom called on cities and counties to do their part in addressing encampments, asserting the state is providing ample resources to support these efforts. The model ordinance prioritizes shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments, with Newsom stating there is "nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets." This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new funding, reflecting Newsom's focus on homelessness as he nears the end of his term.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, have dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Officials reviewed dashboard camera footage and determined the officer stopped the wrong vehicle, expressing regret over the mistake. Despite the dismissal, Arias Cristobal remains in ICE custody facing deportation, alongside her father who was also detained following a traffic stop. Her lawyers stated she will likely remain in ICE custody due to her unauthorized status in the U.S. and has a bond hearing scheduled for next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent auction at Christie's in New York revealed potential instability in the art market, as bidding on the Riggio family collection, built on the Barnes & Noble fortune, proved underwhelming. The auction house had guaranteed a minimum amount for the collection and worked to secure pre-sale bids, but the sale fell short of expectations despite a $272 million total. Experts attributed the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty linked to President Trump's tariffs, impacting the global art market. While some works by artists like Gerhard Richter and Vincent van Gogh sold well, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted concerns about the Warhol market's strength.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, impacting over 8,000 individuals who were granted work permits and deportation reprieve due to unsafe conditions in their home country. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that Afghanistan has an improved security situation and a stabilizing economy, allowing for the return of its citizens. This decision has drawn criticism from advocacy groups who argue the move is unconscionable given the ongoing humanitarian crisis since the Taliban's takeover in 2021. The Trump administration has also sought to roll back TPS for Venezuela, but a judge halted that move.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic led to significant flight delays, some lasting up to seven hours. The FAA stated that at least three controllers were scheduled each hour, but sources indicated that only one or two fully certified controllers were on duty during peak times. These delays are the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including recent radar outages caused by software and hardware problems. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for mishandling the relocation of air traffic control from Long Island to Philadelphia, while United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby reassured customers about flight safety.</p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee (DNC) panel has recommended redoing David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta's elections to party vice-chair, citing violations of the party's charter during the February election. The resolution, passed by the DNC's credentials committee, stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg in one of the vice chair races. Free alleges the DNC improperly combined two questions and tallied votes together, giving male candidates an advantage over female candidates. Hogg has faced pushback over his efforts to mount primary challenges against Democrats, leading to controversy within the party.</p>

          <p>Professor Ralph Keeling warns that proposed cuts by the Trump administration could eliminate funding for NOAA's global CO2 program, ending decades of critical scientific research. The program, started by Keeling's father, monitors CO2 levels in the atmosphere, providing crucial data on climate change. Keeling argues that ending the program would degrade the nation's ability to project future climate impacts, comparing it to "turning off the headlights on a dark street at night." The NOAA program collects air samples from around the world, contributing to the Keeling Curve, a graph plotting the rise of carbon dioxide.</p>

While gold is often seen as a safe haven asset, experts caution that it is not immune to price fluctuations and major surges have been followed by significant falls. Central banks have been net buyers of gold, seeking independence from dollar-based banking systems, and some believe that fear of missing out (FOMO) is also driving demand. Experts offer mixed opinions, with some forecasting continued upward trends and others warning of a potential market bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

Jordan expressed excitement about returning to NBC, where he experienced significant moments in his career, and fans have shown enthusiasm for his move to commentating. During his 15 seasons in the NBA, Jordan won six championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named Finals MVP in all six championships. NBC first broadcast NBA games from 1954 to 1962 and again from 1990 to 2002, and the network struck a deal to broadcast NBA and WNBA games for the next 11 years.</p>

          <p>The primary goal of prescribing GLP-1 drugs should be changes in health, not just weight, as these medications can reduce visceral fat, which is linked to metabolic diseases. Visceral fat, accumulating around the waist, can lead to inflammation and organ dysfunction, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. While GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat, doctors need better ways to identify patients who would benefit most from them, as BMI has limited utility as a health metric. The article suggests that the focus should be on identifying and treating excess visceral fat to save lives and improve overall health.</p>
