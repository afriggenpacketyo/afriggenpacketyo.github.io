        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of twenty states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The suit alleges this action violates privacy protections and creates a climate of fear, potentially discouraging immigrants from seeking necessary medical care. Federal officials defend the data sharing as a legal effort to combat fraud and ensure federal funds are not used for non-citizens. The lawsuit seeks to halt the data transfer and prevent its use in immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" tobacco use. Violators of the new law face significant fines, ranging from 135 to 700 euros. The government aims to combat the high rate of tobacco-related deaths, which claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. While smoking has been illegal in restaurants and bars since 2008, over 30% of French adults still smoke, prompting these stricter measures, though cafÃ© terraces remain a notable exception.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, a proposal mediated by Qatar and Egypt. He urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating that the terms would not improve and that the situation would only worsen otherwise. This development comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

          <p>While the U.S. pushes for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a significant humanitarian controversy is unfolding in Gaza. Over 170 NGOs are calling for the dismantlement of the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) for aid distribution, citing hundreds of civilian deaths near its sites. These aid groups argue the GHF system is unsafe and forces Palestinians to risk their lives for food. This occurs as Israel reviews an airstrike on a Gaza cafe that killed 24 people, and reports emerge of more Palestinians killed while trying to reach aid.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law against PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," found in many consumer products and linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out nonessential PFAS products by 2032. 3M, the company that developed and manufactured PFAS, has agreed to stop production and pay $850 million for state cleanup efforts, though no definitive link was proven between PFAS and Strande's illness.</p>

          <p>A new study in The Lancet medical journal projects that the Trump administration's shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The research analyzed two decades of data, concluding that USAID funding was associated with saving over 90 million lives, particularly by reducing mortality from HIV/AIDS and malaria. The administration argues the agency has been inefficient, while the study's authors contend that for a small taxpayer cost, USAID has had a substantial life-saving impact globally.</p>

Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to Chicago, where he will formally change his plea in July. His capture and extradition have been part of a larger, violent power struggle within the cartel.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team is facing a difficult period after suffering two decisive T20 losses to India, who now lead the series 2-0.

          <p>The UK is facing growing drought concerns after one of its driest springs on record, with northwest England and Yorkshire already in an official drought. Low rainfall has led to significantly below-normal river flows and exceptionally low reservoir levels, particularly in northern England. While western regions received some rain in June, central and eastern areas remained dry, increasing the risk of water shortages. The conditions are already impacting farmers, who face higher irrigation costs, and wildlife, as habitats and food sources dry up.</p>

Nvidia overcame early-year concerns to rally hard due to its continued dominance in the AI chip market.

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it may investigate the U.S. citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor. This follows a call from a Republican congressman to revoke Mamdani's citizenship, alleging he may have concealed support for terrorism during his naturalization process. President Trump also threatened to have Mamdani arrested over his pro-immigrant stances. Mamdani, who became a citizen in 2018, called the threats an authoritarian attack on democracy and an attempt to intimidate critics of the administration's policies.</p>

          <h2>Senate Republicans Overcome Internal Objections to Pass Trump's Sweeping Policy Bill</h2>

          <p>After intense last-minute deal-making, Senate Republicans successfully passed President Trump's top legislative priority, a massive policy bill that includes tax cut extensions and funding for mass deportations. Leadership managed to placate key holdouts like Senators Josh Hawley and Lisa Murkowski by adding provisions for rural hospitals and benefits for Alaska, securing a 51-50 victory with the Vice President breaking the tie. The bill, which critics say will increase the deficit and cut essential services like Medicaid, now moves to the House for an urgent vote.</p>

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has reached verdicts on four counts related to sex trafficking and prostitution but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. Deliberations will continue on the RICO charge, which alleges Combs ran his Bad Boy Entertainment empire as a criminal enterprise. The trial featured graphic testimony from three women, including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who described a pattern of physical abuse, coercion, and forced sexual encounters. The partial verdicts mark a critical moment in the high-profile case.</p>
