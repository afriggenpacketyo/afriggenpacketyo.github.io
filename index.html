          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after the team instructed his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass, citing fairness after a slow pit stop had reversed their on-track positions. The decision sparked debate, as Piastri initially questioned the call but ultimately complied, cutting his championship lead over Norris to 31 points. This incident highlights the growing tension and complex team dynamics as the two drivers contend for the Formula 1 title.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's focus on international affairs is contrasted with significant domestic turmoil, as his government faces a potential collapse over a national debt crisis. Prime Minister François Bayrou has proposed an unpopular austerity plan to reduce the fiscal deficit, leading to a scheduled no-confidence vote and threats of union strikes. While the vote is expected to oust Bayrou, analysts believe Macron will likely appoint a new prime minister and pass a more moderate budget rather than call a snap election. The political instability has caused some concern in European financial markets.</p>

          <p>In what Ukraine's air force described as a record aerial assault, Russia launched over 800 drones and missiles across the country, striking Ukraine's main government building in Kyiv for the first time. The attack damaged the building's roof and upper floors, representing a significant symbolic escalation in the conflict. At least four people were killed in strikes nationwide, including a mother and baby in a residential building in Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the "ruthless attack" and called for greater international political will to stop the violence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new immigration enforcement operation in Boston while continuing to threaten a similar, large-scale crackdown in Chicago. President Trump recently shared a provocative, AI-generated image likening a potential Chicago operation to the film "Apocalypse Now," drawing sharp criticism from Mayor Brandon Johnson. Despite data showing lower crime rates in Chicago compared to some cities in red states, Trump has defended his focus on the city. This follows his executive order to rename the Department of Defense the "Department of War," signaling an aggressive domestic enforcement posture.</p>

          <p>Kansas Senator Roger Marshall defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial changes to U.S. vaccine policy, stating Kennedy was appointed to be a "disrupter" to the CDC. In an interview, Marshall argued that not every person needs every vaccine and that parents and doctors should be empowered to make individual decisions, creating a distinction between the needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and now. He faced questions about undermining public trust in institutions like the CDC and creating barriers to vaccine access, but maintained that his approach is based on common sense and individual medical needs.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions, including Unison, are warning the Labour government against watering down its proposed Employment Rights Bill following a recent cabinet reshuffle that saw key proponents of the legislation moved. Union leaders fear that the government may be losing its commitment to the bill, which promises a significant overhaul of workers' rights, including a ban on zero-hours contracts and enhanced protection against unfair dismissal. The concerns are amplified by business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses, which see the reshuffle as an opportunity to "fix the issues" they have with the proposed changes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently hosted the first event in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, dubbed the "Rose Garden Club," for Republican members of Congress. The unveiling of the space, which features a new patio-like design, quickly became a subject of online mockery. Social media users and critics compared the new look to the patio of a Cheesecake Factory or an Au Bon Pain, with some expressing a desire to see it restored to its previous state. The event itself included dinner, speeches, and autographs, but the focus of public commentary was largely on the aesthetic changes.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes the Trump administration for transforming the metaphorical "war on drugs" into a literal military campaign, citing a recent strike that killed 11 alleged traffickers from Venezuela. The article argues this policy sets a dangerous precedent for extrajudicial military action without congressional approval, drawing parallels to the expanded executive power seen during the "war on terror." The piece contends that such actions are not only morally wrong and likely to kill innocents but are also counterproductive, potentially hampering international cooperation needed to combat drug cartels effectively.</p>

The win serves as revenge for New Zealand after a defeat to Ireland in the WXV1 tournament last year.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren-like sound on Sunday afternoon as the government conducted its second national test of the emergency alert system. The test, which sent a message and vibration for about 10 seconds, was designed to ensure the system's effectiveness in warning the public about life-threatening events like severe weather or public safety emergencies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the test a success and an important step for national safety. The system has already been used in five real emergencies on a regional basis.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has officially canonized Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, making him the first millennial to be declared a saint. Acutis, an amateur computer programmer born in London, was known for his deep faith and for using the internet to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization followed the Vatican's recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession. His life is presented as a modern model of holiness for young people around the world.</p>

The alleged shooter was arrested and charged under a local county ordinance, as South Carolina is one of only two U.S. states without a statewide hate crime law. A proposed bill that would add enhanced penalties for such crimes has passed the state House but has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>

          <p>The advancement of Artificial Intelligence is raising concerns that it will not only automate tasks but also fundamentally break the traditional career ladder by eliminating many entry-level jobs. As companies adopt AI and flatten their organizational structures, opportunities for new graduates are shrinking, with one study showing a 50% decline in such roles at tech firms since 2019. This trend challenges the classic narrative of rising from a junior position to leadership. Experts suggest the nature of entry-level work will evolve, requiring new graduates to develop advanced AI-related skills independently before entering the workforce.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that while the end of the "de minimis" tariff exemption will affect some small businesses, the resulting panic is misdirected. The author contends that the vast majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly impacted by this specific change. The article suggests the larger concern should be overall economic health, such as employment and consumer spending power, which currently remain strong enough to absorb the price increases caused by tariffs. Businesses are advised to adapt by diversifying suppliers and offering flexible payment options rather than panicking over policy details.</p>

The 12-hour journey is believed to be the world's longest in such a vessel, aimed at promoting fungal materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation. The unique, bumpy kayak was cultivated on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold. Shoemaker hopes his achievement will inspire further innovation in sustainable, mycelium-based technologies.</p>

          <p>The number of arrests at a London protest against the UK's ban on the group Palestine Action has climbed to 890, according to the Metropolitan Police. The majority were arrested for supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act, after the government banned the group in July. Police reported that the protest turned violent, resulting in 17 arrests for assaults on officers. However, organizers from Defend Our Juries dispute this, claiming protesters were peacefully defying the ban and that the police response was disproportionately violent and intended to overwhelm the justice system.</p>
