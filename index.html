As the only U.S. company capable of making the most advanced chips domestically, this move aligns with the administration's goal of increasing high-tech production in the United States. The potential government investment would help fund Intel's new factories in Ohio, a project that has faced recent slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

The move, which would require a special election and a constitutional amendment, aims to create five new Democratic-leaning seats to offset potential GOP gains in Texas. This escalates a national political battle over redistricting that could significantly influence control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

Smotrich stated the construction would "bury the idea of a Palestinian state," drawing condemnation from the US, UK, EU, and UN.</p>

Upcoming data releases and the Fed's September meeting are seen as critical dates that could influence whether rates will continue their downward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Glasgow schoolgirl, Rebecca Young, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for inventing a solar-powered blanket to help homeless people stay warm. She designed the device at age 12, and it was later turned into a working prototype by an engineering firm, with dozens distributed to a local homeless charity. For her inspiring invention, Rebecca was honored by Time and its partner Lego, which created a mini-figure in her likeness.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues Trump's Takeover of D.C. Is a Hypocritical Power Grab Based on Falsehoods</h2>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Rebecca Solnit condemns President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C. as an act of staggering hypocrisy and an authoritarian power grab. She argues that the justification for the move—rising crime—is a lie, as data shows violent crime is at a 30-year low, contrasting it with the violence of the January 6th insurrection instigated by Trump. Solnit frames the action as part of a broader right-wing war on diverse, Democratic-led cities, using manufactured crises to impose control.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has taken federal control of Washington D.C.'s police, legal experts suggest it would be far more difficult to do so in other cities like Los Angeles or Chicago. D.C.'s unique status as a federal district gives the president direct authority that does not extend to states, where governors command their own National Guard units. Any attempt to deploy federal troops for domestic law enforcement in a state would face significant legal challenges under the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, one of the last traditional grocery markets in L.A.'s Chinatown, is closing after 18 years, succumbing to a combination of pressures including gentrification, crime, and the pandemic's lingering effects. Owner Amy Tran provided affordable, fresh produce to the neighborhood's elderly and low-income residents, but declining foot traffic and a series of robberies made the business unsustainable. The closure represents the loss of a vital community hub in a historic enclave that has seen its cultural identity diminish.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has threatened to sue Hunter Biden for more than $1 billion if he does not retract a claim that she was introduced to Donald Trump by the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers called the statement, made by Biden during an interview, "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory," causing significant reputational harm. Biden has defended his comments and appears unwilling to apologize, stating that a lawsuit would provide a platform to depose both of the Trumps.</p>
