        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties as the island nation has recently pivoted towards China. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on an anti-India platform, has since softened his rhetoric, calling India a "most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, highlighting the strategic importance of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The move is seen as an effort to counteract China's growing influence in the strategically vital region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's cricket team is uncertain if captain Ben Stokes will be able to bowl on the final day of the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford. Stokes, who has a history of injuries, experienced stiffness and soreness after taking five wickets in the first innings and did not bowl on day four. His potential absence is a significant concern for England as they push for a victory, especially after he was seen holding his hamstring. India ended the day at 174-2, still trailing by 137 runs, with hopes of batting for a draw to keep the series lead.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:26:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields returned to the practice field, alleviating fears of a serious injury after he was carted off with a dislocated toe earlier in the week. While he participated in 7-on-7 drills, he was held out of full team drills as the coaching staff eases him back into action. Head coach Aaron Glenn stated that the initial social media panic was unwarranted and that he does not anticipate the injury will derail Fields' season. The incident had initially caused widespread concern among fans, reminiscent of former quarterback Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury last year.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Speaking ahead of the Euro 2025 final, Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape of women's football made it a good time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female footballers. Chadha is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer, which recently faced a public relations crisis. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert, with the footage going viral. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a video deftly avoiding the scandal while promoting the company's data workflow automation services. The move is an attempt by Astronomer to steer the narrative away from the controversy and back towards its core business.</p>

Israel's military stated it fired warning shots at the aid site in response to a threat and was unaware of casualties. The international community is increasing pressure on Israel to alleviate the humanitarian crisis as aid delivery remains severely restricted and insufficient.</p>

          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence to support claims of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. This finding contradicts repeated assertions by the Trump administration, which has used such claims to justify its support for a new aid distribution system and Israeli restrictions. The report, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations, noted that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified. The State Department and the Israeli Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back against the report's conclusions.</p>

Gyokeres has been a prolific scorer in Portugal, with 97 goals in 102 matches for Sporting. The acquisition is a major move for Arsenal, bringing their summer spending to approximately £204 million as they look to strengthen their squad with a clinical, powerful forward.</p>

          <p>In this analysis, BBC's Jeremy Bowen argues that Israel's offer to allow airdrops of aid into Gaza is a crude, desperate measure that will not solve the region's hunger crisis. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts, he describes airdrops as inefficient, dangerous, and a last resort used when all other access is impossible, which is not the case for Gaza. He points out that planes carry far less than truck convoys and that pallets can land inaccurately, potentially causing harm and sparking fights among desperate civilians. The article concludes that only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term ground operation can truly address the starvation.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot mega-prison are now being repatriated and sharing accounts of horrific abuse. Lawyers for the men describe their experience as "state-sanctioned torture," with detainees reporting lengthy beatings, humiliation by guards, being shot with rubber bullets, and unsanitary living conditions. The men, some of whom were flagged as potential gang members without conviction, were sent to the prison as part of a U.S. policy. Their release was secured through a prisoner swap deal between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, and their testimonies provide a first-hand look into the brutal conditions inside the controversial facility.</p>

According to internal documents, the "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting 50% of them within a year. The initiative is part of President Trump's campaign promise for the "most aggressive regulatory reduction" in history. While the White House states all options are being explored and no single plan is final, some federal employees have confirmed AI was recently used to review thousands of regulatory lines.</p>

While Netflix's recent earnings were strong, Rogers argues that engagement is the key driver of the business model, and any lag could be worrisome.

          <p>An international research team has discovered that certain sequences of "junk" DNA, previously thought to be non-functional, actually play a significant role in regulating gene expression. The study focused on a family of "jumping genes" called MER11, which originated from an ancient retrovirus and make up a substantial portion of the human genome. Researchers found that the youngest of these sequences can act like genetic switches, attracting proteins that turn genes on and off without altering the underlying DNA. This finding challenges the "junk" label and suggests these elements have evolved to become crucial components of our genetic machinery.</p>

          <p>A panel of political journalists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" analyzed why Donald Trump has been unable to deflect public attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Panelists argued the issue strikes at the core of Trump's "MAGA base" narrative, which often targets powerful elites conducting secret dealings. By appearing to defend or downplay the situation, Trump is now being perceived by some of his own base as one of the powerful people he has long criticized. This dynamic, they suggest, is a key reason the controversy continues to spiral and has become a significant political liability for the president.</p>

However, legal experts interviewed for the article suggest that grand jury transcripts may not reveal much about Epstein's network of abusers or enablers.
