          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of cooking a mushroom lunch that led to three deaths and one hospitalization, testified that she wanted the meal to be "special" for her guests. The victims, Patterson's in-laws and Gail's sister, fell ill and died after the lunch in July 2023, while Gail's husband recovered after being in a coma. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder, claiming the incident was a tragic accident. She admitted to misleading her guests about needing cancer treatment and disposing of a food dehydrator out of fear of being blamed, but denied intentionally poisoning them, stating she loved them like family. The trial is expected to continue for at least two more weeks.</p>

          <p>A recent Ipsos poll indicates a growing sense of societal breakdown across major European economies, with many believing their countries are in decline. Negative sentiment has increased significantly in Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy over the past four years. Economic concerns, such as the perception that economies are rigged to favor the wealthy, contribute to this populism. Britons are most inclined to support a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to address these issues, while limited fiscal space restricts the government's ability to implement popularity-boosting spending measures. This poll suggests that populism is continuing to be a potent force in the European political landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's second travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has been met with less immediate chaos compared to his initial 2017 ban. This is attributed to the administration's ongoing implementation of numerous immigration restrictions, creating a state of "death by 1,000 cuts." While the new ban includes exemptions, it is expected to face legal challenges and will likely separate families and disproportionately affect those seeking refuge. Experts suggest the ban is more likely to withstand legal scrutiny than the first, but it normalizes restrictions on immigration, impacting families still recovering from previous policies.</p>

MSC's senior vice-president stated that the port fee would not deter them from ordering more ships from China, emphasizing the country's competence and capacity.

          <p>This guest essay reflects on the victory of a horse named Journalism at the Preakness Stakes, highlighting the importance of patience and strategic timing. Journalism, initially boxed in and fading, demonstrated resilience by waiting for an opportunity to surge through a narrow opening in the final stretch. The horse's ability to overcome obstacles and make up significant ground in the last moments secured a win, serving as a reminder that victories are sometimes earned through calculated patience rather than immediate speed. Journalism is now set to compete in the Belmont Stakes, which is shorter than usual due to renovations at Belmont Park.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are standing firm against Elon Musk's criticism of President Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill,' despite Musk's influence and call to "Kill the Bill." House Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to contact Musk to address his concerns, but Musk instead posted a "Kill Bill" meme on X, expressing his opposition to the legislation. While some Republicans acknowledge Musk's influence, they insist there is no time for a new bill. Democrats view Musk's opposition as an opportunity to derail the legislation, but some question their consistency in supporting Musk. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $2.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, but Republicans dispute this figure.</p>

          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, despite economists' median estimates of 5.75%. The decision follows a better-than-expected GDP growth figure in the fiscal fourth quarter, with the economy expanding 7.4% year-on-year. The RBI has maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, and this decision comes amid concerns about growth and a downtrend in inflation, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%.</p>

While the party isn't reliant on his money, his heritage helped temper criticisms of racism. Yusuf's departure highlights the challenge of building a stable and expert team to transform Reform UK into an election-winning machine.

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 decision. The trial focused on whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable after a 2008 estimate of a potential 15.7-meter tsunami. The presiding judge stated the government's assessment did not provide sufficient grounds for immediate construction work, prompting criticism from the shareholders' lawyer, who intends to appeal.</p>

A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight, assessing their robustness against vibration and radiation. The test aims to transition from experimental validation to a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD), offering a more efficient and potentially more secure method of communication by skipping the key-sharing step.</p>
