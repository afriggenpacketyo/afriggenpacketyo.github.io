        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, hesitated to commit to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which ensures collective defense among member states, stating that the definition of the agreement has multiple interpretations. While acknowledging friendship with NATO leaders and a commitment to helping them, he deferred providing a precise definition until his arrival at the summit. This ambiguity has raised concerns among allied nations regarding the U.S.'s dedication to mutual defense, a cornerstone of the alliance's security framework. Trump emphasized his focus on saving lives and ensuring safety, promising a clearer explanation upon reaching the summit, yet his initial reluctance has stirred unease among NATO partners. The situation reflects uncertainty. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an early U.S. intelligence assessment, the military strikes ordered by President Trump on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back the program by a few months, contradicting claims of complete obliteration. The report, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Central Command, suggests that while significant damage was inflicted on above-ground structures, enriched uranium remained intact, and centrifuges were largely unaffected. This assessment contrasts sharply with statements from Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth, who insisted the program had been "completely demolished." White House officials have disputed the intelligence findings, alleging that the leak to CNN was an attempt to undermine the President and discredit the military mission. The disagreement reflects conflicting perspectives on the effectiveness of the strikes. </p>

Net income saw a substantial increase to $565 million, up from $92 million the previous year. CEO Josh Weinstein highlighted the strong momentum across all of Carnival's brands, leading to an increased forecast for adjusted net income, now expected to be 40% higher than 2024, and adjusted EBITDA projected at $6.9 billion. The company is also preparing for the opening of Celebration Key in the Bahamas, which is expected to further boost demand. </p>

          <p>Two four-year-old bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and raided the food store, consuming a week's supply of honey before falling asleep. The wildlife park reported that the bears posed no threat to the public, though visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure, and police were called to the scene while an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the escape. The park attributed the incident to an "operational error" and assured the public that measures would be taken to prevent future occurrences. </p>

          <p>A 55-year-old hiker from Texas was rescued from Mount Washington in New Hampshire after suffering from hypothermia, highlighting the stark contrast between the East Coast heat wave and the mountain's frigid conditions. The hiker, Caroline Wilson, was found unresponsive on the Gulfside Trail, prompting a rescue operation involving conservation officers and volunteers. Despite cities experiencing sweltering heat, the summit of Mount Washington saw temperatures around 20 degrees Fahrenheit with high winds and dense cloud cover. Wilson's condition was exacerbated by wearing cotton base layers, which are not ideal for hiking due to their absorbent nature. The rescue team successfully stabilized and transported her to a local hospital, underscoring the unpredictable and potentially life-threatening conditions in the White Mountains. </p>

Approximately 5.8 million borrowers were 90 days or more past due on their payments as of April 2025, representing 31% of borrowers with payments due, a significant increase from pre-pandemic levels. Based on current trends, about 1.8 million borrowers could face default status in July, potentially leading to wage garnishment and other collection actions.

The club, burdened with significant debt, had attempted to improve its financial situation through player sales and the release of high earners.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly holding a record 59,000 detainees, with nearly half lacking a criminal record, according to internal government data. This figure represents over 140% of the agency's allocated detention capacity, indicating a significant expansion of immigration arrests under the Trump administration. ICE's daily arrest rate has nearly doubled compared to the beginning of Trump's second administration, driven by interior arrests rather than border crossings. The administration has also broadened the scope of who is subject to detention, reversing previous policies that focused on serious criminals and recent arrivals. This expansion has raised concerns about detention conditions and due process for immigrants. </p>

          <p>President Trump urged Congress to remain in session and pass his "big, beautiful bill" before taking a vacation. He called on senators to finalize the deal and for the House to immediately pass it. Trump's demand comes as the bill faces challenges in the Senate due to policy disagreements among Republicans. The bill's fate remains uncertain as it awaits Senate approval and potential revisions that could affect its acceptance by the House. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Jordin Alexander Melgar-Salmeron, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. Melgar-Salmeron was deported minutes after a court order barred his removal, marking the fourth known case of a migrant being ordered back after wrongful deportation. The court found Melgar-Salmeron's deportation "improper" and ordered his return to ensure his case is handled as if he had not been wrongly removed. The administration must provide details on Melgar-Salmeron's current location and the steps it will take to facilitate his return. </p>

          <p>China closely monitors the conflict between Israel and Iran due to its status as the largest importer of Iranian oil and a political partner of Tehran. Iran exports approximately 90% of its crude oil to China, despite U.S. sanctions, which China purchases at a discounted rate. This trade relationship has fostered a close partnership between the two countries, with China evacuating thousands of its citizens from Iran following recent strikes. China's reliance on Iranian oil and its political ties contribute to its vested interest in the region's stability. </p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has faulted Boeing for a lack of safety protocols that contributed to a midair blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet.

The NTSB emphasized that Boeing relied on a single point of failure, with inadequately trained workers performing critical tasks. While Boeing and the FAA have since improved safety processes, the incident has raised significant concerns about quality control at the aerospace manufacturer. </p>

With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, the CD offers a guaranteed return, making it a more attractive option for savers seeking stability.
