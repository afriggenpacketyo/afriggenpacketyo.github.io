          <p>A Chinese academic, Wang Shuguo, argues that China's doctoral education system, with its overemphasis on published papers, stifles talent and hinders innovation. He points to DeepSeek, an AI start-up founded by Liang Wenfeng, who did not pursue a PhD, as an example of innovation occurring outside university laboratories. Wang suggests that China's technological breakthroughs are being driven by companies whose owners lack PhDs, implying a need for academic reform to foster more innovation. The current system, according to Wang, shackles talent and prevents the emergence of groundbreaking research findings. Optimism for the future of China's academic system is uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to reassure international students, particularly those from China, has added to the confusion surrounding the administration's stance on student visas. Trump stated that foreign students would be "OK," but this followed an announcement that the U.S. would "aggressively revoke" visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The lack of clarity regarding the criteria for visa revocation and the definition of "critical fields" has led to uncertainty and formal protests from Beijing, further straining relations between the two countries. The situation remains unclear, and the future of Chinese students in the U.S. is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall in Mokwa, Nigeria, has caused severe flooding, resulting in at least 151 deaths and displacing over 3,000 people.

President Bola Tinubu has directed the activation of the national emergency response center to provide assistance, and search-and-rescue operations are ongoing.

          <p>A United Way report reveals that 47% of Florida households do not earn enough to cover basic living expenses, despite being above the poverty line. The ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) classification highlights the struggles of families who earn too much for traditional aid but not enough to afford necessities like housing, childcare, food, and healthcare. Senior households are disproportionately affected, with many living paycheck to paycheck and unable to save.

          <p>Due to trade tensions and recession fears, travelers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are scaling back their spending plans, with budgets for their longest trips showing minimal increase from the previous year. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, choosing to stay with family and friends, and driving instead of flying to save money. Despite lower travel costs, inflation is causing people to spend more overall, leaving less disposable income for non-essential items like travel.</p>

          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly increased Strategy's market capitalization, is now being adopted by other companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates. Despite announcements from Trump Media and GameStop regarding bitcoin investments, Wall Street remains skeptical, with shares of both companies declining. Saylor believes that the adoption of bitcoin by corporations marks a global shift in corporate finance and that bitcoin ambassadors are expanding its reach worldwide. The Biden administration previously viewed corporate bitcoin adoption as a regulatory concern, but the Trump administration has taken a different approach, establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and encouraging federal agencies to treat bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have decided to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a warming of relations between the two countries. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing with their Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, who expressed China's willingness to assist in improving Afghanistan-Pakistan relations. Relations between the two neighbors have been strained due to accusations that Kabul harbors Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghans.

The author claims that NPR is biased and that its lawyers are arrogant in arguing that Trump's actions violate the First Amendment. The piece highlights instances where NPR is perceived to favor liberal viewpoints and accuses NPR of being a queen of leaks from Democrats seeking to damage Republican Supreme Court picks. The author argues that NPR's CEO's claim that the organization is nonpartisan is false, citing an investigation that found a significant disparity in the political affiliations of NPR news employees.

          <p>Following a rock fall and glacier collapse in the Swiss LÃ¶tschental valley, the situation has stabilized overnight as accumulated water behind the debris began to flow downstream. Construction machinery has been deployed to control the run-off of water and ensure smooth flow through the villages. Residents remain on alert due to forecast rain, which could lead to further landslides. The village of Blatten, buried by the collapse, will be rebuilt, according to municipal president Matthias Bellwald.</p>

While some Republican proposals have called for raising the U.S. retirement age, experts warn that it may not be a suitable solution due to income inequality and differences in life expectancy. Raising the retirement age is effectively a benefit cut and could disproportionately harm those at the bottom income quartiles. The political feasibility of raising the retirement age in the U.S. remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump is accused of empowering the federal government to reward allies and punish opponents, violating principles of limited government and checks and balances. The article suggests that the Trump administration is a "thugocracy" that has abandoned almost every principle to which Republicans once professed fealty.

The concerns are directed at the draft regulations' potential approval of polluting recycling technologies and the expansive exemption for products and packaging that fall under the purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.
