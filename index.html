          <p>Five jockeys missed their scheduled rides on day three of Glorious Goodwood after their private plane, departing from Bagby Airfield in North Yorkshire, experienced a suspected engine problem and was forced to make an emergency landing. The pilot, with 25 years of experience, skillfully managed to turn the aircraft around and land safely back at Bagby, ensuring all five jockeys, including Rowan Scott and PJ McDonald, were reported to be unharmed despite the frightening ordeal. This unexpected aviation incident necessitated immediate rider replacements for their high-profile races, causing disruption to the prestigious event's lineup.

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after a jury found him guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig. Prosecutors revealed Craig, entangled in an affair and facing financial woes, systematically poisoned his wife's protein shakes with arsenic before delivering a fatal dose of cyanide in the hospital. Despite defense arguments suggesting suicide, the Arapahoe County coroner's findings and compelling evidence, including Craig's online searches for poisons, led to his conviction for first-degree murder. One of the couple's six children delivered a poignant victim impact statement, emphasizing the profound betrayal by their father.</p>

          <p>Ivory Coast's 83-year-old President Alassane Ouattara announced his intention to run for a fourth term, a move enabled by constitutional changes he implemented in 2016 that reset term limits. This decision, despite his previous promises to step down, is justified by his party as a response to security challenges and a unified request from his political base. The opposition views Ouattara's candidacy as a constitutional violation and plans legal challenges, especially after several prominent opposition figures were barred from the upcoming election due to convictions or dual citizenship issues. This development intensifies political polarization, recalling past electoral unrest that resulted in thousands of fatalities.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Alexander Isak is currently training alone at his former club, Real Sociedad, intensifying speculation surrounding his future with the Magpies. The Sweden international was notably absent from Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia, with the club citing a "minor" thigh issue, though sources indicate Isak is exploring a move away. Interest from clubs like Liverpool highlights the potential for a significant transfer for the 25-year-old, who joined Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022 for £60m.

          <p>WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter publicly expressed support for actress Sydney Sweeney amidst a social media backlash concerning her American Eagle advertisement. The campaign, titled "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," sparked controversy, with some critics alleging it promoted thinness and even drew comparisons to "Nazi propaganda." However, Sweeney's defenders, including a Fox News Digital columnist, argued that the criticism stemmed from her appearance and a broader anti-woke sentiment, rather than the ad's content itself. Despite the online furor, American Eagle's share price saw an initial rise, suggesting the controversy did not negatively impact the brand's market standing.</p>

The comprehensive report identified 13 missed opportunities to escalate his care, attributing failures to a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight and disjointed record-keeping across multiple healthcare providers.

          <p>Florida is preparing to execute Edward Zakrzewski, 60, convicted of the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, which would mark the state's ninth death sentence carried out in 2025, setting a new annual record. This execution proceeds despite a jury's 7-5 recommendation for the death penalty, a split vote that would not permit execution under current state law. Zakrzewski's final appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. Opponents, including The Action Network, are protesting the execution, citing his military service and the narrow jury vote, arguing that justice does not necessitate death in this tragic case.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after eight children at a summer camp in Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire, fell ill and were subsequently hospitalized. Fortunately, all affected children have since been discharged, and a police investigation led by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit is underway. Concurrently, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) is examining Leicestershire Police's handling of initial concerns regarding the children's well-being, specifically looking into potential delays in their response. Authorities are actively working to provide reassurance to affected families and continue inquiries into this complex and sensitive case.</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options can utilize their home equity through Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) or home equity loans, which currently offer significantly lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 31, 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.25% to 8.41%, while the average HELOC rate stands at 8.26%, according to Bankrate. Home equity loans provide a fixed-rate lump sum, whereas HELOCs offer a variable-rate revolving credit line. Both products can provide tax benefits for eligible home repairs, but borrowers must carefully consider the risks, as their home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's "baseline tariff" of 10% on all U.S. imports and higher "reciprocal tariffs" are set to take full effect on August 1, as he aims to reshape global trade. While deals have been struck with major partners like the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea, many other countries still face increased levies or ongoing negotiations. These agreements typically involve lower tariffs than initially threatened for goods entering the U.S., alongside commitments for U.S. investments or energy purchases. However, major economies like China, Canada, Mexico, India, and Brazil are still navigating unresolved trade disputes, with some facing escalated tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, accelerated in June, rising 0.3% month-over-month and 2.8% annually, remaining above the Fed's 2% target. This uptick, particularly in core goods prices, is increasingly attributed to the impact of President Trump's tariffs, raising concerns for the central bank regarding persistent inflation. Despite these pressures, the Fed opted to hold interest rates steady at its July meeting, with Chair Jerome Powell indicating it's still "early days" to fully assess the tariff impact. Following this data, markets are now pricing in a higher likelihood of the Fed maintaining current rates at its September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments today on the legality of former President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he imposed using an emergency powers law. The case challenges whether Trump exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement a 10% baseline duty and higher reciprocal tariffs on numerous trading partners. A lower court previously ruled against Trump, but the appeals court temporarily reinstated the tariffs. The outcome of this case, brought by states and small businesses, is seen as a major test for Trump's economic agenda, with implications for U.S. trade policy and the balance of presidential power.

The recognition is explicitly predicated on Palestinian Authority reforms, including demilitarization and excluding Hamas from future governance.
