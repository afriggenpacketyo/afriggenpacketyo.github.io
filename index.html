          <p>More than 25 protesters were arrested after occupying an academic building at the University of Washington, advocating for the school to cut ties with Boeing due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The group, Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return, demanded the building be renamed and all donations from Boeing be ceased. The university stated that the individuals were trespassing and would face legal and student conduct actions. Boeing has a long-standing relationship with the University of Washington, providing approximately $10 million for the construction of the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mike Amesbury, former Runcorn MP, attributes Labour's recent election losses, including losing his former seat to Reform UK, to the government's "big political mistakes" concerning benefit cuts. Amesbury, who resigned after a prison sentence for assaulting a constituent, specifically cited the decision to axe winter fuel payments for pensioners and make it harder to claim personal independence payments (Pips). He emphasized that Reform UK benefited from these missteps, despite his own mistake triggering the by-election. Amesbury hopes Prime Minister Starmer and Chancellor Reeves will listen, learn, and respond to these electoral signals, as other Labour MPs voice opposition to the benefit cuts.</p>

          <p>Egypt and China concluded their first joint military exercises, signaling a growing relationship between the U.S. ally and one of its top rivals. The drills involved joint aerial exercises, simulated air combat, and modern warfare lectures, showcasing China's military capabilities beyond Asia. This development raises concerns for the U.S., as Egypt, a major recipient of U.S. military aid, has also been purchasing military equipment from Russia. Experts suggest that Egypt is diversifying its patrons due to concerns about potential aid cuts from the U.S. and is seeking more stable, long-term partnerships.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate panel is set to consider cases involving two international students from Tufts and Columbia universities who face removal from the U.S. after making statements critical of Israel. The Trump administration revoked the student visas of Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi, leading to their detention by immigration officials. Lower court judges had previously issued orders for Ozturk's transfer to Vermont and Mahdawi's release, but the administration is seeking a stay of these orders. The State Department has reportedly rescinded visas for at least 300 students accused of supporting Palestinians or participating in campus protests.</p>

          <p>The growing political divide between young men and women is explored, suggesting that economic shifts over the past half-century are a key factor. The decline of manufacturing jobs and the rise of the cognitive economy have negatively impacted men's job prospects and social roles. This has led to lower social trust, zero-sum mindsets, and more regressive gender norms among men. The article argues for redefining men's roles in an inclusive way that values both caretaking and producing, while also acknowledging the limited likelihood of a manufacturing resurgence.</p>

          <p>Officials in Southern California are utilizing sterile male mosquitoes to combat the invasive Aedes mosquito, which has been linked to a recent surge in dengue fever cases. The approach involves releasing thousands of sterile males to reduce the mosquito population, as eggs produced after mating with sterile males do not hatch. Data from vector control districts show encouraging results, with significant reductions in invasive Aedes mosquito populations in release areas. While challenges remain in scaling up the intervention, the technique offers an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical spraying.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering restricting visa applications from nationalities perceived as likely to overstay and claim asylum. The Home Office plans target countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, aiming to curb abuse by foreign nationals who arrive on work or study visas and then seek asylum. While the Home Office hasn't published exit check statistics since 2020, the move is intended to reduce asylum claims considered abusive. Labour's recent election losses have increased pressure to make changes to the immigration system.</p>

Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty, the company reiterated its full-year guidance. Revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis to 999 million euros, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to subdued consumer demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China.</p>

Despite his coalition having enough seats, 18 MPs dissented, resulting in a significant blow to Merz. The Bundestag now has 14 days to choose a chancellor, with no limit to the number of votes. Political commentators view Merz's defeat as a humiliation, potentially inflicted by members of the Social Democrat SPD, which recently signed a coalition deal with his conservatives.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are considering curtailing or ending Medicaid provider taxes, a move that could save the federal government approximately $600 billion over the next decade. These taxes, used by states to increase federal matching funds, could hit some Republican-led states the hardest, as their Medicaid budgets tend to rely more on this strategy. Critics describe the payments as gimmicks and scams, while proponents argue they are essential for funding Medicaid programs. The proposals circulating on Capitol Hill do not include provisions to replace any lost dollars with new funding sources.</p>
