          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX company's area in South Texas is now officially the city of Starbase, approved by residents in a local election where most voters were SpaceX employees. The city will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners, overseeing planning and taxation. Some nearby residents have voiced concerns about environmental impacts due to SpaceX's presence. A state bill could grant Starbase control over highway closures and beach access during launches, potentially causing conflict with Cameron County officials. The article highlights the ongoing development and regulatory issues surrounding Starbase and SpaceX's increasing operations in Texas.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Broadway, playing all 26 roles with the aid of camerawork and technology. The play explores the parallels between Dorian's obsession with his image and modern social media culture, where maintaining an idealized aesthetic is paramount. Snook uses a smartphone to broadcast herself on a large screen, manipulating filters to create a false perfection, highlighting the gap between appearance and reality. The article contrasts this with "Vanya," another play where a single actor embodies multiple characters, suggesting different ways of imagining oneself and engaging with others.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen U.S. government health-tracking programs have been eliminated due to layoffs and proposed budget cuts, potentially hindering the ability to monitor and improve public health. Programs tracking deaths, diseases, injuries, and violence have been affected, including those focused on pregnancies, lead poisoning, and sexual assault. Critics argue that these cuts will leave Americans in the dark about critical health trends, while officials claim the changes aim to eliminate waste and focus on emerging diseases.

          <p>Reform UK is exploring legal challenges to prevent migrants from being housed in asylum hotels within areas under its control, according to party chairman Zia Yusuf. The party plans to use judicial reviews and other available powers to resist the Home Office's housing policies. This stance follows Reform's gains in local elections, where they pledged to oppose asylum seeker housing. Yusuf also indicated that Reform aims to cut spending on diversity and inclusion initiatives, focusing on deporting individuals residing in the country illegally.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Second Term Marked by Loyalty and Lack of Dissent</h2>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Trump's choice of JD Vance as Vice President signaled a shift towards a royal court structure in his second term, characterized by loyalty and lack of dissent. Unlike his first term, where he was often checked by advisors and the Republican Party, Trump is now surrounded by enforcers and yes-men. This shift has eliminated the guardrails that previously tempered his most destructive impulses, leading to a more reckless and unchecked presidency. The article concludes that the ferocity and recklessness of this administration are intentional.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a landslide victory in Australia's election, bolstered by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over the cost-of-living crisis. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the president's policies and the perception of his influence on the conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, contributed to Dutton's defeat. Voters expressed concerns about economic instability and the potential for erratic policy decisions mirroring those of the Trump administration. The results indicate a preference for stable, centrist politics and a rejection of Trump-inspired rhetoric.</p>
