          <p>Kelly Ramsey, a former hotshot wildland firefighter, shares her experiences battling intense wildfires in North America. Ramsey describes the physical and mental challenges of the job, including long hours, dangerous conditions, and the emotional toll of witnessing the destruction caused by increasingly frequent and severe fires. She recounts a particularly harrowing experience at the August Complex fire in California, where a sudden wind shift nearly trapped her crew. Ramsey also discusses the factors contributing to the rise in extreme fires, such as prolonged droughts and insect infestations, and the importance of international cooperation in managing these disasters. The article emphasizes the physical and mental toll that firefighting has on individuals, leading to high attrition rates within wildland firefighting crews.

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. The MHRA advises using contraception while taking these GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, ranging from one to two months depending on the specific drug. Women using Mounjaro and oral contraceptives should also use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug or switch to another contraceptive method. The MHRA is concerned that the increasing popularity of these drugs means many women aren't using them safely or receiving proper advice.

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were successfully defused in Cologne, Germany, after the city's largest evacuation since the end of the war. More than 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center following the discovery of the bombs during road construction preparations. Experts managed to defuse the bombs within approximately one hour, according to city authorities. Unexploded bombs from wartime air raids are frequently found in Germany, necessitating large-scale precautionary evacuations, though this particular location was unusually prominent near Cologne's historic center.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murdering relatives with beef Wellington, is alleged by prosecutors to have documented herself using kitchen scales to calculate a lethal dose of toxic mushrooms. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to killing three people and attempting to murder another, claiming it was a tragic accident. Prosecutors presented images from Patterson's phone, taken in April 2023, depicting mushrooms being measured, which a fungi expert identified as "highly consistent" with death caps. Patterson denied intentionally putting the poisonous mushrooms in the meal and said she was scared and shouldn't have lied to police about foraging mushrooms and having a food dehydrator.

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein are experiencing a significant drop in U.S. demand due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the de minimis loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users (DAUs) decreased by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs fell by 25%. The decline is attributed to both platforms pulling back on U.S. advertising spending following the tariff announcements. Trump's administration ended the "de minimis" tariff exemption on May 2, which previously allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free.

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart Co. and Lawson Inc., have started selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka. This initiative aims to increase the availability of rice for consumers struggling with soaring rice prices. The rice, harvested in 2021, is being sold in small portions to make it more affordable, especially for individuals living alone. While other retailers sell rice in 5-kilogram bags for around 2,000 yen, Family Mart offers a 1-kg package for 388 yen, and Lawson sells 1-kg and 2-kg packages for 389 yen and 756 yen, respectively. The stores are limiting sales to one package per customer. The article reflects efforts to address rising food costs in Japan.</p>

The Dodgers' only run came from Andy Pages' solo home run, but the team has been unable to string together consistent wins due to pitching issues.
