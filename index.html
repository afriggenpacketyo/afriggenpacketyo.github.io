          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four people, including a 17-year-old, in connection with recent cyberattacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The attacks, which began in mid-April, involved data theft and ransomware, causing significant operational disruption and an estimated £300 million in lost profits for M&S. The arrests were made on suspicion of computer misuse, blackmail, and organized crime activities, with police seizing numerous electronic devices. This action is described as a significant step in an ongoing international investigation to bring those responsible to justice.</p>

          <p>Chocolate maker Ferrero has agreed to purchase cereal company WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, causing WK Kellogg's stock to surge by 30%. The acquisition marks another step in the consolidation of the packaged foods industry, as traditional cereal brands face declining sales. For the Italian-owned Ferrero, this move deepens its expansion into the U.S. market, following other major acquisitions like Nestle's U.S. candy business. The deal is expected to close in the latter half of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A trustee at Columbia University, Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, has publicly called for the university's board to comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding Title VI and antisemitism on campus. In a letter, she criticized the leadership's "lack of moral clarity" and demanded an apology, citing significant financial and reputational damage. The call for action follows the release of text messages where the acting president suggested Shendelman's removal from the board. The university faces the potential loss of federal funding and accreditation over its handling of the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., through a $400 million stock purchase. This investment aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are critical components for military technology like F-35 jets and drones, reducing reliance on China. The deal will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet production, including a new manufacturing facility. The move is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to secure critical mineral independence.</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky star Angel Reese has been announced as one of the cover athletes for the NBA 2K26 video game, an honor that has previously been given to only a few WNBA players. The announcement, which coincided with the launch of her signature Reebok shoe, has generated significant discussion and some backlash from fans who believed Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was a more expected choice. The debate continues a public narrative that has linked the two players since their 2023 NCAA championship matchup.

          <p>Vietnam's government has approved a plan to raise the special consumption tax on alcohol from 65% to 90% by 2031, aiming to curb what it sees as harmful drinking habits. The move comes as the country grapples with high rates of alcohol consumption, which is cited as the second-leading cause of death. While public health advocates like the WHO praise the policy, the alcohol industry has raised concerns, pointing to already declining sales and the risk of pushing consumers toward a dangerous unregulated market. The tax hike is also seen as a way to fund Vietnam's expanding public healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Nepal is experiencing a significant surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with the number of EVs increasing from 250 in 2020 to over 13,000 in 2024. This shift is driven by government policies that favor EVs with lower taxes compared to gasoline cars, and growing public awareness of severe air pollution in cities like Kathmandu. The government has set ambitious targets, aiming for 90% of new private vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric. The transition is seen as a key strategy to reduce the nation's carbon emissions and improve public health, leveraging its abundant hydropower resources for clean energy.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear" by Brian Anderson, details the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive and innovative sound system from the early 1970s. The system was an ambitious attempt to provide perfect, uniform audio for the entire audience by placing a gigantic array of speakers and amps directly behind the band. While utopian in concept, the wall was a logistical nightmare, weighing as much as a dozen elephants and proving incredibly complex and expensive to transport and operate. The book argues this technological hubris ultimately contributed to the band's temporary hiatus in 1974.</p>

          <h2>In-Depth Report Traces Los Angeles's Homelessness Crisis to Decades of Policy Failures</h2>

          <p>A comprehensive historical analysis by the Los Angeles Times argues that the city's massive homelessness crisis is not inevitable but the direct result of decades of policy decisions. The crisis began to take shape in the late 1970s, driven by a convergence of factors including the demolition of thousands of low-income housing units, the halt of public housing construction, and the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill without adequate community support. Exacerbated by soaring housing prices and the loss of manufacturing jobs, the core issue identified is a severe, human-created shortage of affordable housing.</p>

          <p>A staffer from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a team established by the Trump administration, has reportedly gained high-level access to a critical USDA payment system. This system controls billions of dollars in loans and payments and contains highly sensitive personal and financial data on America's farmers and ranchers. Insiders and former officials express alarm over the unprecedented access, citing serious privacy risks and the potential for disruption to vital agricultural support programs. Critics fear the team, which lacks agricultural expertise, could arbitrarily cut off funding and use the data in unintended ways.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken down the official website for the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a legally mandated report produced by government scientists that details the impacts of climate change. The move has erased the public-facing portal for all five assessments conducted since 2000 and has led to the dismissal of researchers working on the next report. Scientists and environmental groups have expressed alarm, fearing the administration will replace the authoritative, science-based report with misinformation or fail to meet its legal obligations. The latest assessment from 2023 warns of worsening climate impacts across every region of the U.S.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 2003 book "100 Suns," which collected declassified government photographs of U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1945 and 1962. The images, captured by military photographers, are described as both scientific records and propaganda, showcasing America's technological power. However, they also function as a form of unsettling art, depicting surreal, man-made fireballs against stark landscapes. The author notes that after the 1963 Test Ban Treaty moved tests underground, this visceral public record of the government's nuclear activities disappeared from view.</p>

          <p>"Dora the Explorer," the groundbreaking children's show, is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, marking a legacy of empowering young viewers and advancing Latino representation in media. Launched in 2000 during a "Latin Boom" in pop culture but also a period of anti-bilingual education sentiment, the show's use of Spanish as a problem-solving tool was revolutionary. The franchise continues to expand with a new live-action film, "Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado," and a rebooted animated series, demonstrating the enduring appeal of the adventurous, bilingual heroine for new generations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major Republican reconciliation package, signed into law by President Trump, includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, the changes could cause 22.3 million families to lose some or all of their benefits, with an average loss of $146 per month for those most affected. The legislation expands work requirements to older individuals and parents of teenagers, and imposes new financial burdens on states to cover administrative errors. This represents one of the largest cuts to SNAP in the program's history. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A brief dispatch from the federal building in New York City captures a tense scene at the immigration court. The article describes federal agents receiving a photo on their phones, huddling, and then detaining an asylum seeker moments after his hearing concluded. The migrant appeared to be shaking as agents held elevator doors open to take him into custody. The scene is presented as one of at least 23 similar detentions by ICE at that location on a single day, offering a brief but vivid snapshot of current immigration enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's burgeoning drone industry, forged and rapidly advanced by the war with Russia, is positioning itself to become an exporter of defense technology to European partners. As Kyiv prepares to loosen export restrictions, Ukrainian companies hope to leverage their unique battlefield experience to attract investment and form joint ventures, potentially producing drones outside Ukraine to protect manufacturing from attack. While European nations are also developing their own drone capabilities, Ukrainian firms argue their deep understanding of modern warfare tactics and countermeasures provides a strategic advantage that can benefit the continent's rearmament efforts.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas has risen to at least 120, with search and rescue teams continuing to look for more than 170 people who remain missing. The disaster, centered in Kerr County, was caused by the Guadalupe River swelling to unprecedented levels, devastating communities and a summer camp where at least 27 people died. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, allowing FEMA to support the ongoing, large-scale recovery efforts. The tragedy has also sparked scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the impact of federal budget cuts on forecasting.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva warns that the international order established after 1945 is on the verge of collapse. He cites the illegal use of force by world powers, the failure to act on crises like Gaza, and a hollowed-out global trading system as evidence of systemic failure. However, he argues against "deglobalization," stating that abandoning multilateral institutions would be a mistake. Instead, he calls for rebuilding these organizations on fairer, more inclusive foundations that reflect today's global realities and can address inequality, war, and the climate crisis.</p>
