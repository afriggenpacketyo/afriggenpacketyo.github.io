        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have introduced a bill proposing $880 billion in cuts, primarily to Medicaid, to offset $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, igniting a major political battle over healthcare. Republicans argue these cuts will eliminate waste and abuse, while Democrats warn that millions could lose coverage, and hospitals could close, with premiums rising. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposals would reduce healthcare coverage for 8.6 million people over the next decade, though the GOP aims to pass the bill by Memorial Day. This bill would also roll back Biden-era green energy programs.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli citizen held hostage since October 7, as part of mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire in Gaza. The release is intended to facilitate the reopening of crossings and the resumption of aid delivery, with Hamas officials expecting it to occur within 48 hours. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office acknowledged the move, stating it could lead to negotiations for the release of other hostages. The Alexander family expressed gratitude and urged continued efforts to free all remaining hostages, while President Trump hailed it as a positive step.

          <p>Japan's current account surplus hit a record 30.38 trillion yen ($208 billion) in fiscal 2024, marking the second consecutive year of record highs, driven by substantial returns on foreign investments, according to government data. This represents a 16.1 percent increase from the previous year, reaching the highest level since comparable data became available in fiscal 1985. Other key headlines include China and the U.S. agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism amidst tariff disputes, and the WTO head planning to meet with Japanese officials to discuss global trade concerns. Meanwhile, South Korea's presidential election campaign has commenced, and Japan's corporate bankruptcies for April have reached an 11-year high.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the U.S. must urgently build its AI computing infrastructure to compete with China and maintain national security and economic leadership. It emphasizes the need for massive investments in specialized cloud platforms, advanced cooling systems, cutting-edge chip technology, and a skilled workforce. The author calls for transparent regulations, expedited energy development, and public-private partnerships to train more plumbers, electricians, and engineers. By treating AI infrastructure as a strategic asset, the U.S. can unlock a $20 trillion opportunity by 2030 and secure its future in economic growth and national security.</p>

          <p>Recent China-US trade talks in Geneva are viewed as carrying both economic and political significance, potentially leading to substantive deals addressing tariffs and trade barriers. The agreement to establish a "trade consultation mechanism" provides interim political relief for both powers without appearing weak on the trade war front. While the US seeks to demonstrate wins, China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience. China's strategic patience and resilience-building aim to insulate its domestic economy from external shocks while engaging selectively in global markets.</p>

The driver of the Nissan SUV died at the scene after their vehicle became disabled and blocked a lane. The tour bus, carrying approximately 63 passengers, veered across all lanes before colliding with a guardrail. At least two people sustained critical injuries, and the cause of the collision remains under investigation.

          <p>Reports that Donald Trump's administration may accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical concerns regarding bribery and corruption. There is a history of U.S. presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers, ranging from clothes and antiques to animals, which are typically managed through a complex bureaucratic process. Under U.S. law, foreign gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the United States and must be logged and disposed of by the White House Gift Unit, though presidents can retain gifts by paying fair market value. The article provides a historical context of presidential gift-giving and the rules governing it.</p>

Challenges include gaining public acceptance and assessing disease risks to livestock.

          <p>Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, and fellow Green MP Ellie Chowns have launched a joint leadership bid, joining Deputy Leader Zack Polanski in the contest. With Carla Denyer stepping down, Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its most ambitious chapter, focusing on national politics and winning power across the country. They emphasize their ability to win seats and put Green ideas at the heart of the next government. Polanski's campaign focuses on building a mass movement to counter Reform UK.</p>

Protests, triggered by a train station collapse, have grown into the largest and most extensive movement yet, reaching deep into Serbian society. Despite government attempts to suppress them, protesters are demanding accountability and early elections, organizing without leaders or hierarchies. The movement is based on horizontal decision-making, and equal unity in solidarity. The protesters are also trying to raise international awareness of the struggle.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East and aims to facilitate humanitarian aid entry. Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier, was captured during the October 7 attack. The release is expected to involve a temporary halt to Israeli military activity. Trump hailed the move as a step in good faith, while Alexander's family expressed gratitude and urged further negotiations for all remaining hostages.</p>
