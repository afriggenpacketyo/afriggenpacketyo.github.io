          <p>Two Scottish men, identified as Eddie Lyons Jnr and Ross Monaghan, with connections to criminal gangs were fatally shot at a bar in Fuengirola, Andalusia, Spain. A masked gunman opened fire at Monaghans Bar, resulting in their deaths, and then fled in a vehicle. Ross Monaghan had previously been acquitted of a gangland murder and was himself shot in 2017, while Eddie Lyons Jnr had also been shot prior to the 2010 murder of Kevin 'Gerbil' Carroll. Police Scotland is coordinating with Spanish authorities to investigate potential links to a recent gangland feud in Scotland, as similar shootings have occurred in the Costa del Sol area, potentially related to drug crime.</p>

          <p>The shadow justice secretary has proposed arming prison officers who deal with violent inmates, suggesting that specialist guards should have Taser stun guns and baton rounds. Robert Jenrick told the BBC that this measure would provide officers with greater "confidence" in handling threats. The Conservatives also advocate for secure armories in maximum security jails, to be used as a last resort. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) stated that some prison officers will use Tasers on a trial basis this summer, but argued that giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.</p>

          <p>Poland's presidential runoff election features a stark ideological choice between a pro-European liberal, Rafal Trzaskowski, and a staunch nationalist, Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski, backed by the governing Civic Coalition party, promises to soften Poland's abortion ban and protect LGBTQ rights. Nawrocki, endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda, is a defender of traditional Polish values and is skeptical of the EU. The race is expected to be tight, with polls showing the difference between the candidates within the margin of error.</p>
