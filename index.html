          <p>A controversial plan to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land across 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee to supposedly ease housing costs, faced strong bipartisan backlash from lawmakers and conservation groups.
