          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking ring, has indicated she will only testify before a House committee if she receives immunity or a presidential pardon. Her lawyer stated that without such protections, she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid potential self-incrimination, as her legal appeals are still pending. The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Maxwell as part of an investigation into federal handling of sex-crime cases but has stated it will not consider granting her immunity. The request comes amid ongoing legal battles and public scrutiny, with victims' families strongly opposing any form of leniency for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling by more than half compared to the previous year and missing market expectations. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 94% plunge in profits from its crucial chip division, which faced challenges from inventory adjustments and export restrictions. Despite the downturn, the company's mobile division saw growth fueled by strong sales of its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones. Samsung expressed cautious optimism for the second half of the year, anticipating a gradual market recovery driven by demand for AI and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

The "radar-related" issue led to over 150 flight cancellations and grounded thousands more, prompting carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet to voice strong criticism. This incident echoes a similar major outage in August 2023, raising concerns about the resilience of critical travel infrastructure.

          <p>Shares of Arm Holdings fell after the company reported first-quarter revenue that slightly missed analyst expectations, primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated growth in smartphone royalties. The chip architecture firm also signaled a strategic shift, with CEO Rene Haas confirming that Arm is considering designing its own processors or chiplets, a move that could turn current customers into competitors. While the company's guidance for the next quarter was in line with forecasts, investors showed concern over the core business performance and potential risks of the new strategy. The company also noted uncertainty regarding the potential impact of future U.S. tariffs on end-product demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Sub-indexes for employment and new orders also remained in contraction territory, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The data was released after a high-level Politburo meeting that did not announce any major new economic stimulus measures to counteract the slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

In a public statement, Harris explained that after careful consideration, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she intends to remain active in politics. Sources close to Harris indicated that she seriously weighed the gubernatorial run but ultimately concluded she could have a greater impact on the national stage. This decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign and allows her to focus on campaigning for other Democrats.</p>

While Russia experienced waves up to 16 feet, the impact on other regions was less severe than initially feared, with most warnings later downgraded or canceled.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies reveals a complex economic impact on the United States. While the import taxes have significantly increased government revenue, they have also contributed to a widening of the U.S. trade deficit as companies stockpiled goods to avoid the levies. The average U.S. tariff rate is now at its highest since 1934, and economists are beginning to see signs of this feeding through to higher consumer prices for certain imported goods. The policy has also shifted global trade patterns, with countries like China reducing exports to the U.S. while increasing trade with other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientific Explainer Details the Formation and Dangers of Tsunamis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:03:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake, this article explains the science behind how tsunamis are generated, move, and impact coastal areas. A tsunami is typically triggered by a large underwater earthquake, at least a magnitude 6.5, that causes vertical displacement of the seafloor, creating a series of powerful waves. These waves can travel at speeds comparable to a jet airplane in the deep ocean and, while they may be unnoticeable at sea, they slow down and build to dangerous heights as they approach shallower coastal waters. Experts emphasize that even small tsunamis can create extremely powerful currents, making it crucial to heed all official warnings.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team observed dense fields of tube worms, clam beds, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme high-pressure, pitch-black environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemosynthesis, where organisms derive energy from chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these "chemosynthetic" communities may be more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into how life adapts.</p>

          <p>The debate over the effects of screen time on children's development continues, with some UK scientists arguing that concrete evidence of widespread harm is lacking. Psychologists point out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use, from educational content to passive "doomscrolling." While some studies correlate high screen use with mental health issues, others find little to no link, suggesting factors like loneliness may be more significant. This scientific uncertainty leaves parents with inconsistent guidance, caught between fears of digital harm and the reality of raising children in a technologically integrated world.</p>

Vueling and Spanish police maintain the group was removed for disruptive and unsafe behavior, an allegation disputed by the group and other passengers. The incident has led to accusations of antisemitism, which the airline denies, and has prompted France's foreign minister to express "deep concern" to the airline's CEO.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8 magnitude tremor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula did not cause a catastrophic Pacific-wide tsunami. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in mitigating its impact. The main energy of the resulting tsunami was directed into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching populated coastlines. While the area near the epicenter saw damage, this "best-case scenario" for a distant tsunami avoided the widespread destruction seen in past events.</p>
