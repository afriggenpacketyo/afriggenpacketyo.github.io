            <p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, stipulating that detainees must be afforded due process to challenge their removal. The court's majority opinion stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction, while the dissenting justices criticized the government's actions and the potential harm to those deported to El Salvador. This ruling comes amidst rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as the Trump administration continues to assert executive power over immigration matters. The decision confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.</p>

Taurasi, who retired after 20 seasons, admitted she was wrong to say Clark would face a tough reality in the league. Clark averaged 19.2 points, 8.4 assists, and 5.7 rebounds, earning Rookie of the Year and All-WNBA First Team honors.

            <p>US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to advise the CDC to cease recommending water fluoridation nationwide, citing potential health risks. This announcement follows Utah's recent ban on fluoride in public drinking water, making it the first state to do so. The EPA is also reviewing scientific studies on fluoride's health risks to inform potential changes to national standards. Kennedy's stance aligns with concerns about fluoride's potential neurotoxic effects, while supporters of fluoridation argue it's a vital public health measure for preventing tooth decay.</p>

In response, Trump said, he would add another 50% tariff increase on Chinese imports — a move that would result in Chinese products facing 104% import duties by Wednesday.</p>

            <p>A former Wisconsin state Supreme Court justice, Michael Gableman, who led a controversial 2020 election probe, has agreed to surrender his law license to settle misconduct violations. The state Office of Lawyer Regulation filed a 10-count complaint against Gableman, accusing him of making false statements, disrupting court proceedings, and violating open records law during the probe. The agreement, which is subject to approval by a referee and the Supreme Court, would result in a three-year suspension of Gableman's license.</p>

            <p>Mongolia’s parliament has ratified a deal with China to jointly construct a new cross-border rail connection between the two countries, as it looks to forge closer ties with its southern neighbour amid US President Donald Trump’s tariff war. Construction of the 19.5-kilometre (12.1-mile) railway – which will allow Mongolia to ramp up its coal exports to China – had been held up for over a decade, but the project has gained fresh momentum in recent months.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to remain calm and avoid panic selling despite his belief that a recession is likely on the horizon. He acknowledged the negative impact of President Trump's tariffs on the U.S. economy but emphasized that the economic system is not in jeopardy. Cramer suggested that the market may present buying opportunities for certain stocks that have declined significantly. He believes Trump may eventually reverse course on the tariffs to avoid further economic damage (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A false report shared on Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, about a potential pause in tariffs led to significant market fluctuations on Monday. The erroneous headline, originating from a relatively obscure X account, spread rapidly through social media and news outlets. The White House's denial of the report caused the markets to reverse course, resulting in a $2.4 trillion swing within minutes. This incident highlights the dangers of misinformation on social media and the challenges of verifying information in a fast-paced online environment.</p>

            <p>President Trump's administration is sending mixed signals regarding the sweeping tariffs, leading to confusion among investors and foreign governments. While some officials suggest negotiations are possible, others claim the tariffs are non-negotiable. Trump himself stated that both permanent tariffs and negotiations can coexist. The conflicting messages have fueled market volatility and raised concerns about the future of global trade relations. Despite the criticism, Trump maintains that the tariffs are necessary to reset the table and prioritize America's interests.</p>
