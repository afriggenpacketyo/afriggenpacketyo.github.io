          <p>Erin has rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with sustained winds reaching 160 mph. The National Hurricane Center is urging Caribbean islands to monitor the storm, warning of heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions as it passes north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend. While current forecast models show the hurricane curving northward and remaining offshore from the U.S. East Coast, meteorologists continue to watch its path closely. The storm's development comes as the hurricane season approaches its typical peak activity period.</p>

Thompson finished with a meet record time of 9.87 seconds, while Lyles came in second at 9.90 seconds.

          <p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has explicitly denied any intention to run for president in 2028, calling such claims a "flat-out lie." His statement comes after conservative influencer Laura Loomer raised concerns that one of Kennedy's top aides was laying the groundwork for a future campaign. In a social media post, Kennedy affirmed his loyalty to President Trump and their shared "make America healthy again" agenda, suggesting the rumors are being spread by the "swamp" to create division. Kennedy, who ran for president in 2024 before joining the Trump administration, emphasized his focus is on his current role.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all its operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with the union representing over 10,000 of its flight attendants, leading to a nationwide strike. The shutdown is expected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily, with negotiations stalling over key issues like wages and compensation for unpaid work. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) rejected the airline's proposal for government-directed arbitration, proceeding with the first flight attendant strike since 1985. The airline has advised affected customers not to go to the airport and is offering refunds, though rebooking options are limited during the peak travel season.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Denzel Washington strongly condemned the concept of "cancel culture," questioning the importance of public support and online followers. He stated that his guidance comes from his faith in God, not from popular opinion, asserting that one "can't be canceled if you haven't signed up." Washington dismissed the idea that followers are a form of currency, arguing that his focus is on leading a life guided by spiritual principles rather than seeking approval from others. Director Spike Lee, who was present during the interview, echoed Washington's sentiments on the matter.</p>

The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search operation was launched after he failed to return, and a rescue team located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to secure a leading position in the energy and space sectors. The technology involves building orbital stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action highlights that China's current research, primarily led by universities, lacks the capacity for such a large-scale project. The article notes the need for a top-down national strategy to close the technology gap with countries like the United States.</p>

          <p>A series of articles highlights the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children, providing support when needed but allowing them the space to navigate their own challenges. This contrasts with the instinct to immediately solve every problem for a child, a method that can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The articles argue that stepping back can be one of the most beneficial actions a parent can take for their child's long-term growth.</p>

          <p>This analysis contends that President Trump's actions leading up to and during the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin have left the U.S. with "no cards" to play in negotiations over the war in Ukraine. The article cites the administration's easing of sanctions, halting of military aid, and public criticism of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as moves that have strengthened Putin's hand. It frames the summit not as a new beginning but as the culmination of a policy that dismantles U.S. foreign policy tools, leaving the president's desire for a peace deal unsupported by credible pressure. The author concludes that the U.S. must re-arm Ukraine and expand sanctions to regain leverage.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas corrections department reveals that convicted murderer Grant Hardin, known as the "devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his May 25th escape. Hardin told investigators that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather materials and fashion a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of the facility. The report details multiple security failures, including an unsupervised dock and a guard unlocking a gate without confirming his identity, which have led to two employees being fired. Hardin survived in the woods for over a week before his capture on June 6th.</p>

This action follows a previous seizure of £2.7 million from Tate and his brother in December 2024 for failure to pay taxes on business revenue.

This follows a warning from the state board of education to the Hillsborough County school district, which resulted in over 600 titles being pulled to avoid potential legal action. Fearing similar repercussions, at least nine other districts have proactively removed books, including classics by Maya Angelou and Kurt Vonnegut, often without a formal review process.

The initiative, which began after learning of a student who arrived at UC Berkeley with only a trash bag of possessions, aims to level the playing field and give these students a sense of belonging.

This extra time is used for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, rather than a rigid regimen.

          <p>A new working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional milestones of adulthood. Compared to previous generations, fewer are moving out of their parents' homes, securing jobs, getting married, and having children. The research attributes this shift to increased economic barriers, such as the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. The paper notes that economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over marriage, which is increasingly viewed as a "capstone" achievement rather than a foundational step into adulthood.</p>

While relieved that the summit did not result in immediate concessions at Ukraine's expense, the spectacle was viewed as a diplomatic victory for Putin, who has been largely isolated internationally.

Samsung's broader range of products at various price points also contributes to its gains.

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and her former bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, have been charged with fraud and corruption over allegations they used public funds to facilitate a personal relationship. A federal indictment claims the pair took numerous personal trips together, both domestically and internationally, while Vappie fraudulently claimed to be on duty, costing the city over $70,000. Prosecutors also allege they used a city-owned apartment as a personal residence and attempted to conceal their activities by using auto-deleting messages. The charges against the mayor, who is set to leave office in January, include conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction of justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative feelings. The first step is to visualize the learning process as a winding path between "not knowing" and "knowing" to normalize the struggle. The second is to engage in positive self-talk, reframing difficult moments as part of the growth process. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds the body's tolerance for discomfort and fosters resilience over time.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has indicated his support for redrawing the state's congressional district maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a move critics argue is a partisan effort to secure a larger Republican majority. Bolstered by a recent state supreme court ruling that approved a previous map diluting Black voting power, state Republicans are forming a committee to explore further redistricting. DeSantis argues that a mid-decade redistricting is appropriate, potentially targeting districts held by prominent South Florida Democrats. Opponents have condemned the plan as a blatant gerrymandering attempt that subverts the will of voters who previously passed a "fair districts" amendment.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that the "best way to end the horrific war" is through a direct peace agreement rather than a ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and several European leaders, who reportedly welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump suggested that if the talks with Zelenskyy are successful, a subsequent meeting with Putin could be scheduled to finalize an agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less and are increasingly concerned about the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where reported drinking has declined sharply since the 1990s. While this shift points to significant public health benefits, the article notes a potential downside if it is linked to a broader decline in social interaction.</p>

          <p>Health officials are alerting up to 500 recent guests of Grand Teton National Park who may have been exposed to rabies after bats were found infesting a row of eight cabins at the Jackson Lake Lodge. The problem was discovered in late July, and while the few bats tested were negative for the virus, officials are taking precautions because a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. Rabies is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear, so authorities are recommending prophylactic treatment for high-risk individuals. The affected cabins have been closed since the discovery, and officials are contacting guests from 38 states and seven countries.</p>

In a public letter, Engine Capital called for improved operational excellence, cost reductions, portfolio optimization, and a board refresh. The firm criticized Avantor for flawed leadership, poor capital allocation on overpriced acquisitions, and for rebuffing a potential takeover offer in 2023 at a significant premium. Engine Capital suggests that if these changes are made, the stock value could nearly double, but also proposes selling the company as an alternative path to create shareholder value.

The lawsuit cited numerous posts where Stewartson accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and of planning the January 6th Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court, finding that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described the legal action as an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting on Patel.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are grappling with a combination of extreme weather events driven by the climate crisis and economic hardship exacerbated by the Trump administration's trade tariffs. Unpredictable conditions, such as last year's drought and this year's excessive rainfall, have significantly reduced crop yields for corn and soybeans. Simultaneously, retaliatory tariffs from China have caused U.S. soybean exports to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing prices and squeezing farm incomes. Despite the financial strain caused by these policies, many farmers in the rural political base continue to support the administration, creating a complex economic and political situation.</p>
