          <h2>Microsoft's Shares Surge After Earnings and Optimistic Forecast</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 18:16:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft's shares experienced a significant increase of around 9% following a report of stronger-than-anticipated quarterly earnings. This surge was fueled by the robust performance of its Azure cloud business and a surprisingly optimistic forecast for the upcoming period. The company's revenue grew by 13% year-over-year, with net income climbing by 18%. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures reaching $16.75 billion, up nearly 53%. This optimistic outlook provided reassurance to investors concerned about the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on the tech sector.</p>

          <p>Meta's shares saw a rise of up to 5% after the company announced stronger-than-expected revenue for the first quarter, along with second-quarter guidance aligning with Wall Street's anticipations. First-quarter sales rose 16% year-over-year, while net income surged 35%. Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, cautioned about reduced ad spending from Asia e-commerce exporters, attributing it to uncertainty surrounding ongoing trade discussions. Despite these concerns, CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate macroeconomic uncertainty. The company's Reality Labs hardware division reported an operating loss of $4.2 billion, although this was less than expected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks mounted a comeback after early losses, largely disregarding new government data indicating a contraction in the U.S. economy during the first quarter. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed in positive territory, despite an initial sharp decline following the Commerce Department's report of a 0.3% economic contraction. Economists cautioned that the GDP number might not fully reflect economic growth, attributing part of the decline to a surge in imports ahead of tariffs. Investors also reacted positively to a report indicating a slowdown in inflation. President Trump blamed stock market performance on President Biden, citing the upcoming tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Hamilton County Coroner's Office has identified Daniel Thomas Halloran as the tenth victim recovered from Fox Hollow Farm, the property of suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister. Halloran disappeared in 1993, and his remains were identified through DNA analysis. Baumeister is believed to have lured gay men to his home in the 1980s and 1990s, where he allegedly killed them and buried their bodies on his 18-acre property. Investigators found around 10,000 bone fragments and charred bones on the property. In 1996, Baumeister committed suicide shortly after bone fragments were discovered, prompting the investigation.</p>

          <p>Florida is on the verge of prohibiting fluoride from its public drinking water, pending Governor Ron DeSantis's signature on new legislation. This move would make Florida the second state, after Utah, to enact such a ban. DeSantis has previously labeled water fluoridation as "forced medication," reflecting a viewpoint shared by some who question its necessity and potential health impacts. However, dental and health experts largely agree that controlled fluoride exposure is essential for preventing tooth decay, citing its significant public health benefits. The state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has called water fluoridation "public health malpractice."</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have officially signed an agreement to establish the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, granting the U.S. rights to Ukrainian rare earth minerals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that this agreement sends a clear message to Russia about the Trump Administration's commitment to a peaceful, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The deal aims to attract global investment into Ukraine, with assurances that entities involved in financing Russia's war efforts will not benefit from the reconstruction. The signing follows earlier delays due to disagreements over the timing of the mineral resources agreement and the investment fund document.</p>

The investment tracker currently lists 47 projects involving 50 companies, with technology and AI projects leading the list.

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to pave the way for the nation's first religious charter school funded directly with taxpayer money during oral arguments on Wednesday. The case stems from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract, citing constitutional bans on government-sponsored sectarian education. The justices debated the application of the First Amendment's religion clauses, weighing the prohibition of state establishment of religion against the protection of free exercise of religious faith. The court's three liberal members argued that charter schools are public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology using taxpayer funds.</p>

Smartmatic counters that Fox News' conduct cost the company 100 jobs and billions in asset value. Fox News maintains that reporting on allegations made by a sitting president and his lawyers was newsworthy and protected by the 1st Amendment.

          <p>President Trump claimed that egg prices are falling, but some food economists say the claim is misleading. While wholesale egg prices have dropped, retail egg prices, or the prices paid by shoppers, have increased since Trump took office. Experts say that any president has minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs. The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, a 25% spike. Trump stated that eggs are down 87% since he got involved, which is an overstatement of the drop in wholesale egg prices.</p>

          <h2>Congress Yields to Trump in First 100 Days Amid Looming Pressure Tests</h2>

          <p>During President Trump's second term, Congress has largely acquiesced to his executive actions, enacting just five laws in the first 100 days, a modern low. Trump has enjoyed unilateral party control, facing little pushback as he legislates through executive actions, ignores Senate consultation statutes, and upends the economy with tariffs. However, some in Congress are signaling unease, with concerns about retaliation. The real test of congressional muscle will be how they handle next year's spending bills. Ignoring parliamentary history can destabilize Congress.</p>

          <p>Meta has cautioned that European users might encounter a "materially worse" experience following a pivotal regulatory decision by the European Commission. Meta expects modifications to its model, in line with feedback from the EC, could result in a worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to its European business and revenue. The company stated that these impacts could begin as early as the third quarter of this year and may persist while it appeals the decision. Meta's announcement comes as it released quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The company touted its AI tools, stating that Meta AI now has almost 1 billion monthly actives.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has asserted that it possesses "credible intelligence" indicating that India intends to carry out military action within the next 24-36 hours, citing alleged involvement in a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir.

Pakistan denies any involvement and has offered to conduct an investigation. The United Nations has warned of potentially "catastrophic" consequences should the two nuclear-armed neighbors engage in war. The U.S. Secretary of State has called on both sides to de-escalate.</p>

Officials in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, urged residents to stay home as crews worked to clear debris. The same storm system also affected southern Quebec in Canada, where a teenage boy was critically injured and thousands were left without power.

The justices appeared divided, with Republican appointees largely sympathetic to the school and Democratic ones wary.

A ruling in favor of the school could affect laws in 46 other states that authorize charter schools. The Oklahoma school is to be operated by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa.</p>
