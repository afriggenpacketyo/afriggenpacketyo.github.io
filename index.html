        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have dramatically escalated, with both nations conducting airstrikes against each other's military targets using drones and missiles. Each country accuses the other of initiating the attacks, claiming they acted in retaliation. Pakistan reports intercepting Indian missiles aimed at its air bases, while India alleges Pakistan targeted civilian areas and military infrastructure. The conflict has intensified following a terrorist attack in India-administered Kashmir, which India attributes to Pakistan, further straining the already fragile relationship between the two nuclear-armed rivals. The United States has urged both parties to de-escalate and offered assistance in facilitating constructive talks to prevent future conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst rising tensions in the Kashmir region, the Indian government has implemented stringent measures to control the flow of information, including blocking social media accounts and restricting news portals. This move has sparked widespread condemnation from press freedom activists, who view it as censorship during a critical period when both sides are engaged in competing narratives. The government has ordered the blocking of thousands of accounts on X and directed online streaming platforms to remove Pakistani-origin content, citing national security concerns. Critics argue that these restrictions create an environment ripe for misinformation and limit access to reliable reporting, undermining the public's ability to stay informed during the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan expresses his excitement about an upcoming episode set in Lagos, Nigeria, marking the first time the show has been primarily set in Africa. Adesoji Kukoyi, who has been watching Doctor Who since childhood, describes his elation upon learning that the Tardis would be landing in his home city. The episode is significant not only for Mr. Kukoyi but also for the show, as it embraces a new cultural setting and storyline. The episode's writer, Inua Ellams, reflects on why it has taken 62 years for the Doctor to visit Africa, suggesting it may be due to a lack of writers confident enough to create an authentic African story.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China resume formal trade talks, analysts predict a wide range of potential outcomes, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations. Ideal scenarios involve a deal that gradually reduces existing tariffs, while worst-case scenarios could see either party walking out without consensus, leading to market instability. Some analysts suggest a possible pause in import duties, similar to a previous offer from the U.S. government, to create a timeline for negotiating the tariffs. The current trade landscape includes significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports by the U.S., with China responding in kind, highlighting the high stakes of the discussions.</p>

While China still relies on the West for advanced technologies, its willingness to use economic warfare has redefined its global relationships.

          <p>This New York Times article reports that Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years. Experts estimate that the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact location and timing remain uncertain. The spacecraft, weighing approximately 1,050 pounds and equipped with a heat shield, has a chance of surviving its descent and partially impacting the surface. Authorities assure that the risk of injuries on the ground is low, though its precise landing spot is currently unknown.</p>
