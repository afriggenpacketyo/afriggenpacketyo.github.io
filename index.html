          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a thorough examination of the Federal Reserve, suggesting its entire mission and operational success should be reassessed. This call comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and the central bank over interest rate policies and reports of President Trump considering the dismissal of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent criticized the Fed for what he termed "fear mongering" over tariffs and argued for a potential rate cut given moderating inflation, questioning the effectiveness of the institution's current mindset and approach.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Security researchers have identified a new vulnerability in Android devices called "TapTrap," which tricks users into granting dangerous permissions through a clever visual deception. The exploit works by overlaying a nearly invisible screen on top of a legitimate app, capturing taps intended for the visible interface and redirecting them to hidden permission prompts. A study found that approximately 76% of tested Play Store apps are susceptible because they lack specific safeguards against such attacks. Google has acknowledged the issue and is planning a future update to mitigate the threat.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is set to officially end its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seats becoming available for flights starting January 27. This major shift is part of a broader business model overhaul aimed at generating new revenue and aligning the carrier with its more profitable competitors. The new system will feature eight boarding groups determined by factors like elite status, fare type, and seat location, replacing the familiar A-B-C boarding process. This change, along with new baggage fees, marks a significant transformation for the airline's iconic customer experience.</p>

          <p>A tragic aviation accident occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, when a Chinese-made F-7 BJI training aircraft crashed into the Milestone School and College campus, resulting in at least 19 fatalities and over 100 injuries. The crash, which happened while students were in class, is the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in over four decades. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the incident, which left the plane's wreckage mangled against a school building.

          <p>A Nashville judge has ordered that death-row inmate Byron Black's implanted heart device must be turned off moments before his scheduled lethal injection. The ruling addresses concerns from Black's attorneys that the device could repeatedly and painfully shock him as the execution drug stops his heart. The 69-year-old inmate, convicted of a 1988 triple murder, has multiple health issues and his lawyers are also pursuing claims of intellectual disability to halt the execution. This decision adds a complex medical and ethical layer to the state's capital punishment procedures.</p>

          <p>The All England Club's ambitious plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued that the expansion, which includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium, was unlawful as the land was protected. However, the judge ruled that the Greater London Authority's decision to grant planning permission was a rational and properly exercised judgment. This expansion will allow the prestigious tournament to host its qualifying events on-site for the first time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As many high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) opened in recent years begin to mature, financial experts are cautioning savers against common pitfalls. One major error is allowing a CD to automatically renew at the bank's current, often lower, interest rate without shopping around for better offers. Experts also advise against chasing the absolute highest rate without considering the time commitment and one's own financial goals, as liquidity needs can change. Instead of moving funds to a low-interest regular savings account, savers should reevaluate their financial situation and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has issued a warning, projecting a preliminary net loss of approximately $2.7 billion for the first half of 2025. The company attributes the significant loss to the impact of U.S. tariffs, which are expected to cost around 300 million euros, and substantial pre-tax charges of about 3.3 billion euros. These charges stem from costs related to program cancellations, platform impairments, and restructuring efforts. The announcement from the maker of Jeep and Ram vehicles comes after it suspended its financial guidance in April, signaling a challenging period for the world's fourth-largest automaker.

          <p>The state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record by discovering a significant uranium deposit at a depth of over 3,000 meters. The discovery was made in a sandstone-type deposit, which is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine than other uranium sources. This breakthrough in deep-earth exploration technology is crucial for China, a country that heavily relies on uranium imports to fuel its nuclear power plants and weapons programs. Last year, China produced 1,700 tonnes of uranium but needed to import 13,000 tonnes to meet its demand.</p>

          <p>According to leadership expert Jennifer Schielke, bosses who frequently use flattery to win over their employees are employing a flawed and ineffective tactic. She argues that excessive or insincere praise often comes across as manipulative and points to a leader's own insecurity rather than genuine appreciation. Instead of trying to be popular, effective leaders should focus on authentic interactions, empathy, and addressing difficult issues directly. Schielke suggests that making employees feel valued through meaningful actions, like listening to their needs and fostering a positive culture, is far more beneficial than offering empty compliments.</p>

While it's often faster for adults to do the work, involving children in tasks like cleaning or cooking helps develop crucial motor skills, responsibility, and confidence. Researchers suggest that instead of micromanaging or shooing them away, parents should find a middle ground, allowing kids to participate at their own level. Turning chores into a shared social activity, rather than using bribes or charts, can foster a sense of belonging and familial contribution.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man in New York has died from injuries sustained after being violently pulled into an MRI machine by the device's powerful magnet. The man, Keith McAllister, was wearing a nearly 20-pound metal weight-training chain around his neck when he entered the scanning room to help his wife. The machine's magnetic force immediately snatched him, causing a fatal medical episode. The incident highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which exert immense force on metallic objects, a danger that regulators and medical institutes explicitly warn about to prevent such tragic projectile accidents.</p>

          <p>China has officially begun construction on what is planned to be the world's largest hydropower dam, located on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in the Tibetan Plateau. The massive project, estimated to cost $170 billion, is intended to help China meet its renewable energy and carbon reduction goals. However, the dam has sparked significant concern from downstream countries, India and Bangladesh, which rely on the river, known there as the Brahmaputra, for water. Environmental NGOs and geopolitical analysts have also warned of irreversible ecological damage and the potential for China to gain strategic leverage over its neighbors.</p>

          <p>For savers looking to protect their money from inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) remain a strong option, with top rates currently outpacing inflation. While the national average for a one-year CD is just over 2% APY, online banks are offering significantly higher yields, with some reaching up to 4.45% APY for various terms. The article notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs often provide better rates than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed a controversial policy shift that would link development aid for African nations to their cooperation on migration enforcement. Under this plan, a country's willingness to manage border controls and accept the return of deported migrants could directly impact the financial aid it receives from the EU. This move has drawn sharp criticism from humanitarian organizations and African policy experts, who label it as coercive, neocolonial, and a distortion of development goals. Critics argue the policy ignores the root causes of migration, such as conflict and poverty, some of which are exacerbated by European policies.</p>

          <p>EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson has made a highly ambitious long-term price prediction for Ethereum, suggesting its value could eventually reach $1.5 million per coin. Jackson's reasoning is tied to his belief that global commerce will increasingly move onto blockchain rails, with Ethereum's dominance in the stablecoin and tokenization sectors driving its value. He argues that as trillions of dollars in assets become tokenized, the demand for ETH as the network's transactional and security layer will skyrocket. While most analysts are bullish on Ethereum's potential, Jackson's specific, multi-million dollar projection stands out as exceptionally optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>
