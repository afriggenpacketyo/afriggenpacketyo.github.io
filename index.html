            <h2>Global Markets Surge After Trump Delays Some Tariff Hikes</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 05:40:13 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Global markets experienced a significant upswing following President Trump's decision to postpone tariff increases for 90 days, excluding China. Japan's Nikkei 225 index led the surge with a 9.1% jump, reflecting investor relief. However, U.S. futures dipped, and oil prices declined, indicating some caution. Trump's move came after acknowledging countries negotiating on trade and followed a rally in U.S. stocks, driven by hopes of de-escalation in trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes decisions regarding school phone bans should rest with head teachers, not the government. A survey revealed that most schools already restrict phone use, but children are spending more time on devices at home. Dame Rachel emphasizes the importance of parental boundaries and tech companies taking responsibility for online safety. She supports head teachers who choose to ban phones, advocating for research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's phone use.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs economists project that Saudi Arabia's budget deficit could more than double due to declining oil prices, exacerbated by waning demand and trade war fears. The kingdom requires oil prices above $90 a barrel to balance its budget, but Goldman Sachs forecasts prices around $62, potentially leading to a $70-$75 billion deficit. This situation could force Saudi Arabia to borrow more, cut spending on ambitious projects like Neom, and potentially sell assets. While Saudi Arabia's debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively low, financing such a large deficit in international markets would be challenging. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As the US-China trade war intensifies with escalating tariffs, economists suggest the two countries are competing for long-term economic resilience. A stronger dose of government stimulus is seen as crucial for China to boost domestic demand. After the series of back-and-forth tariff salvoes, Washington has imposed a 125 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, while Beijing’s new levy on US goods has risen to 84 per cent, both effective now.

            <p>Tom Thibodeau, the Knicks coach, has a reputation for overplaying his starters, leading to concerns about injuries. However, data analysis reveals no clear pattern of Thibodeau-coached players being more injury-prone than others. NBA injury data is often opaque, making it difficult to isolate meaningful trends. Injuries have been rising across the NBA for over a decade, regardless of coaching style. Depth may be crucial for teams to withstand the increasing injury storm.</p>

The NIA has faced criticism for enforcing a policy requiring mainland-born spouses to provide documentation of abandoning their mainland nationality. Failure to comply could result in revocation of residence permits and household registration. The 2004 revision to the island’s immigration law requires this documentation.</p>

Dalio also recommends cutting the U.S. deficit to 3% of GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's social media post urging investors to "BUY!!!" coincided with his announcement of a tariff pause, causing stocks to soar. The S&P 500 gained back $4 trillion in value. Trump's 53% ownership stake in Trump Media rose by $415 million. Trump Media closed up 22.67%, soaring twice as much as the broader market.

            <p>Isa Guha reflects on the appointment of Charlotte Edwards as the new head coach of the England cricket team. Edwards, known for her leadership and ability to make tough decisions, is expected to mark a turning point for the team. She won't be afraid of making difficult calls here if anything doesn't align with the vision. As a player, scoring runs came naturally but, after Lot took on the captaincy for the first time in 2005 when Clare Connor was injured, she faced a real test of her leadership - not winning a single game on a tour in India.</p>
