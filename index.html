        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year budget of €2 trillion, featuring a fivefold increase in defense and space investment to €131 billion. This plan, described by President Ursula von der Leyen as a budget for today's realities, also allocates 35% to climate projects and triples funding for migration management. The proposal, which must gain unanimous approval from member states, aims to generate new revenue streams to avoid increasing national contributions, though some nations have already criticized the proposed budget as being too high.

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged for stricter price monitoring and regulation within the nation's electric vehicle industry to control a fierce price war. This intense competition has contributed to deflationary pressures, with industrial profits falling significantly. Officials are now calling for automakers to focus on technological innovation rather than excessive price cuts, though economists caution that curbing oversupply without hindering economic growth and employment presents a significant challenge for Beijing.

          <p>This article shares the personal story of Marta, an undocumented street vendor in Los Angeles who has been living and working in constant fear since a wave of immigration raids began. She describes how the threat of deportation has profoundly affected her family and the broader immigrant community, forcing her to be hyper-vigilant while trying to earn a living. The fear has altered daily life, with fewer people on the streets and a pervasive sense of anxiety, forcing her family to create contingency plans in case she or her husband are arrested.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and missing economists' expectations for a rise. The decline was driven by sharp drops in shipments to major partners, including an 11.4% fall in exports to the U.S., as trade talks remain stalled and new tariffs loom. The sustained export weakness, particularly in the critical automotive sector, is intensifying fears that Japan's export-dependent economy could be heading toward a technical recession.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst," an analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data reveals that most deported individuals did not have violent criminal records. Of the roughly 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, and many infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. The data suggests a discrepancy between the administration's public messaging about targeting dangerous criminals and the actual records of those being removed from the country.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market disruption if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a move the president has not ruled out. Experts predict such an action would trigger a sharp equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields, creating a "dreadful" economic situation. The unprecedented move would likely lead to a legal battle over the president's authority, potentially reaching the Supreme Court, and would undermine the crucial independence of the central bank.
