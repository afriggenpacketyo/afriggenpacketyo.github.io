          <p>India is experiencing a significant rise in the world of chess, marked by major victories like the Chess Olympiad and the FIDE Women's World Cup. This success is largely attributed to a robust grassroots system, particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu, where a culture of dedicated training and strong parental support has created a "factory of Indian chess." The article notes that chess is increasingly seen as a viable career path, with government jobs and professional leagues providing financial stability. This shift from a niche hobby to a professional sport is fueling the nation's growing dominance on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Cleanup and recovery efforts are underway across Scotland following Storm Floris, which left thousands of homes without electricity and caused significant travel disruption. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is working to restore power to approximately 22,000 properties, describing the storm as the most damaging in recent memory for the summer season. Network Rail reported numerous incidents, primarily from fallen trees, but most train routes have since reopened after extensive clearing operations. The storm, which brought gusts up to 90mph, also led to canceled flights and ferry services, prompting an emergency government response.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County grand jury has declined to indict a former Atlanta police officer, Kiran Kimbrough, for the 2023 death of 62-year-old church deacon Johnny Hollman Sr. Hollman died after a struggle with the officer following a minor car accident, during which he was tased while repeatedly stating he couldn't breathe. The decision has been met with devastation from Hollman's family, who recently received a $3.8 million settlement from the city and continue to call for justice. The officer's attorney maintains that Hollman's death was caused by medical complications and his resistance, not the officer's actions.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly set to propose a full military reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet, according to Israeli media. This potential plan for a complete conquest of the territory and defeat of Hamas has sparked opposition from some military leaders and deep concern from the families of Israeli hostages, who fear for their safety. The proposal comes after ceasefire talks broke down and as international allies push for an end to the war to address the severe humanitarian crisis. Critics, including former Israeli security officials, argue further military action is futile and will not defeat Hamas's ideology.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The results were primarily dragged down by struggling performance in the United States, where both KFC and Pizza Hut saw same-store sales decline by 5%. While international performance helped KFC achieve modest global growth, its domestic struggles continue amid increased competition. Taco Bell remained a bright spot for the company, posting a 4% increase in same-store sales both globally and internationally. (not investment advice)</p>

Flood defended the legislation, arguing it provides a middle-class tax cut and implements work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients. Despite his efforts to explain his vote, the event concluded with audience members shouting, "vote him out!"</p>

While many scientists agree that nuclear power is the most viable option for a continuous energy source on the Moon, concerns remain about the ambitious timeline, recent NASA budget cuts, and the geopolitical motivations driving the project. The plan calls for a reactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts of power.</p>

It contrasts this case with others where a clear motive or even a physiological cause, like a brain tumor, was present, questioning whether understanding the 'why' changes our perception of the crime. The author argues that labeling acts as simply "evil" can be a way to avoid confronting the complex roots of human violence.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Terminating Two Key NASA Climate Satellite Missions</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to develop plans to terminate two major satellite missions responsible for measuring carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. These missions, which cost about $15 million annually to maintain, provide crucial data used by scientists, agricultural sectors, and energy companies to track greenhouse gases. One satellite would be deorbited and burned up in the atmosphere, while the other, attached to the International Space Station, would be shut down. This move aligns with the administration's broader efforts to scale back federal climate science and action, drawing concern from the scientific community.</p>

          <p>A massive mudslide and flash flooding, triggered by a cloudburst, have devastated a village in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, killing at least four people with more than 50 others feared missing. The Indian military and national disaster response teams have been deployed to the remote Himalayan region to conduct rescue operations, which are hampered by the difficult terrain. The state's chief minister has assured that efforts are being carried out "on a war footing" to save lives. This region is highly susceptible to such disasters during the monsoon season, a risk exacerbated by climate change and receding glaciers.</p>

          <p>Investigators in the Mexican state of Guanajuato have confirmed that dismembered human remains found in an abandoned house belong to 32 different victims. The gruesome discovery was made in the city of Irapuato during a search for missing persons, and so far, 15 individuals have been identified. Guanajuato is Mexico's deadliest state due to violent turf wars between rival drug cartels, such as the Jalisco New Generation cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima gang. These groups frequently use clandestine graves to dispose of their victims, contributing to the country's staggering number of nearly 132,000 disappeared persons.</p>

          <p>According to sources close to the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to adhere to an ultimatum from U.S. President Donald Trump demanding a ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump has threatened new sanctions and massive tariffs if Russia does not comply. However, Putin reportedly believes Russia is winning the war and remains focused on his goal of capturing four Ukrainian regions in their entirety. While Putin is said to be concerned about deteriorating U.S. relations, he views his war objectives as the top priority and is skeptical that further sanctions will have a significant impact on Russia's capabilities.</p>

Credit has started flowing to developers again, and the inventory of unsold homes has decreased, leading Fitch Ratings to revise its forecast for new home sales from a 15% decline to a more moderate 7% drop. The consolidation of the market, with state-owned developers increasing their market share, has also been a key factor in stabilizing the sector.

          <p>As global tensions rise, the decades-old debate over the feasibility of a "limited" nuclear war is re-emerging among strategic thinkers. While world leaders have long affirmed that a nuclear war cannot be won, the military doctrines and weapons development of major powers suggest they are preparing for such a contingency. Proponents argue that planning for limited nuclear conflict is necessary to deter aggression from adversaries like Russia and China. However, critics warn that the belief in a controllable nuclear exchange is a dangerous fantasy that makes escalation to a catastrophic, civilization-ending war more likely.</p>
