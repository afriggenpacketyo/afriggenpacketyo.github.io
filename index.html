          <p>As of early August 2025, the price of gold stands at approximately $3,371 per ounce. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, particularly during economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Its value is influenced by several key factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, and central bank policies. The article notes that while gold has historically held its value, its price is subject to constant short-term fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has announced that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to meet in the coming days. This development follows Trump's statement about the 'good chance' of a trilateral summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. While Zelensky has shown support for such talks, Putin has indicated that conditions for a meeting with him are not yet met. The potential summit is set against the backdrop of a U.S. deadline for a ceasefire, after which more sanctions on Russia could be imposed.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly set to visit China for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first trip to the country in seven years. This potential visit signifies a thaw in relations between the two nations, which have been strained since a deadly border clash in 2020. The move comes as India's relationship with the United States faces growing trade tensions, including newly announced U.S. tariffs. This has led to speculation that New Delhi may be recalibrating its foreign policy approach towards Beijing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Intel fell after President Donald Trump demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing concerns over his ties to Chinese companies. The call for resignation followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton questioning Tan's associations and their potential impact on U.S. national security, given Intel's role in the domestic chip industry. Tan, who took over in March, has been leading a strategic reset at Intel, including cost-cutting measures and canceling some factory projects to navigate declining sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has declared that the FBI would be unwelcome in his state if they attempted to pursue Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled to avoid a redistricting vote. Pritzker argued that the lawmakers have not broken any federal laws, rendering any FBI involvement illegitimate political 'grandstanding.' The situation arose after Texas Republicans sought federal help to locate the absent Democrats to establish a quorum for a special legislative session. The move is part of a larger political battle over congressional redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to begin work on a new census that would, for the first time, exclude people living in the U.S. without legal status from apportionment counts. This move revives a contentious effort from his first term that faced significant legal challenges and was ultimately blocked by the Supreme Court regarding a citizenship question. The 14th Amendment has been historically interpreted to require counting the 'whole number of persons in each state' for redistributing congressional seats, making the legality of this new directive highly questionable and likely to face immediate lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter earnings were significantly boosted by the strong performance of its film studios, with hits like 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'F1' contributing to a 55% increase in segment revenue. Theatrical revenue saw a 38% rise, and the company projects continued momentum, partly due to the recent success of 'Superman.' CEO David Zaslav highlighted the studio's turnaround, crediting new leadership and a focus on major franchises like 'Lord of the Rings' and DC properties. This success comes as the company continues to restructure and prepares to split into two separate units next year.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its key interest rate to 4%, a move that will have varied effects on household finances. For homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, this will likely lead to lower monthly repayments, though those on fixed rates will see no immediate change. Conversely, savers will face reduced returns on their deposits as savings rates are expected to fall further. The central bank's decision aims to stimulate the economy, but it comes at a time when inflation is forecast to rise, potentially eroding the real-term value of savings.</p>

          <p>A recent tragedy where at least 92 people drowned highlights the extreme dangers of the 'Eastern Route' for migrants crossing the Bab al-Mandab Strait from Djibouti to Yemen. Despite the risks, including overloaded boats, rough seas, and smugglers' brutality, the number of migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, is increasing. They are fleeing economic crises and conflict, hoping to reach wealthy Gulf states. The strait is a busy shipping lane with no formal sea rescue program, and commercial ships are often hesitant to help due to piracy fears, leaving migrants with little chance of survival if their vessels sink.</p>

          <p>Despite plans for a meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin, a swift resolution to the war in Ukraine remains unlikely due to the vast gulf between Moscow's and Kyiv's positions. Russia's demands for a 'final settlement' are maximalist, including sovereignty over five Ukrainian regions and Ukraine's demilitarization, which are unacceptable to Kyiv. Analysts suggest Putin may be engaging in dialogue to fend off further U.S. sanctions or to persuade Trump of his position. Ukrainian officials are concerned that without their participation, Trump might concede to Putin's terms, making their involvement in any talks critical.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the profound and often overlooked experience of sibling loss, reflecting on the death of the author's 18-year-old brother in a car accident 33 years ago. The author discusses the concept of 'disenfranchised grief,' where the sorrow of a surviving sibling is not fully acknowledged by society. The piece delves into the complex nature of sibling relationships, the loss of a shared past and future, and the struggle to define one's identity after a sibling dies. It highlights how the absence of a sibling shapes a person's life as much as their presence once did.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans. This move could open the door for investments like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate within these popular defined-contribution plans. The alternative asset industry has long pushed for this change, which could unlock a significant new market. Traditionally, these assets have been excluded from 401(k)s due to higher risks, fees, and lack of transparency compared to conventional investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The man accused of killing Minnesota's top House Democrat, Melissa Hortman, and her husband is expected to enter a not-guilty plea at his federal court arraignment. The suspect, Vance Boelter, was indicted on multiple counts of murder and stalking for the June shootings, which also wounded a state senator and his wife. In a handwritten letter to the FBI, Boelter reportedly confessed but his motive remains unclear, though he had created lists of politicians. Prosecutors consider the killing a 'political assassination' and are months away from deciding whether to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>A sweeping set of new U.S. tariffs, impacting more than 90 countries, has now come into effect, marking a significant escalation in President Trump's trade policies. These import taxes are part of Trump's strategy to reshape global trade and encourage domestic manufacturing. The tariffs vary by country, with some Southeast Asian nations facing levies as high as 40%, while allies like the UK and Japan have negotiated lower rates. The move follows other recent tariff threats, including a potential 50% rate on India and 100% on foreign-made semiconductors, creating widespread uncertainty in the global economy.

While it initially attracted 40 of America's richest, the percentage of U.S. billionaires who have signed on has since declined. A report from the Institute for Policy Studies notes that the rapid growth of wealth has made it difficult for some pledgers to give away their money fast enough.

          <p>A new law, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' threatens to destabilize children's health care by altering Medicaid financing to offset tax cuts, according to this analysis. While not directly targeting children, the law's nationwide work requirements and funding changes are predicted to cause millions of adults to lose coverage, which will have a cascade effect on their children. Experts warn this will lead to more uninsured children, cuts to in-home care for those with disabilities, and increased strain on an already fragile pediatric hospital system. The changes could endanger the most vulnerable sectors of the U.S. health-care system.</p>

          <p>The starvation occurring in Gaza is being described by experts as a uniquely deliberate and systematic act, distinguishing it from other historical famines. From the war's outset, Israeli officials announced a 'complete siege,' and the subsequent blocking of humanitarian aid has been sustained and well-documented. Unlike famines caused by climate or market failures, the situation in Gaza is entirely man-made, as Israel has the capacity to allow aid in at any moment. The use of starvation as a weapon of war is a war crime, and the rigor and defiance of international humanitarian capacity make Israel's actions in Gaza stand apart.</p>
