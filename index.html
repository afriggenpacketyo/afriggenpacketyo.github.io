        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, publicly expressed doubt that diplomatic talks with the United States could restart quickly, despite recent indications from President Trump. Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a subsequent 12-day conflict with Israel, Araghchi emphasized that Iran first needs concrete assurances that America will not launch further military attacks during any future negotiations. While he stressed that more time is needed to consider re-engagement, he also insisted that the "doors of diplomacy will never slam shut," leaving a potential, albeit narrow, path for future dialogue. The White House has confirmed that no talks are officially scheduled at this time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer suggests that younger investors are fundamentally reshaping market dynamics by prioritizing companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas over established corporations focused on stock buybacks. He argues this has fostered an "idea market," where narrative and growth potential drive valuations for companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash, which are seen as having immense future earnings potential through innovative financial engineering or advertising models. According to Cramer, these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policies, focusing instead on individual stocks that tell a compelling story, thus rewarding what he calls "bold behavior" in the corporate world.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health concludes that logistical barriers, not vaccine hesitancy, are the primary reason for declining childhood vaccination rates. Parents are reportedly struggling with practical issues such as difficulty booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear information or reminders about their child's immunization schedule. This decline has contributed to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles, with no UK childhood vaccine meeting the 95% WHO target since 2022. The report urgently recommends systemic improvements, including better digital booking systems and more investment in community health services to reverse the concerning trend.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s approach to public health, which has drawn both praise and intense criticism. He is targeting the food industry to eliminate additives and promoting healthier eating, an initiative some experts see as positive but lacking focus on systemic issues like poverty. Simultaneously, his long-standing skepticism towards vaccines has led to significant changes at the CDC, including dismantling an advisory panel and launching new research into a discredited vaccine-autism link. The piece explores the tension between his ambitious goals to tackle chronic disease and his promotion of scientifically unsupported theories, creating a divisive public health landscape.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported that the company has not observed appreciable price hikes for consumers despite new U.S. tariffs on imports. He attributed this stability to proactive strategies, such as forward-buying inventory by both Amazon and its third-party sellers before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace, with its millions of sellers, helps suppress prices as some vendors will absorb costs to gain market share. He further discussed the transformative impact of generative AI, predicting it will enhance employee roles and lead to widespread consumer adoption of home robots within a decade.

The long-term outlook remains clouded by geopolitical uncertainty, which could impact wholesale prices and future household bills. The article notes that families are adapting with budgeting strategies like bulk cooking and using energy-efficient appliances, as regulators urge consumers to consider fixed-rate deals for more payment stability.</p>

The motive for the attack remains unknown, and investigators are examining Roley's vehicle and social media for clues.

The proposed legislation would impose a new tax on renewable energy projects that source components from China and would abruptly phase out key tax credits for wind and solar projects after 2027. Industry trade groups warn these changes could add a $4 billion to $7 billion tax burden, jeopardize hundreds of thousands of construction jobs, and potentially raise electricity prices for consumers.

In a series of posts on his social media platform, Musk sharply criticized the bill for its high spending levels and a provision to raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. He also revived the idea of creating a new political party, the "America Party," if the legislation passes. This public criticism marks a renewed political engagement from Musk, who had previously indicated he would reduce his political spending after heavily supporting Republican candidates.</p>

This move to reshore production of washers and dryers will allow the company to avoid paying stiffer import tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. The new plant is expected to be fully operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments regarding the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798, to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU, representing the migrants, argued that the act was intended only for major, declared wars, not for conflicts with criminal gangs. The judges appeared focused on whether they have the jurisdictional authority to overrule a president's invocation of the act. The Justice Department defended the move, claiming the gang constitutes a "predatory incursion" and citing FBI intelligence that it poses a significant threat of violence within the U.S.</p>

          <p>London's privy council, the final court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld the British overseas territory's Civil Partnership Law, securing legal recognition for same-sex couples. The ruling rejected a challenge that argued the governor overstepped his authority by enacting the law in 2020 after local lawmakers had voted it down. The law was originally introduced following a court case by a lesbian couple, which established that same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections functionally equivalent to marriage. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners have hailed the decision as a significant victory that could set a precedent for other British overseas territories.</p>

A suspect, now identified as Wess Roley, allegedly started the fire to lure first responders and then opened fire, killing two and wounding another before apparently taking his own life. The incident has horrified residents and officials, with Governor Brad Little calling the attack an "indescribable loss" and stating "this is not Idaho."

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has officially removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," which now allows guild members to work with him again. This resolution came after Emmett paid over $630,000 to settle a long-standing judgment related to unpaid compensation and health benefits for four writers on a proposed TV show from 2019. The debt was originally tied to his defunct firm, Emmett/Furla Oasis, but Emmett stated he made the personal decision to pay it because it was the right thing to do.

          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet triggered a significant surge in U.S. inflation, keeping consumer prices relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term mitigation strategies employed by businesses, such as aggressively front-loading inventory before the tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing costs to avoid alienating consumers, and utilizing legal mechanisms like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While these tactics have buffered the initial shock, experts caution that prices could still rise in the latter half of the year as these temporary measures are exhausted and the full impact of the trade policies is felt.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the Senate version would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion and leave an additional 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. Key provisions include new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for many recipients, which experts say could disproportionately affect older adults who face barriers to employment.

The BBC, which had been focused on a potential controversy with another band, has expressed regret for not pulling the live stream sooner and is reviewing its guidance for live events.</p>

          <h2>Republican Spending Bill Poses Significant Threats to Reproductive Healthcare Access</h2>

          <p>The Republican "big, beautiful bill" contains multiple provisions that would severely erode access to abortion and other reproductive care in the United States. The legislation aims to defund Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers for at least a decade, which could force the closure of nearly 200 clinics nationwide. It would also incentivize insurers to drop abortion coverage from ACA marketplace plans and make deep cuts to Medicaid, affecting access to a wide range of health services for low-income people. These measures come three years after the overturning of Roe v. Wade and represent a significant federal effort to restrict reproductive rights across the country.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Demands Clarity on Enforcement of Birthright Citizenship Executive Order</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to clarify how it will enforce an executive order aimed at denying citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. The order came after the Supreme Court partially stayed nationwide injunctions against the policy, creating significant confusion and fear among immigrant families. The judge specifically pressed the government on whether it plans to deport babies subject to the executive order while legal challenges are ongoing. A Justice Department attorney stated that government agencies are still developing implementation guidelines and that there are no immediate plans to do so.</p>
