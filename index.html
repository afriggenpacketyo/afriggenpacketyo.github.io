          <p>A significant portion of the funding for President Trump's second-term agenda is expected to come from cuts to safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP. The proposed bill includes substantial cuts to Medicaid, potentially causing millions to lose coverage, and significant reductions to SNAP funding. Republicans argue these cuts aim to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, freeing up funds for tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense. The bill includes work requirements, increased eligibility checks, and restrictions on coverage for undocumented migrants.</p>

Six firms are banned from paying bonuses this year including Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. The ban, which is backdated to April 2024, means regulator Ofwat can force firms to claw back bonuses that have been paid or face enforcement action.</p>
