          <p>Three elderly nuns in Austria, aged in their 80s, have defied church authorities by leaving their assigned care home and returning to their former convent near Salzburg. The nuns, who had spent most of their lives at the Kloster Goldenstein convent, stated they were moved against their will after the community was dissolved. With the help of former students, they regained access to their old apartments, sparking a dispute with church officials who cite health and safety concerns for their relocation. The nuns are now receiving support from the local community and are determined to remain in their lifelong home.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed a man in Franklin Park, Illinois, during a vehicle stop. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the man, identified as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, resisted arrest and attempted to drive his vehicle into the agents, striking and dragging one officer. The agent, fearing for his life, discharged his firearm, fatally wounding Villegas-Gonzalez, who later died at a hospital. The incident has prompted calls for a full investigation from local politicians, with questions raised about the necessity of the force used during the encounter.</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk who was assassinated at a university event, delivered her first public remarks following her husband's death. Her address was streamed on the social media platforms of Turning Point USA, the influential youth activist organization founded by her late husband. The shooting, described as a "political assassination," has sent shockwaves through the political landscape and prompted an outpouring of sympathy for his family. Erika Kirk, a former Miss Arizona USA and founder of several organizations, has been a frequent presence alongside her husband at public events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, artificial intelligence tools significantly contributed to the rapid spread of false claims and conspiracy theories online. A CBS News analysis found that X's AI chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect before an official announcement was made and generated altered images of the individual sought by the FBI. Other AI systems also produced inaccurate information, highlighting the challenge generative AI faces in providing factual, real-time information during breaking news events. Experts note that people may perceive AI as more reliable than human sources, compounding the problem of misinformation.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian businessman in Tulkarm, in the occupied West Bank, alleges that the Israeli military commandeered his family's multi-story property for over three months before setting it on fire. Nasser Faratawi claims his home and business were used as a base for an operation in a nearby refugee camp, resulting in extensive destruction, vandalism, and financial ruin estimated at $700,000. The Israeli military stated it was "not aware of any arson committed by its troops" and that a complaint is under review. The incident highlights the escalating tensions and frequent use of Palestinian homes by Israeli forces in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>A new report from Policy in Practice indicates that seven million households across the UK are failing to claim a total of £24 billion in benefits and other financial support to which they are entitled. The analysis identifies lack of awareness, the complexity of the application process, and social stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from accessing aid such as universal credit and council tax support. While some progress has been made in increasing uptake for certain benefits like pension credit, the overall amount of unclaimed support is rising. The government stated it runs campaigns to promote benefits.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of Tyler Robinson for the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk, a legal analyst has called for further investigation into potential co-conspirators. The analyst, Phil Holloway, pointed to reports that Robinson communicated with others on the Discord app about the attack and was provided with the rifle, suggesting a conspiracy. He argues that anyone who knew of the plan or provided encouragement or material support could be criminally liable. As of Friday, Utah officials stated that no additional arrests were expected, though they are investigating how the suspect obtained the weapon used in the shooting.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

Investigators have recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used, along with bullet casings bearing bizarre, trollish inscriptions.

In one incident, a boat carrying nearly 500 passengers capsized on the Congo River after catching fire, leaving 146 people missing. In another accident a day earlier, a different overloaded vessel capsized, killing at least 86 people, most of whom were students.

This article argues that the internet's algorithmic nature rewards rage and certainty, turning tragedies into opportunities for political point-scoring and narrative-fitting. The shooter's own apparent immersion in hyper-online, nihilistic troll culture, evidenced by inscriptions on bullet casings, reflects a disturbing trend of violence performed for a digital audience. This dynamic creates a vicious cycle where senseless violence is amplified by a system that prioritizes engagement over truth or reconciliation.</p>

The agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, argues the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is unnecessary "red tape" that does not materially improve health or the environment, and its removal would save businesses billions. Environmental experts and former EPA officials counter that ending the program would blind the public and policymakers to crucial data about climate pollution from sources like power plants and refineries.

However, the review suggests that the premise of the band now being revered, featuring cameos from Paul McCartney and Elton John, undermines the outsider comedy that made the original a classic.

          <p>The science fiction concept of a universal translator is moving closer to reality as major tech companies invest heavily in real-time language translation. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods, allowing for near-instantaneous audio translation between languages like Spanish and English. This development places Apple in direct competition with Google, which has a similar feature for its Pixel phones that preserves a speaker's voice, and Meta, which is integrating translation into its smart glasses. These advancements in generative AI are poised to break down language barriers and reshape global communication.</p>

Instructors and participants note that classes are now filled with teenagers and young adults, a dramatic shift from the dance style's previous association with older demographics. The modern take on line dancing is also more diverse, incorporating routines set to a wide range of musical genres beyond traditional country, making it an accessible and social form of exercise.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Utah Governor Spencer Cox has emerged as a voice of conciliation, a stark contrast to the inflammatory rhetoric from President Donald Trump and other conservative figures. While Trump immediately blamed "radical-left lunatics," Cox urged the public to reject rage, get offline, and hold only the perpetrator responsible. This article highlights the governor's consistent efforts to lower the political temperature, even as the dominant response within his party has been to escalate partisan division. The two responses showcase the rival impulses within the GOP, with Cox's plea for unity largely being overshadowed.</p>

          <p>A recent academic seminar in Hong Kong presented one of the first comprehensive assessments of the economic effects of U.S. sanctions on China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Since 2019, and escalating with the 2021 Uygur Forced Labor Protection Act, the U.S. has placed 144 Chinese companies on an entity list over alleged human rights abuses, effectively barring them from the American market. These sanctions target key sectors such as apparel, electronics, and critical minerals. Beijing has consistently denied the allegations of abuse and claims the U.S. sanctions are designed to undermine the region's economy.</p>

          <p>Paramount has publicly denounced a campaign by a group called Film Workers for Palestine that calls for a boycott of Israeli film institutions. The group's open letter, signed by prominent figures like Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone, pledges not to work with Israeli festivals or production companies, citing the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In response, Paramount became the first major studio to take a position, stating that silencing artists based on nationality does not advance peace and that more engagement is needed, not less. The move highlights the deep divisions within Hollywood over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article questions the immediate labeling of Charlie Kirk as a Christian martyr by many on the religious right following his assassination. The author argues that Kirk's public rhetoric, which often rejected empathy and promoted divisive views, stands in contrast to the traditional evangelical understanding of Jesus's teachings of love and compassion. The piece suggests that for his supporters, Kirk's martyrdom is tied to a political and religious vision of a nation led by white, Christian men. It contrasts this with the broader tragedy of gun violence, which creates many other overlooked victims and martyrs in the fight for safety.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, an anti-gun activist recounts a 2022 meeting with Senator Ted Cruz where she and other victims of gun violence pleaded for his support for a federal assault weapons ban. The author, who survived the Highland Park parade shooting with her son, describes Cruz's response as dismissive, as he instead advocated for more police in schools. This suggestion was particularly painful for the parents of a Uvalde victim who were present, given the delayed law enforcement response during that tragedy. The article argues that banning assault weapons is the only effective way to prevent mass shootings.</p>

Maresca stated that he has not seen either player since the season began, as they are using different facilities at a different time. This confirms their status in the so-called "bomb squad," indicating they are not part of the manager's plans for the foreseeable future at the club.</p>

However, the loan document from her credit union indicates she informed the lender of her intent to use the Atlanta property as a second home.

Lively's attorney accused Baldoni's team of trying to create a "media spectacle" by involving the high-profile singer.
