          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 intensifying into major hurricanes. This outlook is influenced by factors such as the neutral phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA emphasizes technological advancements for more accurate forecasts and urges communities in storm-prone areas to prepare proactively. The agency's forecasting model, HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade to increase storm tracking accuracy by about 5%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached record highs, with ground beef costing an average of $5.80 per pound in April, nearly a 50% increase from five years ago. Ranchers are facing higher costs for feed, land, and financing, leading to reduced cattle herds, which are at their lowest numbers in over 70 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025 as supplies tighten. Ranchers are trying to absorb some of the price increases, but ultimately, higher cattle prices will need to be passed on to consumers to maintain profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The skincare industry is under scrutiny for marketing products with anti-aging ingredients, such as retinols and vitamin C, to tweens through social media, potentially harming their young skin. Nielsen data indicates that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion on skincare and makeup in 2023, surpassing spending by households with teens. Dermatologists warn that these products can cause rashes and increase the risk of sunburns. Some lawmakers are considering legislation to restrict the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18, while brands are launching counter-marketing campaigns to educate kids about appropriate skincare.</p>

          <p>A White House report, spearheaded by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F.

The report, a product of the MAHA Commission, suggests that American children are the "sickest generation" in history. It advocates for increased research into the causes and prevention of diseases, while also pointing to corporate influence in federal policymaking.

The hearing ended inconclusively, with lawyers submitting closing arguments by June 2, after which the judge will rule.

Her creations, inspired by her grandfather, a bagel baker, became popular, leading to a family business and collaborations with companies like McGraw Hill and Hasbro.

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit federal judges' power to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The bill blocks judges from enforcing contempt citations if they haven't ordered a bond, a provision Republicans say will discourage frivolous lawsuits. Democrats argue the measure would rob courts of their power. The provision would apply retroactively, including to ongoing cases where judges are weighing contempt charges against Trump administration officials over deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump faced protests outside his Virginia golf course, where he hosted a private dinner for top investors in his cryptocurrency tokens, $TRUMP. Democrats denounced the dinner as corrupt, demanding Trump release guest names. The event, organized by Trump's business partners, allowed access to the president by purchasing $TRUMP, a cryptocurrency token launched before Trump's inauguration. Many guests have a stake in U.S. crypto regulations and viewed the dinner as an opportunity to influence policy. Critics argue the event directly enriches the Trump family.</p>

The bill proposes tightening eligibility requirements for SNAP, requiring more aid recipients to obtain work.

The bill also shifts some SNAP costs to states, potentially causing 1.3 million people to lose access as states modify benefits or leave the program.</p>
