          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to over seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Judge Joanna Seybert handed down the sentence, which includes two years of supervised release, after Santos expressed regret for defrauding voters. Prosecutors had requested the maximum sentence, citing his "brazen web of deceit," while Santos asked for a shorter term. He was convicted of falsifying Federal Election Commission filings and inflating fundraising totals. </p>

          <p>Online scammers are increasingly using "wrong number" text messages, often aided by AI, to trick users into providing personal information and financial account access. These seemingly harmless messages are used to validate active mobile numbers and build relationships, often leading to 'pig butchering' scams where victims lose significant amounts of money. Consumers lost $470 million to scams that started with text messages in 2024. Psychologists note that loneliness and the need for connection can make people more vulnerable to these scams, emphasizing the importance of ignoring and reporting suspicious texts.</p>

          <p>Liverpool will introduce a £2 'tourist tax' for overnight stays after a majority of hoteliers voted in favor of the plan. The levy, called the City Visitor Charge, is expected to generate £9.2 million over two years, with £6.7 million allocated to supporting the city's visitor economy. Liverpool BID Company believes the charge will boost tourism and attract larger events. Visitors have expressed that the small fee would not deter them from staying in Liverpool, viewing it as a reasonable contribution to the city's upkeep.</p>

India announced the suspension of a decades-old water treaty with Pakistan, while Pakistan has warned that any move by India to hold back water would be considered an "act of war."
