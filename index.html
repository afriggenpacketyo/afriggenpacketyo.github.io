          <p>Experts in radiation hazards suggest that a U.S. 'bunker buster' bomb strike on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant would likely result in localized contamination. Emily Caffrey notes that the uranium hexafluoride gas used at the site is heavy and wouldn't travel far, posing minimal risk to those outside the immediate area. Edwin Lyman adds that the uranium isotopes present are at the lower end of hazard regarding radioactive materials. The IAEA has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iran's facilities, reporting that radioactivity levels outside the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant remained normal after an attack, though there was radiological and chemical contamination inside.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials showed the drug to be highly effective, with 99.9% of participants remaining HIV negative. Gilead's CEO, Daniel O'Day, hailed the approval as a major milestone in the fight against HIV, suggesting it could help end the epidemic. However, some experts warn that the Trump administration's recent decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research could hinder further progress, with one immunology professor warning that research could be set back a decade.</p>

While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, mirroring its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and low inflation, but acknowledged that the Trump administration's tariffs could drive up inflation and slow growth.

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in a retrial, but was found guilty of operating under the influence of liquor. The jury acquitted her of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. The defense argued that Read's vehicle did not hit O'Keefe and that he was attacked by others. The verdict was met with cheers from Read's supporters outside the courthouse, while some witnesses expressed disappointment, calling the result a miscarriage of justice.</p>

They raise concerns that agencies may sidestep their responsibility to demonstrate substantive safety concerns, leading to unnecessary and costly mandates.

Medical experts warn this could disproportionately affect female and LGBTQ+ veterans, as well as those in rural areas. The VA maintains that all eligible veterans will receive care, but critics argue the changes open the door to discrimination.</p>
