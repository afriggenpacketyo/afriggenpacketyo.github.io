          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is preparing to seek federal hate crime charges and the death penalty against Elias Rodriguez, the man accused of killing two Israeli Embassy employees in May. A grand jury is expected to hear evidence for an indictment that would include special findings for capital punishment. Rodriguez is already facing first-degree murder charges for the deaths of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum. Following the shooting, Rodriguez allegedly told authorities, "I did it for Palestine," prompting an investigation into the attack as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay for "The Players' Tribune," Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love revealed that he nearly quit football at age 14 following his father's suicide. Love wrote that he was small for his age and a backup player, and the grief made him want to stop playing entirely. However, his mother encouraged him to continue for just one more year, a decision he credits with saving him. He explained that the camaraderie of the team provided an escape from a dark period and that he would not be where he is today without the support of his family and the brotherhood of football.</p>

          <p>A law firm is calling for a federal investigation into Los Angeles County's juvenile detention facilities and foster homes, describing the situation as "essentially Epstein Island" due to rampant sexual abuse. This comes after the county agreed to a $4 billion settlement for approximately 7,000 abuse cases, yet no one has faced criminal charges. The firm, which is not part of the settlement, argues that a federal probe is necessary to establish accountability for the systemic failures and alleged human trafficking of vulnerable children by county probation officers. The U.S. Attorney's Office has declined to comment on the request for an investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he views Vice President JD Vance as the most likely person to succeed him as the leader of the MAGA movement and a probable frontrunner for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination. While stating it was early to discuss, Trump praised Vance's performance and suggested he would be favored at this point. The president also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio as another potential contender, hinting at a possible future collaboration between the two. Both Vance and Rubio, once critics of Trump, have since become staunch allies, though they have remained publicly coy about their future ambitions.</p>

          <p>James Arthur McDonald Jr., a former financial analyst and frequent CNBC guest, has been sentenced to five years in prison for a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme. McDonald's investment firm lost between $30 million and $40 million after a risky bet against the market failed in late 2020. He then solicited new funds from investors without disclosing these massive losses, misappropriating the money for personal expenses, including a Porsche and luxury rent. After failing to appear for an SEC testimony in 2021, he became a fugitive and was arrested in Washington state in June 2024.</p>

          <p>The Rwandan government has confirmed an agreement to accept up to 250 migrant deportees from the United States, retaining the right to approve each individual. This move aligns with President Trump's policy of sending deportees to third countries and follows similar agreements with South Sudan and Eswatini. The deal comes after the UK's own plan to send migrants to Rwanda was struck down by its Supreme Court, which deemed the country unsafe. Human rights activists have criticized the U.S. policy, warning it could violate international law by placing migrants at risk in other nations.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued a bipartisan subpoena to the Department of Justice, demanding all records related to its investigations of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The move signals a potential conflict between Congress and the White House over the handling of the case, as President Trump has faced pressure for more transparency. The committee also subpoenaed several former high-ranking officials for depositions, including former presidents and FBI directors. This action occurs as the administration seeks to release grand jury testimony from the Maxwell trial, a move her lawyers are currently opposing in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has accused major banks of discriminating against conservatives through "debanking," the practice of closing customer accounts. He claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America had unfairly targeted him and others for their political views. The issue has become a rallying point for some conservatives, though banking leaders like Bank of America's CEO maintain that account closure decisions are based on risk management and regulatory requirements, not political bias. While federal data shows thousands of complaints about improper account closures, there is no specific data tracking closures based on political affiliation.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, despite a legal battle over his implanted heart defibrillator. His attorneys had argued that the lethal injection could trigger the device, causing unnecessary pain, and sought to have it deactivated, but the state's Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to do so. Black, who was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two daughters, had multiple health issues, including dementia and congestive heart failure. His lawyer condemned the execution as the "brutal and unchecked abuse of government power" against a fragile, intellectually disabled man.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight Management Board responsible for managing Puerto Rico's budget and debt crisis. The dismissed members, including the chairman, were largely appointed by Democratic presidents.

The board was created by the PROMESA Act in 2016 to guide the U.S. territory toward fiscal stability, but it has faced criticism amid ongoing legal battles over the island's massive debt, particularly that of its electric power authority.</p>

          <p>A new Realtor.com report reveals a divided U.S. housing market, with home prices falling in some regions while rising in others. Cities in the South and West, such as Austin and Miami, have seen significant price drops from their 2022 peaks, driven by an increase in housing inventory. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest, like Milwaukee and New York, are experiencing rising prices due to persistently low inventory and fewer new constructions. This regional divergence means that homebuyers and sellers are facing vastly different market conditions depending on their location. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is preparing for a prolonged heat wave that threatens to intensify several large wildfires already burning across the state and increase fire danger in other areas. The Gifford fire, now the state's largest of the year at 82,000 acres, continues to burn with low containment, alongside the Rosa and Gold fires in Southern California. Forecasters predict triple-digit temperatures for many inland areas, which will dry out vegetation and create hazardous conditions. Officials warn that the combination of dry fuel, high heat, and low humidity could allow fires to grow uncontrollably.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the dominant figure in Romania's transition from communism to democracy, has died at the age of 95. Iliescu rose to power during the violent 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and served as the country's first democratically elected president. His legacy is deeply divisive; he is credited with steering Romania toward NATO and the EU, but also criticized for his role in the violent suppression of protests in the 1990s and for a reluctance to fully break from the country's communist past. His life embodied the complex and often painful struggles of post-Soviet Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic examines President Trump's persistent claim of a "Russia hoax," a term he uses with varying definitions. The piece contrasts the claim with the undisputed findings from the U.S. intelligence community and a GOP-led Senate investigation, which concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. It details how the "hoax" narrative has been bolstered by the debunking of wilder rumors and a misrepresentation of the Mueller report. The article argues that recent efforts by Trump's allies to push new versions of the claim are themselves a form of disinformation.</p>

Investigators blamed the company's late CEO, Stockton Rush, for ignoring warnings about hull damage and creating an environment where safety concerns were dismissed.

While the House Speaker has signed civil arrest warrants, state authorities have no jurisdiction to arrest the lawmakers out of state.
