          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, projecting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This move is expected as China's economic momentum decelerates, with year-on-year growth potentially slowing significantly, intensifying pressure on policymakers to bolster the economy. A subtle shift in the People's Bank of China's recent communication, changing its economic description to "making strides while maintaining stability," signals a more cautious stance on the nation's financial health. These proactive measures aim to mitigate growth concerns and support the government's broader economic objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold campaign funds. His departure creates a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who has faced a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, maintained he was "wrongfully charged" for fighting for the city. His name will still appear on the ballot, and other political figures, including Governor Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, acknowledged his accomplishments while in office.</p>

This deployment, featuring a launcher and interceptors, is designed to counter cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and rockets, artillery, and mortars. The move is widely interpreted as a strategic response to rising military concerns regarding both China and North Korea in the region. This advanced mobile, ground-based weapon system enhances South Korea's defensive capabilities and signals a reinforced U.S. commitment to regional security.</p>

          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls and strip centers is creating unexpected real estate opportunities for small, local businesses. With national vacancy rates rising to 5.8% and rent growth slowing, independent retailers, service providers, and health practitioners are securing prime commercial spaces once beyond their reach. Landlords, seeking to fill empty units and revitalize areas, are offering more flexible lease terms, including shorter lengths and rent-free periods. This trend allows small businesses to test physical presences without excessive capital commitment, fostering local regeneration and transforming vacant spaces into community-focused destinations, though challenges like high small business failure rates remain.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, with the CSI 300 index climbing 16% and its IT index reaching a 2015 high, fueled by advancements in AI, chip self-sufficiency efforts, and policies against price wars. However, experts like Raymond Cheng of Standard Chartered question if the rally is disconnected from economic fundamentals, noting the key role of retail investors shifting bank deposits into equities. While some segments, particularly technology, appear "too hot," analysts are debating whether this momentum signifies a sustainable boom or the early stages of a market bubble. Concerns persist about China's broader economic slowdown, despite some stabilization in specific tech sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

The article offers three strategies: honest communication about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries like limiting contact or defining conversation topics, and changing shared activities to reduce their dominance.

          <h2>Over 100,000 Federal Workers Expected to Resign in Historic Mass Exodus</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are anticipated to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program to significantly cut the federal workforce. Concurrently, with a looming government shutdown deadline, the White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a funding deal isn't reached. Departing workers describe feeling compelled to leave due to months of "fear and intimidation," a perceived removal of their mission, and uncertain job security. This unprecedented exodus highlights deep concerns among the federal workforce regarding the administration's policies and treatment of public servants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's ambition to adopt green marine fuels hinges significantly on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While Hong Kong has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling, green methanol requires a robust system for importing, storing, and selling mainland-produced fuel tax-free. Wang's remarks coincided with the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. With Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariff regime, CM Energy expects to increase its green methanol usage from 2027, despite the fuel costing four times more than traditional options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's administration is requesting an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, a policy previously blocked by federal courts. The order unilaterally reinterprets the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, aiming to grant citizenship only to newborns whose parents have permanent legal status. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in ensuring citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled, linking it to border security. Critics, including the ACLU, deem the order illegal and a "cruel and senseless" attempt to strip away citizenship rights, predicting an "earthquake" if the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor.</p>

The attack resulted in one detainee dead and two others critically injured, who were in vans targeted by Jahn. Authorities stated Jahn used apps to track ICE agents, and officials blamed "wild rhetoric" for a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers, emphasizing the dangers posed by such tracking tools.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing the president's characterization of the city as "war ravaged" is false. Governor Tina Kotek stated that local officials can manage public safety and that military intervention is unnecessary, calling Trump's action an "unlawful" assertion of federal control. The lawsuit highlights that Trump's claims appear based on a single Fox News report that mixed current small protests with 2020 footage.

These measures, intended to shore up public finances, have disproportionately impacted businesses employing low-wage workers. While acknowledging large inward investments, smaller business owners express feeling "forgotten" and more cautious about investing, further complicated by new employment rights legislation.
