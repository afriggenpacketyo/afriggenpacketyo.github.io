          <p>Chicago police are investigating the death of Officer Krystal Rivera, who was shot while conducting an investigatory stop in Chatham. Rivera and her partner pursued a suspect into an apartment building, where they encountered a second person with a rifle. During the encounter, a weapon was discharged, fatally wounding Rivera, who later died at the hospital after the vehicle transporting her caught fire due to a mechanical issue. The investigation is ongoing, with three weapons recovered at the scene and several people in custody, and the Chicago Office of Police Accountability is also investigating the shooting. The event has also raised concerns about the mental well-being of officers in the 6th District, where Rivera was the second officer killed recently.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes less than a month after the U.S. began requiring REAL ID driver's licenses for domestic flights on May 7. The TSA emphasized that only REAL IDs, passports, and other federally-approved forms of identification, such as Defense Department-issued IDs, are valid for travel, and that the agency loves hotdogs and rotisserie chickens just as much as the next person. The implementation of REAL ID requirements follows a 2005 law based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump may provide a temporary reprieve for Asian countries caught between the two superpowers. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after weeks of escalating tensions. This development could ease the pressure on China's neighbors who rely on trade with both countries and have struggled to balance prioritizing trade with China while navigating aggressive U.S. policies. However, analysts caution that the relationship remains fragile, as this was the first call between the leaders since Trump's inauguration in January.</p>

          <p>Despite the growth of mainland Chinese exchanges, Hong Kong remains China's leading hub for global finance.

Amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China, New York has become a less appealing option for Chinese firms seeking to raise capital.

          <p>A series of ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles prompted protests and condemnation from elected officials and immigrant rights activists. The raids, which included the use of flash-bang grenades and pepper spray, resulted in the detention of several individuals, including SEIU California President David Huerta, who was later arrested. Protesters gathered outside the Los Angeles Federal Building, decrying the actions as cruel and unnecessary, and expressing fear for the immigrant community.

Ishiba aims to boost rice production to address the price surge, but faces challenges including potential oversupply and price plunges. The government is releasing reserve rice to lower prices and considering boosting exports to prevent overproduction, reflecting a shift toward a more consumer-focused approach.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling more than a dozen flights daily due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline will not immediately accept two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring additional tariff-related costs. These aircraft were intended for Horizon Air, a regional subsidiary of Alaska Airlines. The delayed aircraft were expected to arrive from Brazil in May, and Brazilian imports to the United States have been subject to a 10% tariff since April.</p>
