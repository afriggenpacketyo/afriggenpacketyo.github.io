          <p>Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash, except for London, where the option is under review, following successful trials in several cities. The move aims to make Uber accessible to more people, including those who prefer cash or do not have a bank card. Drivers can opt out of accepting cash payments if they choose. The expansion comes amid discussions about the importance of cash in protecting vulnerable individuals, with calls for mandated cash acceptance in shops and services. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) workers, reversing an earlier ruling that had granted a temporary stay on Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order dismantling the US taxpayer-funded news service. The court panel determined that the courts should defer to the executive branch on employment matters, effectively halting VoA's broadcasting operations until the case is resolved. The ruling also maintains the freeze on congressionally approved funds for other publicly funded broadcasters, impacting their staffing and content production.</p>

          <p>Reform performed well in recent local council elections, securing the most votes and seats, indicating a significant shift in the political landscape. The party's success is attributed to its appeal among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019, suggesting a deeper connection than a mere protest vote. Reform's support is concentrated in areas characterized as 'left-behind' Britain, where globalization and university expansion have had less impact, and conservative views on immigration are more prevalent. The article notes that both the Conservatives and Labour face challenges in appealing to this demographic, as Reform gained seats from both parties.</p>

          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending an accredited private school with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation hurts public schools and primarily benefits wealthier students already in private schools. President Trump has supported the bill, and Gov. Abbott says it would not have been possible without the fearless commitment of the members of the House and Senate who put families first.</p>
