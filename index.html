          <h2>Harrods Department Store Targeted in Cyberattack, Following Similar Breaches at Other British Retailers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 15:22:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harrods, the luxury department store in London, has become the latest British retailer to experience a cyberattack, raising concerns about the vulnerability of high-end businesses to online security breaches. The store temporarily shut down some systems after detecting unauthorized access attempts but stated that customer payment data was not compromised. This incident follows recent cyberattacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, both of which suffered significant losses due to IT system shutdowns. It remains unclear whether these attacks are connected, but the events highlight the growing threat to retailers.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has engaged in diplomatic efforts to promote de-escalation. Rubio spoke with both the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the Indian Foreign Minister, emphasizing the need for cooperation against terrorism and urging both nations to maintain peace. While reaffirming the U.S. commitment to India, Rubio also encouraged New Delhi to work with Pakistan to ease tensions, while also pressing Pakistan to condemn the terror attack. The United Nations Secretary-General has also offered to mediate, as concerns grow over a potential military confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors, with both sides trading accusations and warnings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 15:21:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has declared that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face immediate secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the United States. This move aims to further pressure Iran by completely shutting down its oil exports, which the president alleges are used to finance militant groups. These comments are primarily directed at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, and come as the administration continues to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program. While the sanctions are unlikely to impact Iranian oil flows to China without targeting Beijing's state-owned enterprises, the announcement underscores Trump's negotiating strategy.</p>

          <p>The April jobs report from the Labor Department is expected to offer insights into the state of the U.S. economy, particularly whether recent economic challenges are temporary or indicative of a longer-term downturn.

A significantly lower number could heighten concerns about the economy, especially given ongoing trade tensions and tariff implementations.

          <p>Investors are closely watching Apple as it prepares to release its quarterly earnings amid concerns over President Trump's tariffs, which could complicate the company's supply chains. Apple's stock has declined 16% since the beginning of the year, but analysts predict a positive quarter with revenue estimates of $94.56 billion and earnings of $1.62 per share. The company's reliance on Chinese manufacturing raises concerns about potential cost increases due to tariffs, although Trump has previously made exceptions for consumer electronics. The impact of these trade policies on Apple's long-term profitability and consumer demand remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Governors in northeastern Nigeria are urging the government to adopt a new strategy to address the resurgence of Islamist militant attacks. The call comes amid a recent increase in violence that resulted in over 100 deaths last month. The governors emphasized the need for a multidimensional approach that combines military strategies with addressing the root causes of the insurgency, such as youth unemployment and poverty. They also highlighted the importance of regional cooperation, improved infrastructure, and investment opportunities to stabilize the region.</p>

          <p>The proposed Dodger Stadium gondola project has encountered a significant obstacle as a state appeals court rejected Metro's approval of the environmental impact report. The court decision requires Metro to set aside its certification of the EIR and approval of the project until a revised report is completed. The gondola, proposed in 2018, would connect Union Station to Dodger Stadium at a cost of $385 million to $500 million, but requires approval from multiple agencies.

The Department of Health and Human Services stated that "all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials" before approval, calling it a "radical departure" from existing standards. This announcement raises questions about the availability of updated COVID-19 shots expected for the fall, and the initiative may delay the approval of life-saving shots, potentially jeopardizing public health. Kennedy also announced efforts to develop new inoculations for COVID, bird flu, and seasonal flu, using methods other than mRNA technology.</p>

          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April as consumers rushed to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. The tariff fear-buying began in late March and continued into April, boosted by automakers offering special discounts. However, demand slowed in late April as vehicle inventories tightened and prices increased. Analysts suggest the higher costs and lower vehicle inventories could lead to lower sales in the future.</p>

          <p>With borrowing costs on the rise, settling debt for less than the full amount owed is becoming an increasingly relevant strategy. Creditors are often willing to negotiate, particularly if the debt is already delinquent, and they believe the borrower is experiencing genuine financial hardship. Most successful debt settlements result in paying 30% to 50% less than the original balance, often in a lump sum. While it's possible to negotiate a settlement independently, working with a debt relief expert can provide significant advantages, including expertise in negotiations and ensuring proper documentation.</p>
