          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating Google for potentially holding too much power in the online search market, where it accounts for over 90% of searches in the UK, and could require Google to link to rival search platforms. The CMA is exploring changes that would give consumers more choice and control over their search services, which could include choice screens and increased transparency for publishers. Google's parent company, Alphabet, expressed concerns that the suggestions were "broad and unfocused," but stated it would "work constructively" with the regulator. The watchdog's final decision is expected in October, with potential implications for businesses and consumers in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, the agreement quickly unraveled as both sides accused each other of violations. Israel reported Iranian missile launches shortly after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect, leading to renewed Israeli military action, and one missile struck the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people and wounding about 20 others. Iranian officials denied the Israeli claims, but the situation remains tense, with both countries warning of further responses to any violations. The conflict, which began on June 13, has resulted in at least 974 deaths in Iran and 28 deaths in Israel.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers are voting in a mayoral primary that could significantly impact the Democratic party, with Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani has gained momentum, especially among young voters, running on a progressive platform, while Cuomo has faced attacks focusing almost exclusively on Mamdani. The winner of the primary is likely to become the next mayor, given the city's Democratic lean, although incumbent Eric Adams is running as an independent candidate.

          <p>A coalition of private health insurance companies has pledged to standardize and reform the prior authorization process, aiming to reduce red tape for patients and healthcare providers. The pledge includes standardizing electronic submissions, reducing the number of services requiring prior authorization, honoring existing authorizations when patients change plans, and minimizing delays with real-time approvals. While this represents a voluntary commitment, federal health officials have stated they are prepared to issue new regulations if insurers do not abide by the agreement. The reforms come amid growing criticism of the prior authorization process and its impact on patient access to care.</p>
