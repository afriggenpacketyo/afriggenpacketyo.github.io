          <p>A driver intentionally rammed a vehicle into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring thirty people, seven of them critically. The incident occurred early Saturday after the driver reportedly made a U-turn specifically to target the group waiting to enter the Vermont Hollywood venue. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the car and assaulted him, with one individual shooting him before fleeing the scene. The driver is hospitalized in police custody, and authorities are investigating the event as an intentional act of violence, with potential charges including attempted murder.</p>

          <p>Former professional wrestling star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell has undergone an amputation of his right leg above the knee. The surgery was necessary due to severe complications from injuries sustained in a 2020 car crash, which never fully healed despite his efforts to recover. Bagwell, 55, was a prominent figure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) during the 1990s, where he was a five-time tag-team champion. The wrestling community has expressed an outpouring of support for him as he begins a new and difficult recovery process.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the UK are deepening their security and arms cooperation, forming a trio known as the "E3" in response to the war in Ukraine and uncertainty about future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on mutual assistance obligations and defense collaboration. This move signals a strategic pivot for Germany, aiming to bolster European self-reliance while navigating complex relationships with partners like the US and Poland. The E3 alliance represents a pragmatic step to enhance Europe's collective security, potentially supplementing the US defense guarantee.</p>

          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of data technology company Astronomer, has resigned from his position following a viral incident at a Coldplay concert. A video showed Byron embracing the company's chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, before the pair quickly hid their faces from the kiss-cam, prompting an on-stage remark from singer Chris Martin about a potential affair. The company, which recently secured a $93 million investment round, launched a formal investigation and placed Byron on leave. Astronomer's board accepted his resignation, stating that its leaders are expected to meet a high standard of conduct which was not met.</p>

          <p>Reports from Ukraine indicate that individuals with documented, severe mental health conditions are being drafted into the military, raising serious concerns about their well-being and the safety of their units. Systemic issues, such as incomplete digital medical records and the need for military doctors to guard against draft evasion, contribute to the problem. Human rights advocates and some commanders report seeing recruits with conditions like schizophrenia or developmental disabilities who are unfit for service but cannot be easily discharged. This situation highlights the immense strain on Ukraine's mobilization system and poses a danger to both the individuals and their fellow soldiers.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reached a deal in principle to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club. The move, likely a loan with an option to buy, comes as Barcelona seeks to strengthen its attack after failing to sign other targets like Nico Williams and Luis Diaz. Despite Rashford's inconsistent form in recent years, Barcelona is reportedly attracted by his potential and vast top-level experience. For Manchester United, the deal represents an opportunity to offload a high-profile player who is no longer part of the manager's plans and focus on rebuilding the squad.</p>

          <p>July 20th marks the 81st anniversary of the failed 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, led by German army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The plot, known as "Operation Valkyrie," involved planting a bomb in a briefcase during a meeting at the Wolf's Lair headquarters. Hitler survived the blast with minor injuries, and the subsequent coup attempt in Berlin unraveled due to delays and lack of support from key military leaders. While the plotters were executed and long considered traitors, they are now largely remembered as heroes who dared to resist the Nazi regime, symbolizing the German resistance movement.</p>

          <p>Ashley Kaye, 36, lives and travels full-time in a heavily modified Toyota Tacoma truck, a lifestyle she adopted after selling her home and quitting her job in 2020. She has journeyed along the Pan-American highway, spending an average of $1,305 per month on essentials like gas and food. Kaye invested over $50,000 to customize her truck with a camper, solar power, and other necessities for self-reliant travel. While she enjoys the freedom and pace of overlanding, she notes the logistical challenges of crossing borders and the constant effort of setting up and breaking down her mobile home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment. These groups are using rhetoric similar to Donald Trump's MAGA movement, blaming foreigners for crime and social disruption, despite data showing a decrease in arrests of foreign nationals. This nationalist push comes as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's popularity is falling and the country grapples with a weak yen that has fueled a massive influx of tourists. These parties argue against relying on foreign labor, even as Japan faces significant labor shortages due to its aging population.</p>

          <p>Detectives have released CCTV footage of a suspected killer chasing a man with a gun moments after 15-year-old Rene Graham was fatally shot in a west London park. Graham was shot in the chest during a music festival in July 2024. The new footage shows the suspect entering the park and later fleeing, gun in hand, before pursuing a second individual down the street. Police and the Crimestoppers charity, which is offering a £20,000 reward, are urging the community to come forward with information to identify the person responsible and bring justice for Rene's family.</p>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the collapse of a five-story building in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers last year, was "entirely preventable." The investigation revealed multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials, visible structural cracks, and ignoring red flags raised long before the disaster. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest over the conditions, yet work continued. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson has called for criminal accountability for the negligence that led to the tragedy, as survivors and families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a knee bone bruise much faster than initially anticipated. While first expected to miss six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting his return will be "a lot sooner than anticipated." The injury, sustained on July 2, was fortunately not as severe as it appeared, narrowly avoiding the need for surgery. Muncy's swift return is welcome news for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly in his absence, underscoring his importance to the team's lineup.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships has finally been awarded their gold medals in a ceremony at the London Diamond League. The team, including Roger Black and Iwan Thomas, was upgraded from silver after the US team was disqualified due to Antonio Pettigrew's 2008 confession to doping during that period. The belated ceremony gave the athletes a chance to receive their medals and hear their national anthem in front of a large home crowd. The moment recognized their achievement and the values they stood for, with the medal's significance enhanced by the long wait for justice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Brazil by revoking the U.S. visas of eight Supreme Court judges involved in the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. This action, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is a direct response to the court's investigation into Bolsonaro's alleged coup attempt. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the move as unacceptable interference in his country's justice system and an affront to national sovereignty. The sanctions have sparked nationalist anger in Brazil, even among some right-wing voices, complicating the political landscape as Bolsonaro faces a potential conviction.</p>

          <p>The early phase of the earnings season, combined with moderating inflation data, has provided support for the market, though concerns over potential tariffs remain. While some companies like Abbott Labs and Wells Fargo saw negative stock reactions to their reports, deeper analysis suggests underlying business strengths that were overlooked by the initial sellers. In contrast, Goldman Sachs produced very strong results, positioning it well for an improving economic environment. The overall trend indicates that many companies are successfully navigating the current economic challenges, though investors are cautioned against making snap judgments on complex quarterly results.
