          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offense for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig in November 2024. The Metropolitan Police charged Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, after being alerted to an online video of the incident. Kneecap has denied the offense, claiming it is political policing designed to distract from more important issues, such as the starvation in Gaza. The group asserts they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual.</p>

President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have condemned the attack as antisemitic, with Netanyahu ordering increased security at Israeli missions worldwide.

The injunction was sought by two Chagossian women who filed a case against the Foreign Office. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using an airbase on the archipelago, but the legal challenge has temporarily blocked the signing ceremony that was expected to occur on Thursday morning.</p>

          <p>Mayuri Chari and Janhavi Khemka are two Indian women artists using their art to challenge societal norms and express personal experiences. Khemka, who is hearing-impaired, explores sound through vibration in her interdisciplinary works, while Chari focuses on the female body and challenges how women are seen in Indian society. Chari's work has faced controversy and rejection from Indian galleries, but resonates strongly with Indian women who see their experiences reflected in her art. Both artists have garnered international attention and offer advice to aspiring young artists, encouraging them to remain free and independent thinkers.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching £20.2 billion, which is £1 billion more than the previous year and higher than analysts' predictions. This figure marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since records began in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics. While tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pensions and benefits. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at £148.3 billion, which is £3.7 billion less than initially thought but still £11 billion more than expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>

          <p>A South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, appeared on Tucker Carlson's show, promoting the false claim that white people in South Africa are victims of racism. This narrative has influenced the Trump administration, leading to an executive order offering refugee status to "ethnic minority Afrikaners." The article argues that this is a misrepresentation of the situation in South Africa, where white South Africans still benefit from apartheid's economic legacy. The author suggests that this is an attempt to flip the narrative of apartheid and cast former oppressors as victims.</p>

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and support from President Trump have further boosted the cryptocurrency market.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng have risen sharply in Hong Kong following positive earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts predict Xpeng will become profitable in the fourth quarter of this year due to strong sales and new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by increased vehicle deliveries.

          <p>A new study indicates that wildfire smoke, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs annually in the United States. From 2006 to 2020, climate change was linked to approximately 15,000 deaths due to exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. The study highlights the increased toxicity of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke compared to other sources of pollution, impacting vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant individuals, and the elderly. The research emphasizes the need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing land management practices to mitigate the problem.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the increasing divisions within the UK and the challenges facing Prime Minister Keir Starmer in mending them. Public confidence in the government is at record lows, and centrifugal forces have fragmented the country. Starmer's attempt to address this through the Council of the Nations and Regions is a fundamental test of modern British governance. The author argues that collaboration between different parts of the UK's devolved system is crucial for any government to achieve its priorities.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are planning a vote to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend such a vote is illegal. The vote could impact numerous states that have adopted California's vehicle standards, and California is prepared to sue if the waivers are revoked.</p>
