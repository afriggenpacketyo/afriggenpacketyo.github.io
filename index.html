          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals with experience in destinations like the Maldives and Bali, shared their insights on the realities of working in paradise. They emphasize that resort life for employees is quite different from the vacation experience, often involving long periods of being confined to a staff village with its own unique social dynamics. Managing a multicultural workforce and addressing maintenance challenges caused by saltwater or humidity are also key aspects of their roles. The couple also highlighted the challenge of living far from family, but they've adapted by traveling home annually and adopting two dogs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report by Oxford Economics projects an $8.5 billion decrease in spending from international tourists in the U.S. this year, attributing the decline to negative perceptions related to trade and immigration policies. This translates to a roughly 9% drop in international arrivals, impacting businesses and regions that rely on foreign tourism for revenue. Other estimates, such as one from the World Travel & Tourism Council, suggest the potential economic losses could be even larger, reaching $12.5 billion in 2025. The drop in flight bookings signals that travelers are choosing other destinations, with Europe and Canada experiencing significantly less impact.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation into alleged hateful comments directed at Chicago Sky star Angel Reese after a game against the Indiana Fever, the WNBA announced it could not substantiate the claims. The investigation was prompted by reports of racist remarks made by fans after Reese was fouled by Caitlin Clark. Reese had previously accused Clark's fans of racism and claimed they created AI-generated explicit images of her. Despite the league's finding, Reese stated she received support from across the league, emphasizing that there's no place for hate speech in the WNBA.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the removal of the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC's immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, a decision that could impact medical guidance and insurance coverage. The move bypassed the CDC's advisory panel, which typically votes on such recommendations, and has drawn criticism from medical organizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists expressed concern over the process and potential negative impacts on vaccine access and confidence.

          <p>In Vannes, France, surgeon Joel Le Scouarnec awaits sentencing after admitting to sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly children. The case has raised questions about how such abuse could occur undetected by authorities and whether adequate safeguards are in place to prevent future incidents. While Le Scouarnec has asked for no leniency, the trial has received less attention compared to other high-profile cases, reflecting a societal difficulty in addressing sexual violence toward children. The incident has been described as bringing shame to the Brittany region, where the surgeon began his activity.</p>

          <p>Vanguard's new research indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing even high income or asset levels. The study, surveying over 12,000 Vanguard investors, found that this amount provides confidence in handling unexpected expenses, with the median emergency costing around $2,000. People with emergency savings also spend less time worrying about their finances each week. While saving $2,000 may be challenging for some, starting small and automating savings can make a significant difference (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ron and Russell Mael of the band Sparks, Los Angeles natives, discussed their early influences and their latest album, "MAD!" The brothers credit their recent surge in mainstream recognition to cinema, including the documentary "The Sparks Brothers" and the film "Annette." The band's music remains inventive and witty, drawing inspiration from sunshiny moments and wistful memories. One song on the new album, "I-405," is a surprising ode to the 405 Freeway, capturing the drama and beauty beneath the bumper-to-bumper frustration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is trying to locate residents who lost their homes in the Palisades or Eaton fires and are owed property tax refunds due to the reassessment of their damaged properties. The county has sent out roughly 9,700 checks totaling $26 million, but about 330 remain undeliverable because the U.S. Postal Service could not reach vacant or destroyed homes. County officials are urging displaced residents to update their mailing addresses to ensure they receive their refunds. The county assessor's office has obtained new addresses for residents who filed tax relief claims, but other eligible households have not filed, creating address gaps.</p>

The author contends that NIH grant funding is a valuable investment, generating significant economic activity and improving human health.

The federal indictment alleges that Combs and his associates lured female victims, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship, and used force, threats, coercion, and controlled substances to get women to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes.

The bill includes extending tax cuts and ending clean energy incentives, while also funding border wall construction and mass deportations.

          <p>Tesco shoppers are reacting to the introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, with some joking that it resembles Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology used in football. The supermarket is implementing overhead cameras to detect when shoppers fail to scan an item correctly, displaying a live-action replay of the unscanned item. While some shoppers mocked the tech, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance, with some saying they would avoid self-checkouts altogether. The move comes as shoplifting in the UK has hit a record high in 2024.</p>

Residents argue that the plan could significantly alter the community's character and urge the zoning commission to maintain the property's business zoning.
