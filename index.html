The regulator summoned Nvidia to address potential vulnerabilities, including tracking and remote shutdown capabilities, which have been highlighted by U.S. lawmakers proposing mandatory security features on advanced chip exports. This scrutiny adds a new geopolitical challenge for Nvidia, which is trying to navigate U.S. export restrictions while serving the lucrative Chinese market. The company had previously taken a significant writedown on unsold H20 inventory due to the curbs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German federal government has approved a draft budget for 2026 that includes substantial cuts to development aid and humanitarian emergency funds, drawing sharp criticism from aid organizations. The budget for the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development is set to fall below €10 billion for the first time since 2018, and the Foreign Office's humanitarian aid budget will be more than halved. Aid groups like Caritas International warn this will have severe consequences for people in the Global South and could jeopardize life-saving projects. The government cited the need to prioritize military readiness in response to Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>A new report from Microsoft suggests that blue-collar jobs requiring physical labor are among the least likely to be impacted by generative artificial intelligence. Researchers analyzed user interactions with the Bing Copilot AI and found that tasks involving information gathering and writing were most frequently and successfully performed by AI, placing roles like translators and writers at higher risk. In contrast, professions such as painters, nursing assistants, and automotive repairers were deemed safer from AI replacement. The report highlights a growing trend where manual and skilled-trade jobs offer more stability in the face of AI advancements.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a woman who accused Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse and died by suicide in April, has publicly asked President Donald Trump not to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell. In a statement, they called Maxwell a "monster" who deserves to remain in prison for her role as Epstein's accomplice. The family also questioned recent remarks by Trump in which he claimed Giuffre was "stolen" from her job at his Mar-a-Lago resort, asking if this implied he was aware of the criminal activities. They condemned recent meetings between Maxwell and federal prosecutors, asserting she cannot be trusted.</p>

Despite battling bronchitis and facing personal setbacks, Jorgenson repeatedly launched attacks to wear down Pogačar, even when a victory for his team seemed hopeless. His persistent efforts ultimately created an opening for his teammate Wout van Aert to win the final stage, demonstrating the profound impact of selfless teamwork in professional cycling.</p>

Critics also point out that a ban could push young people to less safe corners of the internet and that social media can offer positive connections for marginalized youth.

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two changes to his starting lineup for the series-deciding final Test against Australia in Sydney. With the series already won, Blair Kinghorn comes in on the left wing to replace James Lowe, and James Ryan is selected at lock in place of Ollie Chessum. The selection features nine Irish players in the starting team and reflects a focus on cohesion, with eleven players having started all three Test matches. The replacements bench includes a six-two split between forwards and backs, with Owen Farrell and Ben Earl providing versatile cover.</p>

          <h2>Reform UK Would Need to Implement Unpopular Policies, Says Think Tank Advisor</h2>

          <p>An advisor to a new pro-Reform UK think tank has stated that a future Reform government would need to administer "nasty cough medicine" to the country by implementing unpopular economic policies. James Orr, chairman of the Centre for a Better Britain's advisory board, told the BBC that the party would have to act quickly within its first 100 days to fix the economy, acknowledging it doesn't have a "magic wand." He suggested Reform should learn from Donald Trump's approach of implementing a pre-planned agenda, even if some policies are initially unpopular. This reflects the challenge the party faces in developing a fully costed platform.</p>

          <p>With President Trump's August 1 tariff deadline imminent, the global trade landscape remains unsettled, with only eight deals finalized in 120 days. The agreements, including those with the UK, EU, Japan, and South Korea, generally establish baseline tariffs of 10-20%, which is higher than pre-existing rates but lower than the steepest threats. Key trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and India still face the prospect of high tariffs of 35%, 30%, and 25% respectively, with negotiations stalled over various political and economic issues. Meanwhile, talks with China are ongoing, with a temporary truce on escalating duties currently in place. (not investment advice)</p>

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired "warning shots" after a crowd gathered around aid trucks but were not aware of casualties from their fire. This incident adds to the more than 1,000 Palestinians the UN says have been killed while trying to access food aid since late May. It comes as UN-backed experts warn that famine is actively unfolding in Gaza despite recent Israeli announcements of "tactical pauses" for aid delivery.</p>

          <p>Despite facing a 25% U.S. tariff, India has strategically avoided rushing into a trade deal, primarily to protect its domestic agricultural sector from American competition. Indian officials have maintained that the interests of their farmers, a crucial voting bloc, are a "red line" and that they will not negotiate based on deadlines. Analysts suggest that because exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of its economy, India has the leverage to resist concessions. Furthermore, India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade deals with other partners like the U.K. and the E.U. to diversify its economic relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

In the Newcastle match, a skillful dribble by Dowman into the penalty area won the game-deciding penalty kick.
