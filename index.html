          <p>This New York Times article discusses Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency, highlighting potential conflicts of interest and constitutional issues. Experts argue that Trump's promotion of meme coins and stablecoins, along with soliciting investments from foreign entities, blurs the lines between private enterprise and government policy. The article cites concerns about bribery, corruption, and violations of the emoluments clauses, questioning whether Trump is using his position to enrich himself and his family through crypto ventures. Some critics within the crypto industry fear that Trump's involvement could harm the industry's reputation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that India stated its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it calls "terrorist infrastructure." The Defence Ministry says the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted, and that the operation followed a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given, according to AP.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat's New York Times article examines the Apple TV show "Your Friends & Neighbors," which portrays the lives of wealthy Connecticut residents as unhappy and financially insecure. The article contrasts this portrayal with more aspirational depictions of wealth in shows like "Selling Sunset," suggesting that the new show offers a reassuring perspective for those experiencing meritocratic status anxiety. The author questions whether the show's bleak depiction of the rich is accurate, noting that cultural trends have stripped away some of the glamour and aesthetic distinction that once characterized upper-class lifestyles.</p>

Democrats are pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from benefiting from crypto assets, citing potential conflicts of interest and corruption.
