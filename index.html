        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia announced a robust 56% surge in revenue to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, primarily propelled by the escalating demand for AI capabilities from major tech companies like Meta and OpenAI. Despite these impressive financial results, Nvidia continues to grapple with complex geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, which contributed to a slight dip in its shares during after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang underscored the intensity of the global AI race, noting a substantial increase in annual spending from leading tech firms. The company is actively lobbying the U.S. government to secure approval for the sale of its advanced Blackwell chips to China, a critical market, even as analysts highlight China's strategic efforts to foster domestic competition in the semiconductor sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a proposed rule aiming to cap the length of stay for international students in the U.S. at four years, a significant departure from the current "duration of status" policy. This initiative, slated for publication on Thursday, seeks to combat perceived "visa abuse" and bolster the Department of Homeland Security's capacity for vetting and overseeing foreign nationals. DHS officials argue that some foreign students have exploited U.S. generosity by remaining enrolled indefinitely, posing safety risks and incurring taxpayer costs. However, critics, including NAFSA: Association of International Educators, contend that this restrictive measure will likely deter international students from choosing the U.S., potentially harming American economies, innovation, and global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>A devastating shooting at Annunciation Church, a Catholic school in Minneapolis, tragically claimed the lives of two children, aged eight and ten, and left seventeen others injured, including fourteen children and three elderly parishioners. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, with the FBI investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Authorities are examining a manifesto the suspect timed to publish on YouTube and are working to determine if all shots originated from outside the building. Community leaders, including Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz, expressed profound sorrow and frustration, highlighting the pervasive trauma and the recurring nature of such senseless violence across the nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's recent engagement has ignited widespread discussion about parasocial relationships, a phenomenon where individuals develop one-sided emotional connections with celebrities. Fans reacted with intense personal joy and tears, exemplifying the illusion of intimacy fostered by constant access to stars' private lives through social media and reality television. Psychologist Sonia Jaeger describes these as "my friend who doesn't know me" connections, which can fulfill a universal human need for connection, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, experts caution that while these relationships can offer a sense of community and distraction, they are akin to "fast food" for emotional needs, as they lack the reciprocal affection and genuine support found in real-life friendships.</p>

This significant increase, now accounting for 51% of all low-value imports, has prompted the UK government to initiate a review of the £135 customs duty exemption. UK business owners and industry groups are advocating for swift action, arguing that the current rules enable overseas companies to unfairly undercut High Street retailers and expose consumers to potentially unregulated or unsafe products. While the Treasury's review is ongoing, the article notes that other major economies, including the U.S. and the EU, have already moved to adjust or eliminate similar low-value import exemptions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning that Donald Trump is gravely serious about seeking a third presidential term, a move that would fundamentally violate the U.S. Constitution. Newsom, a prominent Democrat and potential presidential contender, expressed deep concern over what he described as Trump’s flagrant disregard for democratic norms. He recounted a private Oval Office meeting where Trump allegedly referenced Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented four terms, reinforcing Newsom's conviction about the former president's intentions. The governor urged Americans to "wake up" and take these threats seriously, emphasizing that the rule of law is being challenged and that Democrats must actively "fight fire with fire" to protect the nation's foundational principles.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, issued a firm warning against external interference in the relationship between China and South Korea, asserting that their bilateral ties are rooted in mutual interests and are not aimed at any third party. This diplomatic statement follows South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's recent assessment that Seoul must rebalance its relationship with Beijing amidst intensifying U.S.-China competition. President Lee indicated that South Korea can no longer maintain its previous strategic approach of relying on the U.S. for security while simultaneously fostering economic cooperation with China. He stressed that South Korea's future decisions must align with America's fundamental policy stance, highlighting the delicate geopolitical tightrope Seoul is navigating.</p>

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China’s second-largest liquor distiller, has reported its slowest earnings growth in a decade, with first-half revenue increasing by 4.2% and net profit attributable to equity holders rising by a mere 2.3%. This significant downturn reflects the dual impact of an intensified anti-corruption campaign, which has curtailed ostentatious consumption, and a broader economic slowdown affecting the entire baijiu industry. Major competitors, including Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, have also experienced their slowest growth or sharp declines in profit. The article highlights how government policy factors have led to a substantial reduction in baijiu consumption, a culturally significant drink, thereby severely impacting the sales and profitability of mainstream products across the sector.</p>

          <p>Argentinian authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, "Portrait of a Lady" by Guiseppe Vittore Ghislandi, which is believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago. The painting, originally part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection, recently resurfaced in a real estate advertisement for a property in Argentina thought to be owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive, Friedrich Kadgien. Police conducted a raid on the seaside villa but did not locate the artwork, though they discovered relevant German documents from the 1940s. This renewed search underscores Argentina's historical role as a refuge for Nazis and the ongoing international efforts to recover plundered Jewish property, even decades after World War II.</p>

The penalty, imposed by the United States Tennis Association, will result in the Russian forfeiting approximately 40% of his first-round prize money.

While No 10 officially disputes concerns about Pandit's effectiveness, sources indicate the Prime Minister had grown dissatisfied with her performance. The principal private secretary position is considered one of the most prestigious in the civil service, acting as the Prime Minister's gatekeeper, controlling information flow, shaping their diary, and often serving as a stepping stone to major government positions.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK is increasingly perceived as an existential threat to the Scottish Conservatives, consistently outpolling them and attracting defections from Tory MSPs and councillors. This surge in Reform's influence is part of a broader UK-wide trend, significantly reshaping the political landscape ahead of next May's Holyrood election. Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay faces immense pressure to counter this challenge, potentially by shifting his party further to the right, though this strategy risks alienating the moderate center-right voter base established under previous leadership. The article underscores the growing fragmentation within the Scottish Tory ranks and the difficulty of defining their identity amidst Reform's potent anti-establishment narrative, setting the stage for an intense struggle for voter support.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's latest film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, features Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life descends into a violent crime caper in the gritty backdrop of 1998 New York City. After a series of unfortunate events, Hank finds himself relentlessly pursued by various criminal factions and the NYPD, forcing him to confront his past athletic glory and present failures. The article commends Aronofsky's affectionate, albeit grimy, portrayal of pre-millennial New York and Butler's compelling performance as a charismatic yet self-loathing protagonist. The film delves into Aronofsky's recurring themes of squandered potential and the heavy burden of talent, showcasing his consistent fascination with characters teetering on the brink of losing their way.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and the Philippines are markedly escalating at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, with Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad of the Philippine Navy reporting the presence of a 1,500-tonne Chinese tugboat near the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. Satellite tracking data further revealed that two Philippine coastguard ships and a civilian fishery patrol vessel were intercepted by a Chinese coastguard ship while en route to the shoal. Despite recent periods of what was described as "peaceful coexistence," the return of heightened tensions is palpable as a crucial resupply deadline for the Philippine outpost looms. This situation underscores the persistent territorial disputes and the potential for increased friction and conflict in the strategically vital South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an ace-level pitching performance, leading the Dodgers to a dominant 5-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds and securing a sweep of the series. Marking a significant stride in his return from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched five full innings of one-run ball, impressively tallying nine strikeouts, his highest count in over two years. This outing showcased a strategic shift, as he effectively incorporated a wider array of pitches, moving beyond his previous reliance on fastballs and sweepers. Manager Dave Roberts lauded Ohtani's enhanced ability to work deep into the game, a critical development that could prove pivotal for his role in the upcoming postseason.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian missile and drone strike on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday tragically resulted in at least eight confirmed deaths, including a child, and left dozens more injured, with fears that additional individuals may still be trapped under rubble. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vehemently condemned the attack, accusing Russia of deliberately choosing "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" and exploiting the world's perceived complacency. He urgently called for new, stringent sanctions against Russia and specifically appealed for reactions from China and Hungary, key partners of the Kremlin. Zelenskyy also announced that Ukrainian chief negotiators would meet U.S. government representatives in New York to discuss concrete security guarantees aimed at deterring future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>USC has extended a new multi-year offer to Notre Dame, aiming to preserve their century-old football rivalry amidst public concern over its potential discontinuation. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed strong optimism for an agreement soon, acknowledging the profound importance of the series to both fan bases and athletic programs. The primary obstacle in negotiations remains the game's scheduling, with USC advocating for an earlier season date to better accommodate its demanding Big Ten travel schedule. Conversely, Notre Dame enjoys greater flexibility in its scheduling. This article highlights the intricate challenges of maintaining historic rivalries within the evolving landscape of college football, as both institutions strive to balance tradition with their strategic interests.</p>

          <p>Europe is currently enduring its most severe wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares—an area equivalent to half the landmass of Wales—already burned across the European Union this year. Spain and Portugal have been particularly devastated, losing approximately 1% of the entire Iberian Peninsula to fires, a figure six times their historical average for this period. A comprehensive study by the World Weather Attribution group directly links these worsening conditions to human-induced climate change, issuing stark warnings of more frequent and intense fires in the future. The blazes are also releasing record amounts of CO2, contributing to a dangerous climate feedback loop, while rural depopulation exacerbates the problem by increasing flammable vegetation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated the transfer of detainees from the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, following a federal judge's order to dismantle specific parts of the facility. DHS criticized the ruling as an attempt by an "activist judge" to impede the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, asserting its commitment to remove "the worst of the worst." The facility, a component of the administration's broader push to expand immigration detention, has faced numerous allegations of inhumane conditions, including lack of water and limited legal access, alongside legal challenges regarding environmental laws. The judge's refusal to halt her ruling pending appeal intensifies the ongoing legal and political standoff over the facility's operations.</p>

Her defense received a significant boost from testimony by her obstetrician and his receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, who described seeing Ellis initiate physical contact and sustain an injury to her own forehead. Malcolm testified that Cardi B was behind her during the altercation, making it highly improbable that the rapper caused the injury.

Monarez, the first Senate-confirmed CDC director, reportedly ran afoul of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over her refusal to endorse sweeping changes to vaccine policies. Her controversial removal triggered a wave of high-profile resignations from senior CDC leaders, who cited the "weaponizing of public health" and the dangerous politicization of science as their reasons for departure. This unprecedented leadership crisis has raised alarm among public health experts, who warn of severe consequences for the nation's preparedness and scientific integrity.</p>

As the U.S. and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks, speculation about Beijing introducing yuan-backed stablecoins to internationalize its currency is growing.
