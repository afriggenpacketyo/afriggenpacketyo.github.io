          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following what he described as "outrageous" U.S. attacks on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. The strikes, targeting the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, have dramatically escalated geopolitical tensions in the region, prompting Araghchi to warn of "everlasting consequences." According to Iran state-owned media Fars, Iran also launched its 20th wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets, with the Israel Defense Forces reporting sirens and initiating missile offensives in western Iran. President Trump claimed the strikes were a "spectacular military success," though this claim has not been independently verified. The optimism score for this article is 15.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, four seriously, according to paramedics. Iranian missiles impacted four sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, with searches underway for individuals trapped under rubble in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces reported approximately 30 missiles were launched, and images showed significant building damage and rescue efforts. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion" against Iran, Iran has reportedly fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel, resulting in 24 deaths in Israel, and 722 deaths in Iran according to Human Rights Activists in Iran.

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original investigation. Despite maintaining her innocence and arguing that authorities focused solely on her, Dorotik's initial appeals were denied. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office eventually recommended overturning the conviction due to the new evidence, and in May 2022, prosecutors dropped the charges, citing insufficient evidence.

          <p>Chinese scientists are investigating the potential of the spleen as a hub for treating diabetes through cell transplantation. Research indicates that "shielding" islet cells can improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen, offering a more promising long-term survival site than the liver. The scientists also found that the spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub using nanoparticles. These advancements could transform the spleen into an ideal organ for islet transplantation, potentially benefiting the over 140 million adults with diabetes in China.

The device is designed for quick and ultra-portable deployment for defence and industrial purposes. The innovation stabilizes laser performance across 100-degree temperature swings through design choices such as 940-nanometre pump lasers and heat-sensitive component isolation. The laser's core features a dual-clad optical resonator amplifying photons into a lethal 1,080nm beam. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pledge to be a peacemaker and unifier during his inauguration stands in stark contrast to the recent US military action in Iran. The US launched a direct military strike on Iranian nuclear sites, marking a significant escalation in the region. This decision breaks from Trump's prior promises to keep the United States out of war and end chaos in the Middle East. While consistently opposing Iran's nuclear capabilities, the latest action contradicts his earlier vows to avoid military conflict. The optimism score for this article is 20.</p>
