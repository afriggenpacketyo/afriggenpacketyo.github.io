          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court election, the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history, is seen as a key indicator of public sentiment towards President Trump's second term.  The race pits Republican-backed Brad Schimel against Democrat-backed Susan Crawford, with significant financial backing from Elon Musk supporting Schimel.  The outcome will influence the court's ideological balance and its handling of crucial issues like abortion access and redistricting, potentially impacting the balance of power in Congress.  Musk's involvement highlights the increasing intersection of big money and judicial elections.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer strongly criticizes President Trump's proposed 20% tariff on most imports, arguing it would severely harm the U.S. economy.  Cramer acknowledges Trump's aim to protect domestic industries but highlights several flaws in the plan, including its potential to worsen inflation and its impracticality given current staffing levels in customs and immigration.  He points to historical precedents where similar tariffs led to economic downturns.  The proposal is seen as a significant departure from established trade policies and could trigger retaliatory measures from other countries.</p>

          <p>Widespread job cuts ordered by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have resulted in the elimination of entire FOIA processing teams at the CDC and significant reductions at the FDA.

The cuts contradict Kennedy's previous statements supporting transparency and raise questions about the handling of pending FOIA requests. The move is part of a broader effort to centralize FOIA processing within HHS, but the effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain.</p>
