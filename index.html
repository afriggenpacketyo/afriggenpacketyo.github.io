          <h2>Millennials' Hesitation Towards Parenthood Examined</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article explores the reasons behind the declining fertility rate among millennials and Gen Z, suggesting that it's not solely due to financial constraints or career aspirations. The author posits that evolving definitions of harm, abuse, neglect, and trauma have led to impossibly high standards for parenting, making potential parents hesitant. Adult children are increasingly likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional or relational struggles, contributing to the apprehension around parenthood and the pressure to provide a perfect upbringing. This cultural shift has created a daunting landscape for those considering starting a family. Optimism for the topic is not high due to the nature of the topic.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 12:59:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from DW examines Switzerland's successful approach to predicting landslides, highlighting its use of technology and continuous monitoring of environmental factors. The recent landslide in Blatten, where early warnings allowed for evacuation, showcases the effectiveness of the Swiss system, which includes terrain mapping and data collection on rainfall, permafrost melt, and ground movement. Despite Switzerland's advancements, the article emphasizes the global challenge of landslide prediction, noting that many regions lack the resources and infrastructure for effective early warning systems. International efforts, such as the UN's Early Warnings for All initiative, aim to improve global preparedness and save lives from these unpredictable disasters. The fact that no one died is a testament to the early warning system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed Republican plan for student loans, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is drawing criticism for potentially extending repayment timelines to up to 30 years. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz argues that such a long repayment period amounts to "indentured servitude," raising concerns about borrowers carrying debt into middle age. The bill would reduce the number of repayment options to two: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan (IDR) called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) that offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. While some argue the plan ensures borrowers eventually pay off their principal, critics worry about the burden of prolonged debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, amidst ongoing questions regarding the proposed merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are seeking clarity on the structure of the deal, which Trump has described as a "partnership" ensuring U.S. control and a $14 billion investment by Nippon. However, details remain scarce, with U.S. Steel characterizing the deal as a merger where it becomes a "wholly owned subsidiary" of Nippon Steel North America.

          <p>Todd Chrisley, formerly of "Chrisley Knows Best," announced a new reality show following his and his wife Julie's pardon by President Trump after serving time for bank fraud and tax evasion. The new show will focus on the couple's legal battles and aim to "set the record straight," according to their daughter Savannah. Cameras began filming the night they returned home, capturing their reunion after being separated in prison. Chrisley maintains that his prosecution was politically motivated, while jurors had previously found that the couple submitted fake financial documents to obtain loans and concealed millions in income.

          <p>The UK Treasury has sold its final shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of government ownership nearly two decades after the bank's bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The government spent Â£45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in RBS, now part of NatWest, to prevent its collapse, which would have devastated the UK economy. While taxpayers did not fully recoup the investment, experts argue the bailout was essential to saving the economy. The article also explores whether UK banks are now safer and less likely to require taxpayer bailouts in future crises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic profiles Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, two leading extremists in Israel's right-wing government, who both advocate for reoccupying Gaza and encouraging Palestinian emigration. Smotrich, the finance minister, is described as a "Leninist" driven by religious Zionism, while Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, is characterized as a rabble-rouser influenced by the teachings of Meir Kahane. The article highlights their rivalry and the significant influence they exert on Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies, particularly regarding the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Their rise to power reflects a broader trend of chauvinistic parties gaining influence, shaping the political landscape in Israel.</p>

          <p>This DW article examines the upcoming presidential runoff in Poland, where voters are often more motivated by who they *don't* want in office rather than who they support. The article explores the voting preferences of Polish citizens living in Germany, who tend to favor liberal, pro-European candidates over nationalist conservatives. Many voters express wariness of the traditional two-party system and seek new alternatives, even if it means supporting far-right figures. The election is seen as crucial, with every vote potentially tipping the scale and influencing the direction of Poland's political landscape.</p>

The BBC argued that its reporting was fair and reasonable on a matter of public interest, but the jury found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith. The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder. The case has raised questions about journalistic standards and potential political pressure on the BBC.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic discusses why many Americans are seeking alternatives to traditional institutions like the 9-to-5 workplace and the medical industry. Distrust in these systems, driven by factors like high costs and perceived prioritization of profits over people, has led many to explore options like wellness treatments and multilevel marketing schemes. The second Trump administration has opened the gates to medical skeptics. While some alternatives may offer productive reforms, others are proving demonstrably worse. This trend reflects a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo and a desire for solutions that address unmet needs.</p>
