            <h2>Freight Orders Surge Following Pause on Tariffs, but Uncertainty Persists</h2>

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to temporarily pause tariffs on several trading partners, freight orders have seen a surge as companies resume previously halted shipments. This reversal has led to a feeling of reward for companies that paused shipments, with bookings skyrocketing across various sectors. However, uncertainty remains high, especially concerning trade relations with China and Mexico, where tariffs remain in effect. The automotive and aerospace industries, particularly, are holding back on significant movements, awaiting further clarity on trade policies, reflecting a 'super cautious' moment in global trade.</p>

            <p>US stock markets experienced a significant decline on Thursday following the White House's announcement that tariff rates on imports from China have increased to 145%, a jump from the previously communicated 125% figure.

            <p>A Netflix docuseries highlights the arrest of Rex Heuermann, the alleged Long Island serial killer, while also exposing how corruption within the Suffolk County Police Department hindered the investigation for years. The series emphasizes the families' long search for justice for the "Gilgo Four" victims and reveals how a new police chief and task force quickly identified Heuermann by tracing phone records, which had been neglected under previous leadership. The investigation was hampered by the former police chief's efforts to cover up his own misconduct, leading to a war between the police and the FBI, and now, with the initial phase of the investigation closed, the remaining victims may never receive justice.</p>

            <p>Wednesday's sudden surge in stocks was driven by a historic short squeeze, as hedge funds rushed to close out their positions amid news of a tariff pause. These traders had previously bet on share price declines, accumulating record short positions against US stocks. However, the unexpected rally forced them to rapidly buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses, creating an artificial buying force that propelled the S&P 500 to its third-biggest gain since World War II.

            <p>President Trump's trade war has injected significant uncertainty into the oil market, causing wild price swings and undermining investor confidence, which threatens domestic oil production. The on-again, off-again approach to tariffs has created an environment of extreme uncertainty, making oil companies hesitant to make investment decisions.

            <p>In response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, China's National Film Administration has announced plans to reduce the number of American films allowed to be shown in the country.

China Film indicated it would follow market rules and respect audience choice, but would moderately reduce the number of American films imported, a move that could significantly impact Hollywood's access to the world's second-largest film market.</p>

            <p>Adam Beckman, a minor league player for the New York Islanders, received a 10-game suspension for physically abusing a referee during a recent game. The incident occurred in the third period of a game against the Charlotte Checkers, where Beckman appeared to shove the official into the boards. The suspension means Beckman will miss the remainder of the regular season and the next five games he is active on an AHL roster.

            <p>Donald Trump's recent tariff pause has brought some relief to global markets, but significant uncertainty remains regarding the future of international trade. While the pause suspends some tariffs for 90 days, a minimum 10% tariff remains in place for goods from all countries, except for pharmaceuticals and microchips. The tariffs on Chinese goods have increased to 145%, further intensifying the trade war between the US and China. Economists warn that these policies, even with the pause, represent a major shift in US trade policy that could harm the global economy.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent reversal on tariffs demonstrates that Wall Street still holds significant influence within his administration. After stocks plunged following the announcement of sweeping tariffs, Trump relented and rolled back the highest tariffs on most countries except China. This decision came after warnings from figures like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who cautioned that the policy could push the US economy into recession. The episode highlights that the market, and by extension, Wall Street, serves as a check on the administration's economic policies.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's recent backtracking on tariffs, the situation remains far from resolved, according to Faisal Islam. The US has erected a significant protectionist tariff wall, unseen since the 1930s, which will heavily impact business between the US and China, two major economic superpowers. The move has also triggered concerns about currency wars and highlighted vulnerabilities in the US bond market. Furthermore, the handling of the situation has created leverage for the rest of the world, making it difficult for the US to negotiate with both allies and adversaries.</p>

            <p>President Trump was reportedly aware that his proposed tariff plan could trigger a recession, but he was more concerned with preventing a depression, according to The Wall Street Journal. Trump was willing to accept "pain" from the policy, but the bond market's reaction, with yields soaring, contributed to his decision to roll back some tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's increasing role in advising on trade policy also influenced the decision. The episode highlights the tension between Trump's economic agenda and the potential consequences for the market.</p>

Some local union members are allegedly dissatisfied with the handling of the dispute, which has resulted in thousands of tonnes of rubbish accumulating on the city's streets. The industrial action centers on the loss of a job role, with Unite arguing it would affect workers' pay and progression, while the council disputes the number of staff affected and the financial impact.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on Chinese goods, could significantly impact the cost of popular gadgets like iPhones in the US. With a 145% tariff now in effect, analysts suggest that iPhone prices could rise substantially if costs are passed onto consumers. Apple is reportedly exploring options to diversify its supply chains, including increasing production in India, but relocating supply chains is a complex and costly undertaking. The impact of tariffs on iPhone prices remains uncertain, but consumers may face higher costs or longer contracts to offset the increased expenses.</p>
