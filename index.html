          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Allowing Limited Uranium Enrichment by Iran.</h2>

          <p>According to an Axios report, the Trump administration is considering allowing Iran to continue limited low-level uranium enrichment on its soil for an unspecified period as part of a proposed nuclear deal. This proposal includes strict conditions, such as preventing Iran from building new enrichment facilities, dismantling critical infrastructure, and halting research on advanced centrifuges. Iran would be required to reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% and shut down all underground enrichment facilities for a specified time. The White House insists the deal's terms are tough and would prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but media reports suggest Iranian officials plan to reject the deal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides relief for older borrowers who rely on fixed incomes, as the government can seize up to 15% of their Social Security checks to repay defaulted loans. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default, and advocates have expressed concern about the potential impact on their financial stability. The pause allows borrowers more time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks in the future (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, featuring him with a more shadowed face and wearing a red tie. This updated portrait differs from the earlier version released by his transition office, which showed him with a brightly lit face, a blue tie, and the American flag in the background. The new portrait, taken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok, will replace the existing official photographs of Trump in federal buildings and offices. The reasons for the update were not immediately disclosed.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that measles vaccination rates in children have declined in most U.S. counties since before the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant variations within states. The MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in 2017-2018 to 91.26% in 2023-2024 across 33 states, with 78% of counties experiencing a decline. This decrease in vaccination coverage comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 96% of reported cases being unvaccinated or having unknown vaccination status.
