          <h2>French Prime Minister Supports Suspending Macron's Pension Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 10:17:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has indicated his support for suspending President Macron's unpopular pension reform plans, which aim to raise the retirement age. Lecornu stated he would propose to parliament that the 2023 pension reform be suspended until after the next presidential elections, meaning there would be no increase in the retirement age before January 2028. This proposal, if realized, would mean Macron would fail to raise France's retirement age during his tenure, amid opposition from socialist and far-right blocs. Lecornu is seeking to pass a partial budget for 2026 to enable his government to function, but faces stiff resistance in parliament. The original proposal was to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with all business divisions achieving record revenue. The bank's adjusted earnings per share were $2.24 against the expected $1.90, and revenue reached $22.09 billion, surpassing the anticipated $21.09 billion. Net income increased by 15% to $3.8 billion, and revenue grew by 9%, fueled by strong performances in services, banking, and markets. Citigroup is currently in the process of selling a 25% stake in its Mexico business, Banamex, prior to a public stock offering, which contributed to a 9% increase in expenses last quarter. The bank's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year, rising more than 37%.</p>

          <p>China's new restrictions on rare earth exports could significantly disrupt the U.S. defense industry, granting China leverage in trade negotiations. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce announced that it will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, marking the first time China has specifically targeted the defense sector. Rare earth magnets are essential components in U.S. weapons systems, and the U.S. relies on China for about 70% of its rare earth imports. The Trump administration is working to develop a domestic supply chain, but the restrictions could reignite the trade war between China and the U.S. after a period of relative calm.</p>

          <p>Iran has sentenced two French citizens to lengthy prison terms on charges including espionage on behalf of France and Israel. Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, detained since May 2022, received sentences for spying, conspiracy against national security, and assisting Israeli intelligence. France has maintained that their detention is arbitrary and complained about the lack of proper consular access, while Iran seeks the release of an Iranian student detained in France on terrorism-related charges. The sentences are concurrent, meaning each prisoner will serve the longest sentence if they all stand, but the verdicts can be appealed.</p>

          <h2>Experts Predict Homebuyer Market Shifts Due to Falling Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 10:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that falling mortgage rates will lead to increased competition among homebuyers and potentially higher home prices. As mortgage rates decline, more people will qualify for higher loan amounts, intensifying competition in the housing market. While lower rates could make homeownership more accessible, any savings may be offset by rising home prices due to increased demand. Additionally, lenders may experience slower processing times due to a surge in mortgage applications, which could delay closing times and impact rate locks, however, the inventory is still relatively low, therefore it is still a good time to buy a home if you can afford it.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of attempting to weaken the global economy through export controls on vital technology resources. In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent stated that China's actions over rare earths and minerals are aimed at "pulling everyone else down with them." This accusation comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and threatened to cancel the meeting, leading to market volatility.</p>

          <p>An asylum seeker from Sudan is on trial for allegedly murdering a hotel worker in a "vicious and frenzied attack" at a train station platform. The prosecution alleges that Deng Majek stabbed 27-year-old Rhiannon Whyte 23 times with a screwdriver, resulting in her death. CCTV footage reportedly shows Majek staring at Whyte before following her from the hotel to the railway station. The prosecution claims Majek was "clearly excited about what he had done" and was seen dancing and laughing shortly after the incident.</p>

          <p>The US government has revoked the visas of at least 50 Mexican politicians and government officials as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on drug cartels. The move targets individuals suspected of having ties to organized crime and marks a significant expansion of US anti-narcotics efforts. The visa revocations threaten to complicate the already strained relationship between the US and Mexico, particularly amid trade negotiations and security talks. The US does not need to provide explanations for revoking someone’s visa and the threshold for doing so is much lower than for imposing sanctions or a prosecution.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court sentenced Masanori Aoki, 34, to death for the murder of four people, including two police officers. Aoki fatally stabbed two women in Nagano prefecture in 2023 and then shot and killed two police officers who responded to the scene. The court rejected the defense's argument that Aoki suffered from delusional disorder and schizophrenia, ruling that he acted with a strong intent to kill. The case marks the first time in over 30 years that multiple police officers have been killed by gun violence in Japan.</p>

The defense argues that the police lacked justification for using coercive powers, while the prosecution maintains the stop was lawful. Judgment in the trial has been delayed until November 4.</p>

Jahn had begun wearing cotton gloves and practiced target shooting before the attack, in which he killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life. Records reveal that Jahn was unemployed, friendless, and obsessed with artificial intelligence, having withdrawn into computer games at his parents' home. The records offer no clear motive for the attack.</p>
