          <p>A shooting occurred at Crosspointe Church in Wayne, Michigan, during a Sunday morning service, resulting in one injury and the death of the suspect. According to authorities, the suspect opened fire on the congregation, and a security guard at the church responded by shooting and killing the gunman. A church member reportedly used a truck to try and stop the shooter, which allowed the security guard time to respond to the situation. The FBI is monitoring the attack and providing assistance and investigative support. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is prepared to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Rubio emphasized that the strikes were aimed at degrading Iran's nuclear weaponization capabilities and not an attack on the Iranian people or a regime change effort. He cautioned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil transit route, deeming such action "suicidal" due to the potential global backlash. Rubio also affirmed the U.S. commitment to defending its interests and personnel in the region. </p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil trade route. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports and urged Beijing to address the matter with Iran. Iran's foreign minister warned that the country reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites, while Iranian media reported parliamentary support for closing the strait. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could significantly impact the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. </p>

The author argues that this practice undermines the authority of law enforcement, potentially violates civil rights, and endangers public safety.

The author calls for Congress to prohibit the use of masks by immigration agents, emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency in law enforcement. </p>

          <p>The United States entered the Israel-Iran war by launching a series of bombings on key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, marking a critical escalation in the Middle East. President Trump confirmed that US forces carried out attacks on Iran's Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities. The Pentagon confirmed that seven B-2 Spirit bombers launched the attacks from a US Air Force base in Missouri. While Trump claimed the attacks were a spectacular military success, the extent of the damage is yet to be independently verified, and concerns about potential radiation leaks remain. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, the National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States." The bulletin does not note any current specific threats but cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks and possible actions by violent extremists. It highlights that U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots since 2020 and warns that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate attacks. Law enforcement in New York City are deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution. </p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, is facing a precarious diplomatic situation regarding Iran after the US airstrikes. Despite his calls for de-escalation, the White House proceeded with military action, challenging Starmer's efforts to maintain a solid relationship with President Trump. While the UK was given advanced warning of the US action, it was not asked to participate, possibly due to legal concerns. The situation may require further difficult decisions for the Prime Minister if the US requests military support from the UK in the coming weeks. </p>

          <p>Based on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, certain phrases can instantly make children refuse to listen. Instead of using threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, parents can use language that encourages cooperation. Avoiding phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can improve communication. Instead, parents can explain their reasoning, give children agency over their behavior, and validate their emotions to foster a more cooperative environment. </p>
