          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Rates Amid Tariff Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 16:28:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady, acknowledging the uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs. Chairman Jerome Powell expressed that it's unclear what the bank should do next, as tariffs pose risks of both economic slowdown and faster price rises. The decision marks the third consecutive meeting without action, keeping the key lending rate around 4.3%. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates, but the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach due to the complicated economic outlook and the potential for conflicting goals regarding inflation and unemployment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he wants to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S., which came after a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who presented a plan to "rescue" the American film industry with federal tax incentives. Trump later appeared to hedge on his initial plan, saying he wants to meet with entertainment business leaders to ensure they're happy with his plan to bring back movie jobs. The announcement has led to speculation in the film industry and caused stock shares of major entertainment companies to dip briefly, though some labor unions have applauded the idea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged, acknowledging heightened uncertainty about the impact of President Trump’s tariffs on inflation and economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is well-positioned to respond to potential economic developments but cannot yet determine the appropriate course of action. The Fed acknowledged a solid labor market but noted increased risks of higher unemployment and inflation. This decision reflects the complexities the central bank faces in balancing its dual mandate amid volatile economic conditions and political pressures, as the Fed monitors the situation before deciding whether to cut or hike rates.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressing concern that cuts to the agency could severely impact the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlighted that American Indians and Alaska Natives are a particularly vulnerable population, with lower life expectancies and disproportionately affected by health issues. They urged the secretary to ensure that IHS programs have the necessary resources and staffing to fulfill their missions, and to halt any further actions affecting Tribal health care delivery without meaningful Tribal consultation.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the US ambassador to address a report that Washington's spy agencies have been told to focus on Greenland amid Donald Trump's threats to take over the island. The report in The Wall Street Journal indicated that US spy agencies were told to focus efforts on the semi-autonomous country's independence movement, and American goals to extract mineral resources there. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) declined to comment on the article, but told Danish media that it had "naturally" taken note of US interest in Greenland.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband's inauguration 108 days ago, raising questions about her role as First Lady. The corner of the residence typically used by first ladies remains dark, and she frequently vanishes from view for weeks at a time, holing up in Trump Tower in Manhattan or in Florida. While administration officials claim she is at the White House more often than the public knows, they have not provided specific details, leading to comparisons with Greta Garbo.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares rose on Wednesday following a report that the Trump administration plans to rescind the "AI diffusion" rule, which restricts chip exports. The rule, proposed in the last days of the Biden administration, organizes countries into different tiers with varying restrictions on shipping advanced AI chips. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the rule, with Nvidia's CEO stating that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would be a "tremendous loss." AMD's CEO has said the U.S. should strike a balance between restricting access to chips for national security and providing access to boost the American chip industry.</p>

The jury deliberated for over eight hours before reaching the verdict, which was met with outrage by Nichols' family and civil rights advocates, who called it a miscarriage of justice. The trial focused on the actions of each officer during the incident, with defense attorneys arguing that their actions were justified given Nichols' resistance and the circumstances.</p>

Researchers suggest that certain additives in ultraprocessed foods or chemicals in their packaging may cause inflammation or cell damage that harms brain cells.

The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, said at least 2,545 people have been killed since Israel resumed its campaign after a two-month ceasefire collapsed on March 18, bringing the war's overall death toll in Gaza to 52,653.</p>

          <p>The CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, has outlined several steps the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to take to address ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Kirby suggests limiting the airport to 48 flights per hour during construction, returning the airport to a Level 3 slot-controlled airport, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing air traffic control. The FAA says it's installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiberoptic wires, standing up a backup system, and boosting controller staffing to address the issues.</p>

Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court. It also boosts Democrats' chances of winning back the majority of the seven-justice court in 2028.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group was sued for allegedly concealing how backlash from the killing of a top executive was damaging its business, causing its stock to nosedive after the insurer lowered its 2025 outlook. Shareholders said the insurer defrauded them after the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare Chief Executive Brian Thompson by shifting away from strategies that led to higher-than-average claims denials, without revealing the impact on profitability. Luigi Mangione has pleaded not guilty to murdering Thompson in midtown Manhattan, and could face the death penalty. Mangione has become a hero to some Americans who are unhappy with for-profit health insurers that deny coverage for treatments.</p>

While some hope for a return to the old order after Trump, others advocate for closer cooperation based on a new realpolitik calculus.

          <p>Debt forgiveness can provide relief for those struggling with debt, but it doesn't apply to all types of debt. Credit card debt, medical debt, and unsecured personal loans may be eligible for forgiveness through debt settlement, while federal student loans, tax debt, and court-ordered child support are typically not. Secured debt like mortgages and car loans are also less likely to be forgiven.
