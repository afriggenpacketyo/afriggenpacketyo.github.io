          <p>President Trump has escalated a legal battle over executive power by asking the Supreme Court to permit the firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. Lower courts previously ruled her termination was illegal, stating that commissioners can only be removed for specific cause, and consequently ordered her reinstatement. The White House is arguing that the President possesses the authority to remove the heads of executive agencies and is seeking to suspend her return to the FTC while the appeal is considered.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has paused a lower court's order that would have shut down a controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." This ruling permits the site to continue its operations while a lawsuit from environmental groups and a Native American tribe proceeds through the legal system. The court determined that the state and federal governments are likely to succeed in arguing the facility is not subject to federal environmental reviews, a decision praised by the DHS and Florida's governor.</p>

This proposal marks the most significant rollback of vaccine regulations in the U.S., challenging long-standing policies designed to maintain herd immunity and protect vulnerable populations. The decision arrives amid a national trend of increasing non-medical vaccine exemptions and declining overall vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>A brand-new, $1 million luxury yacht named Dolce Vento sank within minutes of its inaugural launch in the Black Sea off the coast of Turkey. Dramatic video footage captured the 85-foot vessel listing dangerously to one side before it quickly took on water, compelling terrified passengers and crew to jump overboard into the sea. The Turkish Coast Guard responded to the scene, and an investigation is now underway to determine if a construction flaw, a balance issue, or human error was responsible for the sudden capsizing.</p>

          <p>A formal investigation has been initiated after a carriage on Lisbon's historic Glória funicular railway derailed and crashed, a tragedy that resulted in 16 fatalities and 23 injuries. The incident, which took place near a central city boulevard, has prompted serious questions about the safety of the iconic transport system, although the operator has maintained that all maintenance protocols were strictly followed. The system operates with two carriages, using the weight of the descending car to assist the ascending one, and a potential cable fault is now being examined as a possible cause of the failure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly initiated a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook concerning allegations of mortgage fraud. This inquiry comes after President Trump's attempt to dismiss Cook last month based on unconfirmed claims that she had misrepresented her primary residence on financial documents, which she has denied. Cook is currently pursuing a lawsuit against the administration, asserting that her removal was unconstitutional and compromises the independence of the Federal Reserve, while her legal team suggests the investigation is politically motivated.</p>
