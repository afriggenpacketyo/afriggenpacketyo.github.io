          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska on August 15 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting, confirmed by the Kremlin, aims to accelerate a peace process, with Trump hoping to secure at least a ceasefire and arrange a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Key negotiating points include Ukraine's potential NATO membership, which Russia staunchly opposes, and the status of Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russian forces. Neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian leader has yet agreed to a three-way meeting.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, the Red Roses, is preparing for a crucial match against France, viewing it as a key step toward their goal of winning the Women's Rugby World Cup. Wing Abby Dow described the team's journey as climbing "Everest," a metaphor reinforced by a talk from a mountaineer who summited the peak. The team is focused on learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over France, where they nearly lost a significant lead. Coach John Mitchell has emphasized that performance is the priority over extending their 26-match winning streak.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer and a suspected gunman were killed following a shooting incident near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The officer, David Rose, was fatally shot while responding to reports of gunfire and was later pronounced dead at a hospital, leaving behind a pregnant wife and two children. The suspect was subsequently found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Although no civilians were shot, the suspect fired multiple rounds at a CDC building, prompting a lockdown but causing no harm to the 92 children in a campus daycare.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has expanded to nearly 5,400 acres, forcing evacuation orders for thousands of residents near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The fire, which ignited Thursday, was 28% contained by Friday evening, allowing some evacuation orders to be reduced to warnings. One firefighter sustained major injuries when their truck rolled down a hillside during the response efforts. With temperatures forecast to exceed 100°F, authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant as crews continue to battle the blaze and several others active across the state.</p>

The game remained a tight duel until the fifth inning, when a two-run homer by Mookie Betts gave the Dodgers a lead they would not relinquish. The game showcased the enduring talent of both veteran aces, who are leading their respective first-place teams late in the season.</p>

          <p>A year after a massive landfill landslide in Kiteezi, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 220 homeless, residents are still living in fear and awaiting compensation. The disaster, triggered by a methane explosion, buried over 70 houses and highlighted the country's severe waste management challenges. While the Kiteezi landfill is now officially closed with Japanese assistance, Kampala's 2,000 daily tons of waste are being redirected to a new, controversial site in a forest reserve. The city authority has plans for recycling and biogas projects but currently lacks the necessary investment and funding to implement them effectively.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing discounted Russian crude oil, a move that complicates ongoing EU-India free trade negotiations. This action is part of the EU's 18th sanctions package against Russia, aimed at cutting off revenue for the war in Ukraine. However, experts suggest this single designation is largely symbolic and will not derail the trade talks. Paradoxically, the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of significant US tariffs, which may increase New Delhi's motivation to secure a stable trade agreement with the more predictable European bloc.

Food prices fell by 1.6 percent compared to the previous year, while service prices saw a modest 0.5 percent increase.

This unprecedented escalation in tactics has raised concerns in Mexico about potential U.S. incursions and unilateral military assaults. The move aligns with the Trump administration's priority of targeting drug-trafficking organizations, which it formally designated as foreign terrorist groups earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted two raids targeting day laborers at a Van Nuys Home Depot, raising questions about whether the actions violate a recent court order. The temporary restraining order, issued in July, prohibits agents in Southern and Central California from targeting individuals based on race or location without reasonable suspicion. Immigration advocates and Los Angeles officials argue these raids defy the court's ruling, while U.S. Border Patrol officials maintain their operations are targeted, legal, and based on intelligence regarding criminal activity. The matter has been appealed to the Supreme Court by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A fire that broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain has been successfully extinguished, averting a potential catastrophe. The blaze reportedly started in a chapel within the monument, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. Cordoba's mayor praised the "rapid and magnificent intervention" of the three fire teams that controlled and put out the flames. The building, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century and remains a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>Almond growers across Central California are grappling with a massive rat infestation that has spread across more than 100,000 acres of orchards, causing significant economic damage. The rodents are damaging trees by burrowing in root zones, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation equipment, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. According to a survey by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, some orchards have captured up to 32 rats per night. Growers are employing various costly and labor-intensive strategies to combat the pests, which threaten California's dominant position in global almond production.</p>

          <p>A Fremont man has been charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, valued at over $216,000, from a UCLA library in a sophisticated scheme. The suspect, Jeffrey Ying, allegedly used fake aliases and a system that did not require official ID to check out valuable books, some dating to the 13th century. According to an FBI affidavit, he would then return "dummy books" with mimicked labels in their place, presumably to sell the originals. Ying was arrested before an alleged attempt to flee to China, and authorities discovered blank manuscripts and fraudulent IDs in his hotel room.</p>

          <p>The political battle over Texas's congressional map has intensified, with California Democrats vowing to retaliate against a Republican-led redistricting effort. Dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block a vote on a new map sought by Donald Trump, prompting the Texas AG to sue to vacate their seats. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom hosted the absent lawmakers and announced a plan to advance a ballot measure that would redraw California's own map to "nullify" any Republican gains in Texas. This sets the stage for a contentious state-versus-state political showdown over control of the U.S. House.</p>

The Texas legislators left to block a Republican plan to redraw the state's congressional map, a move they argue would dilute the power of minority voters. In response, Newsom and California legislative leaders are preparing their own gerrymandering plan to neutralize any GOP gains in Texas, setting up a high-stakes political conflict.
