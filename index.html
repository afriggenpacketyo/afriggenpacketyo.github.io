          <p>A DW article reports on the environmental and human costs of rare earth mining in Myanmar's Kachin State. Activists describe the use of in-situ leaching, which involves injecting chemicals into the ground to extract rare earth minerals, as devastating to the environment and harmful to local villagers. The rare earth sludge contains numerous toxic chemicals that leak into the environment, causing breathing problems and skin conditions for workers. The mining is largely unregulated and is contributing to conflict and destruction in the region, with the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) now negotiating with Chinese producers on taxing the extraction. The article highlights that the demand for these minerals in products like electric vehicles and wind turbines necessitates responsible sourcing.</p>

Despite this, the article highlights some positive changes, including increased awareness of racism and bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver used on Floyd.
