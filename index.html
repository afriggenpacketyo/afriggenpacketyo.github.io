          <p>Chevron reported a significant drop in its second-quarter profits, with net income falling by about 44% to $2.49 billion. The decline is attributed to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the profit hit, the company's adjusted earnings per share and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations. Chevron anticipates the Hess deal will boost earnings starting in the fourth quarter and aims for $1 billion in cost reductions by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the death of her 79-year-old mother in a car crash, a woman in Cornwall is calling for an overhaul of the UK's "unsafe and inadequate" rules for older drivers. The current system relies on drivers over 70 to self-declare medical conditions affecting their ability to drive when renewing their license every three years. Citing a rise in older license holders and statistics showing they are overrepresented in serious collisions, advocates and safety experts are pushing for mandatory medical reporting by health professionals to improve road safety.</p>

          <p>Despite historically low approval ratings, an analysis suggests the Democratic Party's position may not be as dire as it appears, as disaffected but loyal voters are largely responsible for the negative polling. Factors like former President Trump's own unpopularity and the potential economic impact of his tariffs could benefit Democrats in the 2026 midterms. However, the party faces significant long-term challenges, including a weaker base compared to 2017 and formidable obstacles to regaining a Senate majority due to the electoral map's structure.</p>

The plaintiffs allege she breached a family agreement to establish trusts for them following their father's death.

          <p>Smoke from over 650 Canadian wildfires is blanketing the U.S. Midwest, creating dangerous air quality for millions in states like Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan. Air quality alerts are in effect across the region, with several major cities ranking among the worst globally for air pollution. Concurrently, the U.S. is facing separate weather threats, including a significant flood risk in the Carolinas and excessive rainfall warnings in Texas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having an emergency fund acts as a "security blanket" that helps protect long-term retirement savings. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take loans or hardship withdrawals from their retirement plans. This is particularly crucial for hourly workers, who face more income volatility and are more prone to tapping into their 401(k)s early. Financial experts advise automating small, regular contributions to a liquid, high-yield savings account to build this buffer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A historical analysis examines the systematic surveillance conducted by the Stasi, East Germany's Ministry for State Security, which employed around 90,000 full-time staff and up to 200,000 informal collaborators. The secret police force spied on citizens, read mail, wiretapped phones, and spread rumors to intimidate anyone perceived as an opponent of the Socialist Unity Party. Historian Philipp Springer's new book, featuring rare photos of Stasi officials, explores the motivations for joining, which ranged from a desire for power to seeking job security.

These relationships, while not reciprocal, can feel intensely personal due to the illusion of intimacy created by mass media and social media. The piece traces the history of this phenomenon from 19th-century "Lisztomania" to modern-day stan culture, noting how it can become toxic when fans overstep boundaries.

In 2001, state regulators proposed a rule requiring the removal of abandoned power lines, but it was weakened to allow utilities to decide when lines were "permanently abandoned." The line suspected of starting the Eaton fire had been inactive since 1971. Critics, including a former regulator, state that the utilities effectively rewrote the rules, prioritizing their interests over public safety.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the Democratic party's cultural messaging often alienates young male voters, pushing them toward the political right. Citing focus groups, the article suggests many men feel criticized and overlooked by a progressive culture they perceive as "anti-male." The author posits that this sentiment makes them receptive to figures like Donald Trump as an act of rebellion. To win back these voters, the author suggests Democrats should adopt a less scolding tone and offer policies that resonate with men's concerns, rather than dismissing them.</p>

          <p>Troy Lamar Fox, 34, has been sentenced to 358 years to life in prison for the murder of 17-year-old Briana Soto and the attempted murder of four other minors in Long Beach. Soto, a high school senior, was shot and killed near her home in March 2024 while walking home from her job. Two weeks later, Fox opened fire on a vehicle carrying four other young people, who survived. A jury found Fox guilty on multiple counts, and the lengthy sentence ensures he will not be free again.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have stated they will seek a prison sentence "substantially higher" than the previously estimated four-to-five years for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. In a court filing, they opposed his request for release on $50 million bail ahead of his October sentencing for two prostitution-related convictions. Prosecutors argue that Combs poses a danger to the community due to his history of violence and that the higher potential sentence increases his flight risk. Combs was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges in the same trial.</p>

          <p>A new tax provision signed into law by President Trump will allow filers who do not itemize to claim a charitable deduction starting in 2026. This new tax break is worth up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly, but it only applies to cash donations. Previously, only the 10% of filers who itemize could deduct charitable gifts. Financial experts suggest that taxpayers planning smaller year-end donations in 2025 might consider delaying them until January 2026 to take advantage of the new benefit. (not investment advice)</p>
