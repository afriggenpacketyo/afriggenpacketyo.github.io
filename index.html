          <p>Wu Yiquan, a 1.8-meter-tall AI researcher, has gained media attention in China for his impressive basketball skills. He recently scored 22 points in a provincial city league qualifier, showcasing his talent on the court. In an interview, Wu explained the parallels he sees between his work in scientific research and the strategic demands of basketball. He highlighted the unpredictability of the game as its most captivating feature, noting how it tests a player's ability to adapt in real-time, much like problem-solving in his field of AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Fox News survey indicates that American voter opinion on deportation is nuanced, depending on the circumstances of the undocumented immigrants. While a majority favor deportation in some form, only 30% support deporting all undocumented immigrants. A significant 60% of voters prefer deporting only those charged with crimes while allowing others a pathway to citizenship. The poll also reveals a partisan divide, with Republicans being far more likely to support deporting all undocumented immigrants, whereas most Democrats and independents favor the more selective approach.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a sailboat off Miami Beach has resulted in the deaths of two children, with two others remaining in critical condition. The sailboat, carrying five children and a counselor from a summer sailing program, sank after the impact. All six occupants were thrown into the water, prompting a large-scale rescue operation involving the U.S. Coast Guard and multiple local fire rescue units. The Miami Yacht Club confirmed the children were part of its youth program, and an investigation into the incident is currently underway.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially accepted a luxury jet from Qatar as an "unconditional donation," according to a memorandum of understanding. The agreement specifies that the Department of Defense can use or dispose of the aircraft at its discretion, with no stipulations for its use after the president leaves office. The cost to retrofit the opulent plane for presidential use is classified but has been speculated by lawmakers to be as high as $1 billion. This move has drawn criticism regarding the use of taxpayer funds for a gift that may have limited official use.</p>

The estimate does not include commercial properties or public infrastructure, which suffered hundreds of millions in additional damages.

          <p>Spirit Airlines has announced it will furlough 270 pilots this fall and demote 140 captains to first officers as it works to regain financial stability. The airline, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, is cutting its flight schedule to better align staffing with operational needs. The Air Line Pilots Association expressed dismay, noting that the airline's continued shrinkage erodes the value of pilot careers. The move comes as airlines across the industry report softer demand, particularly during off-peak travel periods, and Spirit takes steps to operate more efficiently and return to profitability.</p>

          <p>A political analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is attempting to divert public attention from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal by promoting claims of an Obama-era plot. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard recently asserted she had "irrefutable evidence" that the intelligence community's conclusion of Russian interference in the 2016 election was fabricated to harm Donald Trump. The article contends this is a dishonest distraction, pointing to the 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report that affirmed Russia's goal was to help the Trump campaign and undermine the U.S. democratic process.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against unidentified merchants for allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise on platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay. The lawsuit, filed in a Florida federal court, accuses the sellers of marketing "inferior imitations" of Trump-branded products, including t-shirts, hats, and mugs, without authorization. The company claims these actions cause consumer confusion and is seeking a court order to stop the merchants from using its trademarks.

          <p>The 4% rule is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting they can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings over 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. An annuity might offer a higher payout rate, providing protection against outliving one's savings, but often lacks the inflation adjustments and flexibility of a traditional portfolio. Financial experts suggest a hybrid approach, using annuities for essential expenses and investments for discretionary spending, can balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
