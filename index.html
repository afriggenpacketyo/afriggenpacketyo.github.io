Baby gear sold in the U.S. is particularly vulnerable to tariff impact because a large percentage of strollers and car seats are manufactured in China.

          <p>Following Britain, China has struck a trade deal with the U.S., President Donald Trump has announced, but the details of the agreement remain unclear. The EU has opted for a restrained approach, but US officials make clear it is back of the line. The EU was poised to hit back with significant countermeasures on everything from whiskey to motorcycles, but negotiations have stalled. The pressure to wrap up a deal is enormous.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis indicates that the Republican tax bill could reduce financial resources for the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year. The bill's tax breaks and spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid and food stamps, would disproportionately affect low-income individuals. The CBO found that the bill would increase government resources for the highest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $12,000 per year. The analysis could fuel criticism that the legislation favors the wealthy at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p>

The debate centers on whether Padilla's actions justified the response, with some defending his right to question officials about immigration enforcement.</p>
