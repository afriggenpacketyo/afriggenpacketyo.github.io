          <p>New images circulating on social media suggest that China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned. State media hinted at the ship's impending service by referencing a future era with three Chinese carriers. Satellite images reveal 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, exceeding the capacity of China's existing carriers, which suggests that the Fujian is preparing for commissioning. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests that the aircraft carrier will undergo trial service to test adaptability and coordination with aircraft and weapon systems, and further sea trials may occur before formal service later this year.</p>

Jimmy Swaggart, the founder of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and the Family Worship Center, gained national attention in 1988 for a scandal involving a sex worker, which led to his defrocking by the Assemblies of God, though he continued to preach and record gospel music.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating the involvement of two self-described "peacekeepers" in a fatal shooting that occurred at a "No Kings Day" protest. The incident took place when the two men confronted Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly pulled out a rifle, and one of the peacekeepers opened fire, killing Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo and wounding Gamboa. Authorities are determining whether the peacekeepers were authorized by protest organizers and whether the use of deadly force was lawful under Utah law, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his highly anticipated pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani pitched one inning against the San Diego Padres, allowing one run on two hits, and his form was not flawless, with rusty command and missed zones. The Dodgers had initially planned to wait until after the All-Star break to have Ohtani pitch, but his progress in live batting practice sessions and concerns about the toll of simulated sessions led to an earlier return. Ohtani is expected to serve as an opener once per week, gradually increasing his workload.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, arguing that such investigations are dehumanizing. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but allows it up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain circumstances, with approval from two doctors, and recent changes have allowed women to access abortion pills for home use under 10 weeks.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is increasing, with over 140,000 currently unhoused and projections estimating a near tripling by 2030. Factors contributing to this trend include the death of a spouse, job loss, eviction, and medical issues, and the aging homeless population faces complex chronic medical conditions that are not being adequately addressed. Experts note that the second half of the Baby Boomers generation, born between 1955 and 1964, has been at higher risk due to high unemployment and rising housing costs in their early adulthood. Healthcare systems are significantly impacted by this trend, as older homeless individuals often require hospitalization and nursing home care.</p>

The survey indicates that nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, and Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) is urging the government to prioritize the passage of the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing of nicotine pouches and their sale to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are small, tea-bag-like rectangles containing nicotine that are placed between the lip and gum, and while they are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.</p>

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on global arms exports to strengthen its defense sector. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has expressed interest in promoting defense exports, signaling a shift from catering solely to the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). This move is driven by the need to deepen ties with allies, improve interoperability, and develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons. By exporting arms, Japan aims to standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities with purchasing parties, which also allows it to achieve economies of scale and make domestic production more viable.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Donald Trump's megabill has sparked potential conflict with the House due to key differences in provisions related to state and local taxes (SALT), Medicaid, and the debt limit.

The Senate legislation proposes keeping the cap on state and local tax deductions at $10,000 a year, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually, and the Senate's bill also includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit, higher than the Houseâ€™s $4 trillion.

The bill, co-authored by state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse ArreguÃ­n, aims to increase transparency and accountability, especially in response to immigration raids by masked federal officers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has criticized the proposal as a threat to law enforcement officers, while Wiener likened masked ICE officials to Stormtroopers, and the proposal is being offered as an amendment to Senate Bill 627, a housing measure.</p>
