          <p>Despite China's criticism of Israel's recent attacks on Iran, Israel's ambassador to Beijing, Eli Belotserkovsky, stated that Israel is willing to "continue talking" to China. Belotserkovsky did not dismiss the possibility of China acting as a mediator in the conflict, but emphasized that Israel's primary concern remains its military operation. He highlighted the importance of Israel's relationship with China and the existence of open channels of communication between the two countries. The ambassador's comments come amid ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, with China maintaining a critical stance towards Israel's actions. </p>

          <p>An Iranian ballistic missile directly hit and damaged Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, southern Israel, prompting the evacuation of 20 patients according to Israeli officials. Dozens of ballistic missiles were launched at Israel, with projectile impacts reported in multiple locations in central Israel, and police and bomb disposal units were dispatched to the sites. Israeli officials have stated that they will continue to defend their people and will not stand by idly. This attack is part of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which has seen increased military actions in recent days. Optimism in the region is very low.</p>

          <h2>Passing Star Could Destabilize Solar System, Impacting Earth's Orbit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 01:32:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Icarus suggests that a passing star could cause more instability in the solar system than previously believed, potentially impacting the orbits of planets, including Earth. Computer simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system may underestimate the extent of future orbital changes of giant planets. The gravitational tug from a passing star could transform Pluto from a stable object to one with chaotic gravitational interactions, and the risk of instability for Mars could increase significantly. While the probability of a collision with Earth is relatively low at 0.2 percent, it is still higher than previous estimates, underscoring the vulnerability of the solar system to planetary chaos.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster, revealing remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London". The art also offers clues about the artists, with one fragment bearing the Latin word "Fecit," meaning "has made this." This discovery highlights the thriving settlement outside central Roman London and showcases the Romans' commitment to investing in the city. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick has intensified into a Category 3 storm as it approaches southern Mexico, with forecasts indicating landfall in Oaxaca or Guerrero. The National Hurricane Center warns of devastating damage from the storm's winds, with potential for major damage to homes, snapped trees, and widespread power outages. Erick is expected to produce 8 to 12 inches of rain, leading to life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in steep terrain. Dangerous storm surge is also anticipated, creating coastal flooding and large, destructive waves. The area impacted by Erick was previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in October 2023.</p>

          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan visited Hiroshima Prefecture to pay their respects to atomic bomb victims ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The imperial couple will offer flowers and a silent prayer at a cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, reflecting on the horrors of the 1945 atomic bombing. This marks their first trip to the city since the emperor's accession in 2019, and they will also visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and meet with survivors. The imperial family has a long history of commemorating the victims of the atomic bombings. </p>

He criticized the U.S. for restricting exports of competitive products like semiconductors while expecting a reduction in the trade deficit.

Head Park Sae-hwan worries about the circus's future, as it is the only one left in the country. The circus has adapted by offering only acrobatic performances and refraining from too-risky acts, with its acrobats now being Chinese due to a lack of South Korean interest.

          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government by strategically altering an item's materials, dimensions, or compositions. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit through these changes. Some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements to qualify for lower duties, while others remove elements based on tariff reversals. This practice is legal as long as goods are honestly presented to customs officers, and it involves strategic design choices to create different products subject to different tariff classifications.

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that tariffs will not help revive U.S. manufacturing, despite his company's acquisition of U.S. Steel. He believes that while the acquisition should help the U.S. economy, trade levies will not revitalize its manufacturing sector. Hashimoto's comments come as Nippon Steel finalizes a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary. He also noted that President Trump concluded it was necessary to utilize Nippon Steel's power to revive the U.S. steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>
