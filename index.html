          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has dismissed any possibility of renewed dialogue with South Korea and the United States. She refuted claims that North Korea was removing propaganda loudspeakers from the border, calling upcoming U.S.-South Korea military drills proof of their hostility. This firm rejection signals a hardening of Pyongyang's stance, with Kim stating the country has no intention of improving relations and will codify this position in its constitution. The two Koreas technically remain at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>

          <p>The national security trial of pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai is reaching its final stages in Hong Kong, with closing arguments delayed by a typhoon. The 77-year-old British citizen faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces under a Beijing-imposed law. Critics, including the UK government, view the trial as a key indicator of eroding freedoms and the weaponization of the legal system to silence dissent in the former British colony. Lai, founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, has been a prominent and vocal critic of the Chinese state for decades.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump has demanded a retraction from Hunter Biden for comments he made linking her to the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. In a recent interview, Biden alleged that Epstein had introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim her lawyer has labeled false, defamatory, and "extremely salacious." The lawyer's letter threatens a lawsuit if Biden does not retract the statements, claiming they have caused significant financial and reputational harm. The Trumps have consistently maintained they were introduced at a New York Fashion Week party in 1998 by a modeling agent.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed in Washington D.C. after President Trump took temporary control of the city's police force, citing "out of control" crime. The deployment, which includes 800 troops and 500 federal agents, was met with sharp criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called it an "authoritarian push." While the White House stated the operation is targeting violent criminals, official police data shows that violent crime in the city has actually fallen significantly in 2025 compared to previous years. The move has heightened political tensions between the federal government and the Democratic-led city.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a warning to travelers after a significant rise in cases of the chikungunya virus, with over 70 infections reported in the first half of the year. This figure is more than double the number from the same period last year, with nearly all cases linked to travel in the Indian Ocean region. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne illness can cause debilitating joint pain that may persist for years. Since the mosquitoes that spread the virus are not present in the UK, there is no risk of onward transmission, but travelers are urged to take precautions.</p>

The "Nakamal agreement" is seen as part of Australia's broader strategy to counter China's growing influence in the Pacific region. While full details were not disclosed, the deal is reported to include funding for data centers, climate change adaptation, and security enhancements for Vanuatu. Leaders from both countries hailed the pact as a "win-win" that deepens their relationship, describing their nations as "family" with a "shared destiny."</p>

          <p>A Breeze Airways flight from Virginia to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Grand Junction, Colorado, due to a disruptive passenger. According to authorities, the man became agitated, yelled racist slurs, and waved a skateboard at the crew. Flight attendants reportedly restrained the passenger twice, but he managed to break free both times, leading to a physical altercation that caused minor injuries to another passenger and a crew member. Upon landing, the individual was taken into custody by local police at the direction of the FBI. The incident adds to over 1,000 unruly passenger reports filed with the FAA in 2025.</p>

The funds in question, totaling nearly $10 billion, were designated for global health initiatives, including HIV/AIDS programs.

The virus is spread by ticks and fleas and is not transmissible to humans or other pets. While the growths are usually harmless to the rabbits unless they impede eating, the phenomenon is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope," a fabled rabbit with antelope antlers.</p>

Scientists have found that after ten consecutive dry days, vegetation becomes highly flammable, sharply increasing the risk of simultaneous fires that could overwhelm emergency services. They propose adopting the "firewave" term to better signal extreme fire danger in cities, reflecting the new reality of climate change impacts on urban environments.</p>

          <p>A passenger in the backseat of a two-seat F-15D Eagle fighter jet appears to have accidentally ejected from the aircraft while it was still on the ground at a Massachusetts Air National Guard base. A video circulating on social media shows the F-15 taxiing with its rear canopy missing and a puff of smoke visible from the back seat. The passenger, who was reportedly on an incentive flight, can be seen on the ground near the runway with a parachute. While such an ejection at zero altitude and zero airspeed is extremely rare and dangerous, the passenger appeared to be moving after the incident.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure, is a widespread practice, with 55% of business travelers admitting they have had loved ones join them on work trips. The trend is even more common among C-suite executives, at 73%. Motivations include saving money on personal travel and reclaiming family time that would otherwise be lost to work obligations. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a "policy grey zone," carefully separating expenses and being discreet about their companions to maintain a professional image. The global bleisure market is projected to grow substantially in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered that the assets of Infowars, the company of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, be turned over to a court-appointed receiver for liquidation. The proceeds will go toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment won by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. The order paves the way for the seizure of all company property, including cash, equipment, and the Infowars brand name itself, potentially ending Jones's long run. The families' lawyers praised the decision as a step toward accountability for Jones's cruel harassment and false claims that the 2012 massacre was a hoax.</p>

          <p>While overall food inflation was flat last month, prices for tariff-sensitive imports like coffee and tea are rising sharply, creating significant pressure for small businesses. The retail price for coffee jumped 14.5% year-over-year in July, and specialty importers are struggling to absorb the costs without passing them on to consumers. Business owners who rely on specific single-origin products from countries like India say they have no alternative sources and that the tariffs are devastating their slim margins. This article highlights how targeted trade policies can have a direct and painful impact on American small businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large study in Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) may offer wider life benefits beyond managing daily symptoms. The research, published in the BMJ, found that individuals taking ADHD medication had reduced first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. These issues are often linked to impulsivity and distraction, common symptoms of the disorder. Researchers believe the findings provide crucial evidence on the risks of not treating ADHD and could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about starting medication.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action (PAG) as a terrorist organization has led to mass arrests and a complex legal showdown. Over 700 people, many of them elderly, have been arrested for showing support for the banned group, creating a challenge for prosecutors. The ban was enacted after PAG engaged in what the government describes as millions of pounds in criminal damage against an Israeli defense firm, crossing the UK's broad legal definition of terrorism. The group's supporters argue the ban infringes on free speech, and the High Court will soon rule on whether the government's action was a proportionate response.</p>

HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts see this strategic shift as a way for Korean shipbuilders to enhance their competitive edge against their Chinese rivals, though it will take time to develop the necessary skilled labor.

          <p>The government of Nova Scotia, Canada, is facing criticism for implementing a sweeping ban on entering all wooded areas for activities like hiking and fishing due to extreme wildfire risk. The province, described as a "tinder box" after a long dry spell, has imposed a C$25,000 fine for violators, with 12 people already penalized. While officials defend the ban as a necessary precaution since most fires are human-caused, some critics, including a civil liberties group, have called the measure "draconian" and an example of "creeping authoritarianism." The restrictions will remain in place until significant rainfall mitigates the fire danger.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the bank-owned parent company of the payment network Zelle. The suit alleges that EWS knowingly launched the service with inadequate security safeguards, which allowed fraudsters to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims that Zelle's design, including a quick registration process and lack of verification, made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, which the company failed to address. A Zelle spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt," while the AG seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers.</p>

Spurs led 2-0 with only five minutes remaining, largely through an efficient, pragmatic approach and a clear focus on set-pieces, from which both their goals came. However, a late comeback from the European champions forced a penalty shootout, which PSG won, denying Tottenham the trophy. While the late collapse was concerning, the performance for the first 85 minutes suggested Frank's disciplined, flexible system could provide a strong foundation for the upcoming season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's 2016 legalization of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) has led to demand far exceeding predictions and forced clinicians into complex ethical territory. A feature in The Atlantic explores how the law, which prioritizes patient autonomy, has evolved, with some doctors questioning the boundaries of eligibility. For example, a disease can be deemed "incurable" if a patient simply refuses acceptable treatment, making them eligible for MAID. As the practice becomes more common and culturally accepted, providers are individually navigating the profound responsibility of a system where the right to die is enshrined before all of its logical conclusions have been fully reckoned with.</p>
