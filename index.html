          <p>Inspector Terrell Anderson of the New York Police Department was transferred after allegedly overriding negative psychological reports for 80 police candidates, allowing them to enter the Police Academy despite failing to meet mental health standards. The article states that the decision came amidst a department-wide struggle with hemorrhaging officers since 2020, with uniformed officers down from 40,000 in 2000 to 33,531 as of April 1. Anderson's union president defended his actions, claiming he had the authority to override psychological reports and was always transparent about his decisions. Anderson, who has a history of meritorious service, was known for his efforts to recruit more officers of color and improve community relations.</p>

          <p>The Senate is preparing to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The article reports that the waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and is prepared to sue if Congress proceeds, as 16 other states and D.C. have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>Californiaâ€™s e-bike incentive program, designed to lower transportation costs and reduce emissions, is working to resolve technical glitches that have plagued previous application rounds. The article states that a surge of applicants caused the program's website to malfunction, and a previous first-come, first-serve approach overwhelmed the system. The agency has rescheduled the second application window for May 29 and says this time itâ€™s ready for droves of prospective applicants. To avoid future problems, the California Air Resources Board and its partner Pedal Ahead hired Akamai Technologies, a cybersecurity and cloud computing company, and Queue-it, a company that manages website traffic congestion, to manage and host the virtual waiting room.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to the budget package containing his second-term agenda, as GOP leaders aim to vote on the bill despite wariness from fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans. The article reports that House Speaker Mike Johnson called the meeting "productive," though details of the final version of the legislation are yet to be unveiled. The president pressured members to fall in line, suggesting that any GOP member who doesn't back the bill would be "knocked out so fast." It is unclear whether there will be enough votes to pass the bill.</p>
