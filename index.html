        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a four-day strike, NJ Transit engineers approved a new deal, bringing an end to New Jersey's first rail strike in decades, with full train service expected to resume on Tuesday. The agreement, deemed fair and fiscally responsible by both NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri and BLET General Chairman Tom Haas, includes concessions related to work rules that will offset wage increases. While trains will not run on Monday to allow for safety checks and equipment repositioning, commuters are advised to work from home if possible, and NJ Transit rail tickets will be cross-honored on bus and light rail lines. The strike caused significant disruption, impacting over 100,000 daily riders and leading to crowded conditions on alternative transportation options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock futures experienced a downturn following Moody's Ratings' decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over widening federal deficits driven by higher interest payments, entitlement spending, and low tax revenue generation. The downgrade, while anticipated by some analysts, served as a reminder of the serious fiscal challenges facing the U.S. economy, compounded by ongoing tariff concerns and potential impacts from the reconciliation bill in Congress. As consumer confidence continues to slip amidst trade war-induced inflation fears, the market's reaction to Moody's announcement is expected to be more muted compared to previous downgrades in 2011 and 2023.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, a city heavily reliant on auto-parts manufacturing for vehicles destined for the United States. The tariffs have unleashed widespread anxiety, particularly among the smaller auto-parts plants that lack the financial stability of larger automakers, with estimates suggesting that over 12,000 parts workers have already been laid off. While automakers are unlikely to move entire assembly plants, there is growing concern that the tariffs will devastate parts makers, who are struggling with thin profit margins and uncertainty over the longevity of the tariffs. Despite the challenges, some companies are still planning upgrades, reflecting a degree of optimism amidst the chaos.</p>

Local government officials have expressed concern over the potential impact of closures on employment and the economy, emphasizing the importance of the plant's 60-year history and hoping for its restoration.</p>

The call follows the first direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in three years, although those meetings concluded without a ceasefire agreement, and is seen as a test for Trump's claims that he could quickly resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>With inflation persisting, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000 providing a safe investment option. While national average CD rates range from 1.69% to 2.00% APY, top CDs offer significantly higher returns, particularly from online banks, with short-term CDs (six months to one year) often providing the best rates. Investors can maximize their savings by considering short-term CDs and laddering their CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, ensuring they lock in competitive rates while saving for the long term.
