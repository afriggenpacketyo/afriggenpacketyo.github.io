          <p>China has stepped into a mediation role following deadly clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, urging both nations to exercise restraint and stabilize the situation. A Chinese official highlighted the long-standing tradition within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) of resolving disputes peacefully. The intervention comes after a significant escalation involving artillery and rocket fire along the shared border, which resulted in multiple casualties, including civilians.</p>

          <p>Displaced Palestinians in Gaza are confronting a severe hunger crisis, with daily life consumed by the search for food amid constant bombardment and shortages. International organizations like the World Health Organization and World Food Program have sounded the alarm, reporting that a significant portion of the population is starving and that malnutrition cases have tripled. Despite some aid entering the territory, the supply is critically insufficient, and accessing distribution points has become deadly, leaving many to feel they must choose between death by bombing or starvation.</p>

          <p>India is under intensified pressure to secure a trade deal with the United States before an August 1 deadline, after which tariffs are set to increase. Key sticking points include U.S. demands for greater market access for agricultural products, a sensitive sector for India's large farming population. Analysts suggest the U.S. is also motivated to finalize an agreement, viewing India as a strategic partner and a manufacturing alternative to counterbalance China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, attributing the decline to the significant impact of U.S. tariffs. The company now expects a lower operating return on sales and has revised its annual sales growth forecast downward. This reflects broader industry challenges for European carmakers, including robust competition and trade policy uncertainty, with VW assuming U.S. import tariffs will continue.

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have signed a new treaty, committing to a 50-year partnership under the AUKUS security pact to support their respective nuclear-powered submarine programs. The agreement is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and billions in British exports, reinforcing the trilateral alliance with the United States. This move solidifies the pact at a time of uncertainty over Washington's long-term role and growing concerns about China's military presence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a public disagreement during a visit to the Fed's headquarters to survey a major renovation project. Trump insisted the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, leading to a tense on-site exchange. Despite previously suggesting the project's cost overruns could be a fireable offense, Trump later said firing Powell was not necessary but reiterated his desire for lower interest rates.</p>
