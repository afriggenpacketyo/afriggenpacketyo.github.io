          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits surpassing expectations, driven by robust growth in wealth management and global markets. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, up from $1.91 billion in the same period last year. CEO Bill Winters highlighted the double-digit income growth in Wealth Solutions, Global Markets, and Global Banking as key factors. While the earnings do not fully reflect the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, the bank remains confident in its ability to improve returns through cost-saving initiatives and strategic growth areas.

          <p>China announced it is considering U.S. proposals to initiate trade negotiations, signaling a potential path toward resolving the ongoing trade war.

          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount due to a razor-thin margin of just four votes separating Reform UK and Labour. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. This election serves as Sir Keir Starmer's first major electoral test as prime minister. Early results showed Labour holding North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties, but Reform UK made significant gains, coming in a close second in those races.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, impacting U.S. customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These companies previously utilized the "de minimis" exemption, allowing them to ship low-value items (under $800) to the U.S. without duties or import taxes. The move aims to address concerns about damage to American businesses and the smuggling of illegal goods. Consumers are already seeing price increases, and analysts predict further cost increases as the exemption is eliminated.</p>

          <p>Detailed plans for a large military parade on Donald Trump's birthday have emerged, potentially involving thousands of soldiers, hundreds of tanks, and helicopters. The event, proposed to mark the US Army's 250th anniversary, would feature army bands, parachute jumps, historical vehicles, a concert, and fireworks. However, the plans have raised concerns about potential damage to Washington DC's roads and the high costs associated with moving military vehicles and accommodating personnel. Washington DC's mayor has warned that tanks rolling through the streets would not be good.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz while continuing as America's top diplomat. Waltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources suggest Trump respects Waltz, so he was given a soft landing and a high-profile new post, but some officials believe Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
