          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, plunging the region into near-zero visibility. The National Weather Service issued its first-ever dust storm warning for Chicago as a result of the event. Triggered by thunderstorms near Bloomington, Illinois, winds of up to 70 mph lifted dry soil from parched farmlands, creating a haboob. The article notes that the last significant dust storm to affect Chicago occurred during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, highlighting the unusual nature of this recent weather phenomenon. The storm created hazardous driving conditions and dramatic scenes across the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Andrew Fusek Peters, a photographer from Shropshire, has documented the beauty and diversity of wildlife in his back garden over a decade. The project, resulting in the book 'Garden Safari,' began after his diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, leading him to focus on the nature close to home. Using his kitchen as a hide, he has captured rare images of birds and insects, including a baby hare suckling its mother and birds displaying rainbow-effect wings. The book serves as a call to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens, emphasizing the importance of these habitats in the face of climate change.</p>

          <p>A recent survey conducted by Kyodo News indicates that 81% of Japanese citizens harbor feelings of unease rather than hope concerning U.S. President Donald Trump's second term. The primary reasons cited for this apprehension include concerns over the potential impact of tariffs on free trade and Trump's unpredictable behavior. Conversely, those expressing optimism point to Trump's perceived leadership qualities and his stance against China's growing influence. The survey also explores Japan's strategic alignment, revealing a near-equal split between prioritizing ties with the United States and maintaining balanced relations with both the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine but limited its use to older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This restriction contrasts with the broader approvals granted to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The decision also requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, potentially costing the company millions. Critics argue the FDA's decision, influenced by skepticism toward vaccines, could limit access for healthy individuals under 65 and reflects a departure from established norms, typically decided by CDC advisers.</p>
