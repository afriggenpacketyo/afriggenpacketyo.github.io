          <p>UK Homelessness Minister Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position following allegations of hypocrisy. The controversy arose after she increased the rent on a property she owns shortly after ending the tenants' contract to sell it, an action similar to what her department's Renters' Rights Bill aims to outlaw. In her resignation letter, Ali stated she followed all legal requirements but was stepping down to avoid being a distraction to the government's work. The move was welcomed by renters' rights groups and opposition politicians, who had called her position untenable.</p>

          <p>The United States and Europe are actively seeking alternatives to rare earth minerals to lessen their strategic dependence on China, which dominates the global supply chain. These materials are crucial for a wide range of products, from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to advanced defense systems. Recent price volatility and tightened export controls by Beijing on key rare earth elements and magnets have amplified concerns in Western nations. While the US accounts for a small fraction of global production, China's significant control presents ongoing challenges for international supply chains.</p>

While revenue of $998 million surpassed expectations, its adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents fell short of the 35 cents analysts had projected. The company reported strong user growth, with global monthly active users reaching 578 million, and noted that Gen Z now constitutes over half of its user base. Despite a positive sales forecast for the third quarter, Pinterest's finance chief mentioned lingering advertiser concerns about tariffs and market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its ambition to send astronauts to the moon, successfully completing a comprehensive test of its crewed lunar lander, Lanyue. The prototype underwent trials simulating lunar gravity and terrain to verify the integration of its landing, ascent, and control systems. This test marks a critical step towards China's goal of a crewed lunar landing before 2030. The Lanyue lander is designed to transport two astronauts and serve as their habitat and operational hub on the lunar surface.</p>

Attendees took to social media to complain about a lack of staff, long queues, and potentially unsafe conditions, with some describing the event as disorganized. Waterstones acknowledged an "unexpectedly high turnout" led to crowding but insisted the safety of attendees was never compromised.

The initiative, backed by a previous executive order, aims to support the local Metropolitan Police Department, enhance officer recruitment, and ensure compliance with federal laws. The White House stated the goal is to make the city safer for residents, lawmakers, and visitors alike.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, potentially adding five GOP seats, has ignited a national political conflict ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block the vote, while Republican leaders have threatened them with arrest. The move in Texas has prompted other states, such as California and New York, to consider their own redistricting efforts to counter potential Republican gains. This escalating "redistricting arms race" is occurring as the Supreme Court is set to re-examine key aspects of the Voting Rights Act.</p>

          <p>Southern California grocery chain Stater Bros. has reached a tentative three-year contract agreement with the union representing 12,000 of its workers, successfully averting a potential strike. The deal was announced after months of tense negotiations and a strike authorization vote by the workers. While specifics were not released, union officials confirmed the proposed contract includes wage increases, better pension and healthcare benefits, and improved safety protections. The agreement, which now awaits ratification by union members, follows recent layoffs and accusations of unfair labor practices by the union.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend approximately $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing President Trump's administration without committing to final iPhone assembly in the country. The announcement highlighted partnerships with long-term U.S. suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components, and a commitment to buy U.S.-made chips from TSMC's Arizona plant. This strategic announcement appeared to successfully deflect pressure regarding tariffs, as Trump subsequently announced an exemption for Apple on new chip tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
