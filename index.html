        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, the prosecutor in the Idaho student murders case, Bill Thompson, revealed that investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a second weapon being used by Bryan Kohberger. Some injuries on victim Kaylee Goncalves did not appear consistent with the primary knife, though it could not be confirmed. Thompson also speculated that Kohberger spared a surviving roommate because he likely panicked after spending more time and killing more people than planned, prompting him to flee the scene.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally stated it will not agree to disarm unless an independent and fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital is established. This declaration is a direct response to a key Israeli condition for any ceasefire agreement and remarks attributed to a U.S. envoy suggesting Hamas was willing to lay down its arms. The statement reinforces the group's long-held position and comes as indirect negotiations remain stalled and international pressure mounts for a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK's parliamentary standards commissioner is investigating Stourbridge MP Cat Eccles for potentially breaching rules by failing to declare a sponsored trip within the required 28-day period. The investigation centers on a trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories, valued at £2,600 and sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel, which took place in May but was not registered until July. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the delay to an administrative error and stated there was no intention to conceal the visit.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping order to close the U.S. asylum system, ruling that it cannot override laws protecting migrants from being sent to countries where they face torture or persecution. While the D.C. Circuit Court panel allowed the administration to continue denying discretionary asylum, it affirmed that migrants must be allowed to apply for mandatory protections like "withholding of removal." The ruling stems from a challenge to a proclamation issued by President Trump upon returning to office.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that agents cannot base detentions solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that such "roving patrols" by the Trump administration appeared to be unconstitutional racial profiling and lacked the required reasonable suspicion for a stop. The ruling is a victory for advocates who argued the sweeps instilled widespread fear and illegally targeted the region's large Latino community.</p>
