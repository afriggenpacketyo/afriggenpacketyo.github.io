          <p>Daniel Park, arrested in connection to the Palm Springs fertility center bombing that killed Guy Edward Bartkus and injured four others, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Park was awaiting trial on charges of Malicious Destruction of Property for allegedly supplying chemicals and explosive materials to Bartkus. The FBI classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism, motivated by a radical ideology known as "pro-mortalism," which views human reproduction as morally wrong, and prosecutors believed the clinic was targeted to destroy stored human embryos. Officials have not yet released Park's cause of death and are reviewing the incident. Optimism in this case is low given the deaths and ideological motivations of those involved.</p>

          <p>China is actively encouraging foreign institutions to adopt the yuan, aiming to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as confidence in the greenback diminishes. Recent initiatives include establishing a digital yuan internationalization center in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, the yuan has strengthened against it this year, and Beijing is expanding access to futures contracts for foreign investors and considering foreign currencies as collateral for yuan-settled trades. Despite these efforts, some analysts believe China's capital controls and geopolitical risks may hinder large-scale adoption of the yuan, however, these efforts are likely to have a long term impact.

          <p>Adrian Clouatre, a Marine Corps veteran, is struggling to care for his two young children after his wife, Paola, was detained by ICE during a green card application meeting. Paola, a Mexican national brought to the U.S. as a child, had an old deportation order due to her mother's missed hearing, which she was unaware of. Despite Marine Corps recruiters promoting enlistment as a path to immigration benefits for families, the Trump administration's policies have reduced discretion for military families, leading to deportations.

          <p>Data from ICE reveals that a majority of immigrants arrested in Los Angeles during a recent crackdown had no criminal convictions, raising concerns about racial profiling and the targeting of hardworking individuals. While the Trump administration claims to focus on criminals, data shows a growing percentage of arrests involve non-violent offenders or those with no criminal record. The sweeps have led to fear within immigrant communities, with families afraid to go out, and are straining the capacity of detention centers, but authorities say they are acting within the law. The shift in focus towards non-criminal immigrants is attributed to directives from White House officials.</p>

The White House disputes the findings, but the assessment raises concerns about Iran's residual nuclear capabilities and the potential for an accelerated weapons program.

          <p>ICE is holding a record 59,000 immigrant detainees, with nearly half lacking a criminal record, signaling an aggressive expansion of immigration arrests under the Trump administration.

The agency issued new safety recommendations to the FAA and Boeing to address the deficiencies, which both organizations have pledged to take seriously.

          <p>Thomas Lee Gudinas, convicted of the 1994 sexual assault and murder of Michelle McGrath, was executed in Florida, marking the seventh execution in the state this year. Gudinas's attorneys filed appeals arguing that his mental illnesses should exempt him from execution, but the courts rejected these claims. The execution is part of a broader trend of increased executions in the U.S., with 2025 on track to have the most executions since 2015. This reflects ongoing debates about capital punishment and the legal standards for mental illness in such cases.</p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past 50 years, yet recent progress in boosting vaccination rates has stalled or reversed in many places. A study in The Lancet found that measles vaccination rates dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, and several high-income countries saw declines in other key immunizations. Challenges such as conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation have hindered vaccination efforts, and changes in funding for vaccination initiatives add to the uncertainty. This has created a critical time for global vaccination efforts, but the numbers are expected to rise in the future.</p>

While officials emphasize community support and safeguards against unconstitutional use, critics express concerns about transparency and potential disproportionate deployment against communities of color.

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London is set to display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. Initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists discovered unique features in its bones, leading to its reclassification and its full name meaning puzzling runner. This labrador-sized dinosaur, with its long tail and large feet, is the first new dinosaur to be displayed at the museum since 2014. The discovery is expected to shed light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and their transition to larger forms.</p>

The science behind lab-grown meat involves growing cells in vats, but the process is energy-intensive, raising questions about its overall climate impact.

Examples such as Andrew Cuomo's mayoral run and Donald Trump's continued influence illustrate this trend, which is influenced by the public's view on sex scandals, the cognitive overload from multiple accusations, and the hyperpolarized political landscape. While scandals can still hurt a flawed politician, voters may be more willing to overlook them if they believe a candidate is more electable or if they strongly oppose their rival's worldview.</p>
