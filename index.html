          <p>European defense stocks experienced losses as global markets reacted to renewed hopes for a Ukraine ceasefire following US-Ukraine-European leader talks. The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index notably declined, with German and British contractors seeing significant falls. This market movement, influenced by speculation of a diplomatic breakthrough, occurred alongside higher-than-expected UK inflation and anticipation of Federal Reserve meeting minutes. The economic landscape presents a complex trade-off for central banks balancing price momentum and labor market conditions.</p>

          <p>China's economy is grappling with depressed social sentiment and a significant real estate slump, highlighted by a court ruling on national insurance enforcement and a record low jobs outlook. Despite a recent extension of the US-China trade truce, tariffs persist, and weak domestic demand is evident in declining bank loans and missed retail sales targets. While Premier Li Qiang acknowledges property market issues, some experts propose a 2 trillion yuan fund for real estate projects. Chinese companies are increasingly seeking overseas opportunities amidst these challenges, though the overall economic outlook remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's former transport minister, Andreas Scheuer, has been charged with making a false statement to the Bundestag. The accusation stems from his alleged deception regarding a contract for a highway toll scheme, despite knowing its likely illegality by the European Court of Justice. Scheuer, who served under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, denies the charges. This development highlights an ongoing legal and political controversy surrounding the unpopular toll proposal. The case is a significant event in German domestic politics.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in electric vehicle battery technology, with iron phosphate batteries, which are cobalt-free, gaining prominence, particularly in Chinese EVs. This development challenges the long-standing lead of cobalt-containing lithium batteries, a metal often associated with human rights concerns. The article highlights this trend, drawing from insights in Henry Sanderson's book, "Volt Rush: The Winners and Losers in the Race to Go Green." The disparity in adoption between China and the US raises questions about future EV battery strategies and supply chains.</p>

The move aims to enhance public safety by providing clearer information for consumers with potentially life-threatening food allergies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has vehemently criticized mail-in ballots, calling them "corrupt" and claiming they prevent honest elections. He asserted that he would issue an executive order to eliminate them, despite constitutional provisions granting states authority over election mechanics. Trump's current stance contrasts sharply with his support for mail-in voting in 2020. He also invoked former President Jimmy Carter's commission findings on potential voter fraud with absentee ballots. Critics suggest his actions aim to rile up his base, though the feasibility of his plans remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Superior Court has ordered the release of former President Alvaro Uribe from house arrest, pending his appeal of a 12-year conviction for witness tampering and bribery. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010 and led a hardline fight against rebels, was the first former Colombian president to be convicted of a crime. He denies the charges, calling the case politically motivated. The court ruled he does not pose a flight risk, granting him freedom until a final decision in mid-October, a development he welcomed as a chance to dedicate himself to Colombia's freedom.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has downplayed the prospect of an immediate summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite Donald Trump's renewed calls for direct talks. Trump, following meetings with both leaders, acknowledged Putin might not be interested in a deal, but suggested they meet first, with him joining later if necessary. While Putin expressed openness, his foreign minister emphasized gradual preparation. European leaders and Zelenskyy support the idea of bilateral talks, hoping to encourage a firmer stance from Trump if Russia remains unwilling to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>Asian markets experienced a downturn, tracking declines on Wall Street, as investors reacted to Japan's trade data and China's loan prime rate decision. Japan's exports notably fell by 2.6% year-over-year in July, marking their sharpest decline in over four years. Major indices across Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan all registered losses, with SoftBank Group shares plunging significantly. This broad market slump reflects global economic pressures and specific regional factors, including a third consecutive month of steady lending rates in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent diplomatic engagements, particularly his summit with Vladimir Putin, have paradoxically served to unify European leaders regarding Ukraine policy. A rare seven-member European delegation, including NATO and EU representatives, presented a united front in Washington, emphasizing the need for iron-clad security guarantees for Kyiv. This collective response, prompted by concerns over Trump's approach, demonstrates a convergence of European positions on a crisis that previously saw divisions. The unity, while born from a perceived threat, is shaping Europe's collective identity and pushing towards a concrete, albeit potentially suboptimal, peace framework for Ukraine.</p>

This modification was made in response to "new domestic regulations and evolving claims over foreign territorial sea baselines," according to Chinese engineers. The adjustment aimed to avoid waters considered by Manila to be under its jurisdiction, demonstrating how international maritime claims can influence space missions.

          <p>The Trump administration, through Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. officials. Gabbard accused them of politicizing intelligence, leaking classified information, or violating tradecraft standards, though no evidence was provided. Many targeted officials had worked on investigations that angered President Trump, such as Russian interference in the 2016 election. Critics condemn the action as unlawful and unconstitutional, fearing it will suppress dissenting voices within the intelligence community and undermine national security.</p>

For the Kremlin, Donbas is crucial for maintaining a land connection to Crimea and denying Ukraine access to the Sea of Azov.

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly employing tariffs as a political weapon rather than a traditional economic tool, effectively replacing diplomacy. This trend is evident in heightened tariffs against India, linked to its oil purchases from Russia, and Canada, tied to Palestinian statehood recognition. Experts argue this approach, termed "national security tariffs" by some, aims to compel loyalty to the U.S. and realign global powers. Critics suggest it could push countries like India closer to China, while the simultaneous dismantling of U.S. diplomatic instruments leaves the administration with limited foreign policy tools.</p>
