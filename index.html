          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois, preparing for assignments to protect federal immigration facilities and agents, a move ordered by the Trump administration. This deployment faces strong opposition and legal challenges from Illinois state and Chicago city leaders, who allege an aggressive federal overreach and a lack of communication regarding the troops' mission. A federal court hearing is scheduled to rule on efforts to block the deployment, while local officials express concerns about public safety and the National Guard's policing authority. The article highlights the political theater surrounding "Operation Midway Blitz" and the broader immigration enforcement debate.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has developed in the central Atlantic, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate Jerry will strengthen into a hurricane within a day, though it is currently far from land. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several Caribbean islands, which are expected to experience life-threatening surf, rip currents, and potential flash flooding from the storm's swells and rainfall. This article notes that while this season has been relatively quiet, Jerry follows other significant systems like Hurricanes Humberto and Imelda, which caused coastal damage in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has strengthened to a Category 2 storm off Mexico's west coast, bringing heavy rains and gusty winds to Baja California Sur. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph, is expected to move parallel to the coast, remaining offshore, but will cause dangerous swells, life-threatening surf, and rip currents. While weakening is anticipated later in the week, moisture from Priscilla could bring heavy rainfall and flash flood risks to the U.S. Desert Southwest.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the National League Division Series, opting for Blake Treinen despite a save situation. The choice was driven by a desire to manage Sasaki's workload, as he had recently returned from injury and pitched frequently. Although the strategy nearly backfired, Sasaki ultimately secured the final out. Roberts confirmed that Sasaki is now the primary option for future save opportunities, but the team will continue to carefully balance his usage given his limited relief experience and the demands of the postseason.</p>

          <p>U.S. air travelers are experiencing ongoing flight delays and cancellations due to worsening air traffic controller shortages caused by the government shutdown. Key airports, including Nashville, Dallas, Chicago, and Newark, are significantly affected, with some facilities operating at extremely limited staffing. Controllers, deemed essential workers, are working without pay, leading to increased sick calls and stress. This article highlights union warnings about fatigue and the potential for safety compromises, drawing parallels to a 2019 shutdown that similarly disrupted air travel and eventually prompted a resolution.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is seeking expanded Chinese investment in its transportation infrastructure, particularly for high-speed rail and new urban subway projects, following the success of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway on Java. The China Railway Construction Corporation is already involved in a $20 million Bali Urban Subway. While millions have used the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed line, the article also implicitly raises questions about potential debt implications of such extensive foreign-backed infrastructure development.

          <p>Tesla has introduced "affordable" versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in the U.S., priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively. CEO Elon Musk had previously hinted at a sub-$30,000 EV, leading to investor disappointment that the new models are only slightly cheaper than existing trims. The move aims to boost sales amid rising competition and the loss of a $7,500 U.S. tax credit. This article highlights concerns that the pricing may not attract a new class of buyers or sufficiently compete with lower-cost Chinese EVs, despite offering over 300 miles of range.

          <p>This article explains the Insurrection Act, a U.S. federal law that grants the president power to deploy military forces domestically to quell uprisings, often invoked as an exception to prohibitions on military involvement in civilian law enforcement. President Trump has threatened to use it to overcome state and court resistance to National Guard deployments related to immigration enforcement. Legal experts caution that invoking the act raises risks of troops using force and could precede more aggressive deployments. The article details the law's historical uses, controversies, and the limited judicial review typically applied to such presidential declarations.</p>

The move, intended to protect EU steelmakers from cheap imports and global overcapacity, could be the industry's "biggest crisis," according to UK Steel. With the EU being the UK's primary export destination for steel, the measures risk redirecting millions of tonnes of steel towards the UK market, potentially proving "terminal" for many companies.
