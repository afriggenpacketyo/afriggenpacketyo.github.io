        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is implementing another round of corporate layoffs, affecting less than 1% of its staff, as part of CEO Elliott Hill's strategy to refocus the business on sports and culture. This follows a larger restructuring in February that cut over 1,500 jobs. Hill aims to reverse declining sales and reignite innovation by shifting away from the previous "women's, men's, and kids" segmentation to "sport-obsessed teams," indicating a strategic pivot to drive future growth. The company anticipates sales and profit declines to moderate, suggesting the worst of its financial challenges may be over.</p>

          <p>An Italian online platform named Phica, known for displaying non-consensual photos of high-profile women including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has been forced to close. The site, which existed for at least two decades and had 200,000 users, featured images often altered with obscene tags and idealized violence against women. European Parliament member Alessandra Moretti filed a police complaint after finding her photo on the site, highlighting the prevalence of such platforms operating with impunity in Italy. Administrators cited "toxic behaviors" for the shutdown, as Italy continues to grapple with gender-based violence and legislative efforts to address it.</p>

          <p>Police have identified 23-year-old Robin Westman as the suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, which resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuries to 17 others. Westman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly had a "deranged obsession with previous mass shooters" and harbored hate towards various groups. Investigations are ongoing into the motive, including reviewing YouTube videos showing journals with weapon doodles, expletives, and references to killing. Westman, a former student at the school and whose mother worked at the church, legally purchased the weapons recently.</p>

          <p>The motive behind the Annunciation Catholic School shooting remains under investigation, though police confirm suspect Robin Westman, 23, previously attended the school and their mother worked in the parish. Authorities state Westman "harbored a whole lot of hate" and was obsessed with past mass shooters, aiming to cause "terror" for personal notoriety. The attack killed two children and injured 18, with the shooter barricading doors from outside to prevent escape. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey emphasized the need for gun control, stating prayers alone are insufficient to prevent such recurring tragedies.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, announced he was fired by the Trump administration, learning of his termination via email after an Amtrak event. Primus, nominated by Trump in 2020, plans to contest his removal, calling it "deeply troubling and legally invalid." The White House stated Primus "did not align with the President's America First agenda," intending to nominate "more qualified members." This firing is part of a series of high-profile ousters by the Trump administration, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and CDC Director Susan Monarez, raising questions about the independence of regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is facing a leadership crisis following the White House's attempt to oust newly sworn-in director Susan Monarez, who insists her termination is illegal. Four top officials, including the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and the chief medical officer, resigned in protest, citing concerns that science is being replaced by ideology and that scientists' data is being ignored. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the CDC of spreading "misinformation" during the pandemic and seeks "strong leadership" aligned with President Trump's agenda. This turmoil, including previous mass layoffs and changes to advisory committees, has demoralized staff and raised fears about the agency's ability to provide reliable public health guidance.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old woman in Kenai, Alaska, sustained serious injuries after being attacked by a bear near her home. The bear dragged her approximately 100 yards before she was found by a neighbor. Authorities, including Alaska Wildlife Troopers and the Department of Fish and Game, searched for the animal, believed to be a brown bear, but were unsuccessful. Residents in the area are advised to remain vigilant, supervise children and pets, and secure attractants. Bear attacks are relatively rare in Alaska, despite a large bear population, but this incident serves as a stark reminder of wildlife encounters.</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly staying in their current positions as the U.S. labor market cools, a new Bank of America Institute analysis indicates. The rate of job changes has declined significantly since its 2022 peak, now only slightly above 2019 levels, reflecting workers' nervousness about future job availability. This shift has also led to smaller pay raises for those who do switch employers, with the median raise dropping from 20% in 2022 to 7% in July. The deceleration in job mobility and wage growth could temper consumer spending, signaling a broader downshift in the economy.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert advises using email aliases for online shopping to protect privacy, reduce spam, and prevent companies from tracking online behavior. By creating unique, disposable email addresses for each website, users can disrupt tracking systems and identify which sites may have compromised their data if spam occurs. This method helps fragment one's digital identity, limiting the "blast radius" of data breaches and making it harder for attackers to link activities across multiple accounts. The article emphasizes that while password hygiene has improved, many still risk security by using a single email for all online interactions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to remove her from office briefly suggests that accusations of mortgage fraud may stem from a "clerical error." The complaint argues that even if a mistake occurred, it does not meet the "for cause" standard required for removal under the Federal Reserve Act, asserting the allegations are a pretext for Trump to stack the Fed Board. While the lawsuit avoids specific refutations of the claims, legal experts note this is common to avoid legitimizing the allegations.

          <h2>Reverse Mortgages Do Not Directly Affect Social Security or Medicare Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 14:25:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, designed for homeowners aged 62 and older, do not directly impact Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare eligibility. Social Security payments are based on earnings history, and Medicare is not means-tested, meaning assets or loan types do not alter qualification. However, the article clarifies that need-based programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid can be affected if large, unspent reverse mortgage proceeds exceed asset limits. Consulting a financial advisor is crucial for seniors relying on these supplementary benefits to structure payouts carefully and avoid unintended consequences.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, citing "consistently misrepresenting our policies." The ban, which includes BBC-funded local democracy reporters, stems from a disagreement over a story on local government reorganization. The newspaper's senior editor called the "unprecedented ban" a "direct attack on the free press" and its ability to hold elected officials accountable. Barton defended the move as upholding "responsibility and honesty" in journalism, while the Liberal Democrats urged Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to intervene, likening the action to Donald Trump's playbook.</p>

          <p>This article explores poetry as an enduring "analog solution" for mindful living, offering a deeper immersion in the present moment than modern wellness technologies. It highlights how poetry, through its focus on sensory details and internal experience, addresses the root cause of "unwellness" by helping readers reconnect with their lives. Referencing poet Linda Gregg, the article illustrates how poetry, like Gregg's "The Last Night in Mithymna," can evoke satisfaction and balance by subtly guiding the reader's awareness. This perspective suggests that engaging with poetry can cultivate a profound sense of self-awareness and contentment.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has agreed to pay $79 million to settle a federal lawsuit after a 2020 incident where it dumped 15,000 gallons of jet fuel onto a community in southeastern Los Angeles County, drenching dozens of children at a school. Delta Flight 89, en route to Shanghai, was forced to return to LAX due to a malfunction and jettisoned fuel over residential areas and multiple schools to reduce landing weight. The settlement allocates $50.6 million for victims after legal fees, with property owners receiving two-thirds and residents one-third. Delta agreed to the settlement without admitting liability, aiming to avoid trial expenses and distractions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's border advisor, Tom Homan, announced plans for increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles and other "sanctuary cities," with Chicago likely targeted next. Homan stated that operations would "ramp up" in cities refusing to cooperate with ICE, despite a federal judge's temporary restraining order against race-based roving raids in Southern California. The administration is considering a naval base near Chicago as a hub for potential enforcement actions. This initiative is part of what the Trump administration calls the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, with concerns raised over detainee transfers and overcrowding in facilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud has sparked a legal battle, raising untested questions about the "for cause" standard for removing Fed governors. Cook's lawsuit argues the allegations are a pretext to undermine the Fed's independence and that her actions do not meet the legal threshold for removal. Legal scholars are divided on what constitutes "cause" and whether the Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, will clarify presidential removal powers over independent agencies. This case could set a significant precedent for the Federal Reserve's autonomy and its ability to withstand political pressure.</p>

Public health officials previously deemed hydrogen sulfide a nuisance, but studies link chronic exposure to dizziness and depression.
