          <h2>Energy Bills Projected to Decrease in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 08:21:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual energy bills for typical households in England, Wales, and Scotland will decrease by £129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This nearly 7% decrease would bring the typical annual bill down to £1,720 from the current £1,849 for dual-fuel customers paying by direct debit, based on usage of 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year. While this reduction is a positive step, experts caution that prices remain significantly higher than historical levels, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability as international wholesale energy markets continue to fluctuate, necessitating policy action to upgrade homes at scale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated that he is leaning toward supporting only one interest rate cut this year, balancing potential upward pressures on inflation with worries about a recession. Bostic expressed concerns about rising inflation expectations following a consumer sentiment survey, despite the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to support maximum employment and stable prices. He noted that tariffs, which have fluctuated since President Trump took office, are economically significant and could contribute to inflationary pressures. While Bostic is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, his views offer insights into the central bank's considerations regarding monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating an aggressive form of the disease. While the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, with treatment options currently under review by the former president and his physicians. Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, prostate cancer experts note that survival rates have significantly improved, and patients with similar conditions can live for many years with proper treatment.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating that he does not need to buy rice because he receives so much of it from supporters, at a time when soaring rice prices have squeezed households. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising party, came as his ministry moved to release rice from emergency stockpiles to help curb prices that have roughly doubled from a year earlier due to a poor harvest. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba summoned Eto and urged him to retract the remarks, allowing him to remain as farm minister to ease the burden of rising rice prices on households. Rising rice prices have exacerbated the pain felt by consumers, who have had to contend with rising costs of other food items and energy.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity experts are warning that the United States remains dangerously exposed to various threats to its power grid, including electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks, sophisticated cyberattacks, and artificial intelligence (AI) threats. While EMP attacks, capable of disabling electronic devices across vast areas, pose a catastrophic potential, cyberattacks are considered more probable and still highly destructive. The rise of AI also presents a less understood threat, with concerns that malicious use of AI could bring down the grid entirely. Experts agree that the U.S. is not adequately prepared for these threats, emphasizing the need for improved cybersecurity measures and defense systems.</p>

          <p>China's central government has directed state institutions and ministries to purchase more domestic electric vehicles (EVs) to promote environmentally friendly automobiles for official use. While no specific target was mentioned, the move signals the government's backing for home-made EVs and aims to influence broader adoption. Official procurement accounts for a relatively small share of the national market, with the public sector making up only around 10% of auto sales. Beijing has promoted the purchase of electric vehicles by state institutions since 2017, with EVs required to account for at least 30% of total annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities and affiliated units nationwide.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's relationship with Qatar has undergone a significant transformation, shifting from condemnation to embrace, seemingly influenced by a lavish gift and Qatar's role as a global mediator. Trump, who previously criticized Qatar for funding terrorism and supported a blockade against the country, now praises its leaders and accepted a $400 million luxury jet donation. Qatar's role in brokering peace agreements and its strategic importance to the U.S. have contributed to Trump's changed perspective.

          <p>This article explores the historical evolution of male friendship, contrasting the passionate bonds celebrated in Renaissance Europe with contemporary depictions of men as emotionally reserved. During the Renaissance, male friendships were romanticized and considered superior to female friendships, with figures like Montaigne expressing profound affection for their male companions. Over time, societal views shifted, leading to the idealization of female friendships and the portrayal of male bonds as superficial or awkward. The article suggests reexamining emotional rules to foster more meaningful connections in an age of social fragmentation.</p>

In Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, secured a slot in a runoff against a nationalist historian, Karol Nawrocki, but the margin of victory was small, indicating strong support for hard-right candidates.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The statement noted that while this is a "more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management." The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians. Biden was evaluated after a small nodule was found in the prostate, which necessitated further evaluation, his office said last week.</p>

          <p>The Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh has evolved into a proxy fight between the progressive wing and the centrist old guard of the Democratic Party. Incumbent Mayor Ed Gainey, a progressive, faces a challenge from Corey O’Connor, the Allegheny County Controller and son of a former mayor, with the race drawing attention from outside political action groups. The candidates differ on housing policy and approaches to engaging with the city's powerful nonprofit institutions. The outcome of the primary is expected to determine the general election, reflecting broader ideological divisions within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulent trading, with investors selling U.S. stocks and bonds and the dollar, signaling concerns about the U.S. economy. A bill in Congress that would make President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, coupled with the United States’ loss of its last triple-A credit rating, has heightened worries about government debt. Raphael Bostic, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, noted that the Moody’s downgrade would “have implications for the cost of capital and a bunch of other things.” The combination of diminished appetite to buy U.S. assets and the rigidity of a U.S. fiscal process that locks in very high deficits is making the market nervous.</p>

          <p>President Trump will speak separately with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in hopes of ending the conflict in Ukraine. The call with Putin will take into account the outcome of negotiations carried out in Istanbul. Threats from Trump that Washington could withdraw from the diplomatic process in the absence of an imminent resolution have raised concerns that the White House might diminish its critical military and humanitarian support for Ukraine. Trump has recently turned tack on his reluctance to directly criticize Putin, increasingly levying the possibility of further sanctions on Moscow and backing a Ukraine and Europe-endorsed call for a 30-day ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Portugal’s governing center-right coalition won a snap election but failed to secure a majority amid a surge in votes for the hard-right Chega party. While the results are likely to produce little change in Portugal’s leadership, they cement the evolution of Chega from a onetime protest movement to a powerful political contender in a country that unlike others in Europe, had until recently largely shunned the hard right. The snap election — the third in as many years — was called after Portugal’s Parliament ousted the year-old center-right government in a vote of no confidence in March.</p>

          <p>Some federal student loan borrowers are experiencing significant credit score drops as loan servicers resume reporting delinquent accounts to credit bureaus after a nearly four-year pandemic pause. Borrowers who were unaware of their repayment obligations or unable to make payments are facing the consequences, with some reporting credit score declines of over 100 points. The resumption of wage garnishments for borrowers more than 270 days late on payments is expected to exacerbate the issue, highlighting the challenges borrowers face in navigating the student loan repayment process.</p>

Mount turned quickly onto a short pass from Leny Yoro and curled a shot from just inside the penalty area into the corner of the net. Everything just happened so quickly. I feel like it was a bit of like a flow state, I wasn't thinking much and then I scored two goals, and we win the game.</p>

          <p>A manhunt continues for seven inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail by fleeing through a hole behind a toilet, entering its fourth day on Monday, as officials increased the reward for the capture of the fugitives. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the escape was the worst in recent state history and said he is ordering an audit of the sheriff's office as well as the Orleans Parish Prison. The governor said that nine of the 10 escapees had been in the pretrial stages for years, and he wants the district attorney to explain the slow progress in prosecuting criminal cases in the city. One of the men who is still at large was identified as Derrick Groves, arrested for the shooting deaths of Jamar Robinson and Byron Jackson on Mardi Gras in 2018.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer banks on public being over Brexit, and that nobody really cares any more. The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union – but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense. If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU. But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.</p>

The regulations target white elephant projects, the use of official vehicles, lavish meals, and meeting venue decor. All officials should bear in mind that “it’s glorious to save and it’s shameful to waste”, the latest rules say, while urging the party and the government to demonstrate “strict diligence and thrift, and oppose extravagance and waste”. Analysts said the move reflected Beijing’s growing anxiety over the mounting debts incurred to finance its budget, and its aim to curb potential wasteful spending at various levels of government that had resulted in snowballing debt.</p>
