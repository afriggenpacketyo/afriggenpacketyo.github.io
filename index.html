          <p>Israel is significantly expanding its military offensive in Gaza City, calling up tens of thousands of army reservists to report for duty. The move has reportedly caused friction within Israel's Security Cabinet, with military leaders expressing concern over the risk to hostages and the army's resources. Separately, a human rights organization reported that a record 11,040 Palestinians are being held in Israeli detention, with more than half held without charge or trial under administrative detention or as "unlawful combatants."</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government after his 2022 election loss, facing charges that include plotting a coup and forming a criminal organization. The case is considered a pivotal test for Brazil's democratic institutions, which emerged from a military dictatorship just 40 years ago. The proceedings have drawn international attention, with former U.S. President Trump, a supporter of Bolsonaro, calling the trial a "witch hunt" and reportedly attempting to intervene.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, a decision that could force the government to repay billions. This prospect has raised concerns about the already-strained U.S. fiscal situation, potentially requiring a surge in Treasury issuance to cover the refunds. The market reaction reflects growing anxiety over sovereign risk and fiscal fragility, with investors also looking ahead to key jobs data for further economic signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A strong solar storm caused the Northern Lights to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom, from northern Scotland down to Kent. The phenomenon occurred after a coronal mass ejection from the sun sent increased solar energy into Earth's atmosphere, interacting with gases to create the vibrant colors. Space weather forecasters indicate the heightened solar activity may continue, creating the possibility for another aurora display, though viewing will be dependent on local cloud cover.</p>

          <p>The FBI's arrest of Bajun Mavalwalla II, a U.S. Army veteran, on federal conspiracy charges following a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has raised significant concerns among legal experts and fellow veterans. Mavalwalla was charged with "conspiracy to impede or injure officers," a move that critics argue represents a troubling escalation in the use of federal law to suppress First Amendment rights. The case is seen as part of a broader, aggressive strategy by the Trump administration to quell dissent against its immigration policies.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece warns that former President Trump's repeated attacks on the credibility of official government statistics, including data on jobs and crime, pose a serious threat to democracy. The author draws parallels to Soviet-era tactics, arguing that fostering public distrust in all data erodes the shared factual basis necessary for informed debate and holding power to account. This environment, the article contends, makes it easier for an authoritarian government to invent crises and justify actions without the possibility of a credible, data-driven public pushback.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has returned from its August recess to face a packed and contentious agenda, headlined by the urgent need to pass a funding bill by September 30 to avert a government shutdown. Partisan disagreements over spending levels make a temporary, short-term measure the most likely outcome. In addition to the funding fight, lawmakers are also expected to tackle potential changes to Senate nomination rules, a new crime bill, and growing bipartisan pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>Spending on political advertising for the 2025-2026 midterm election cycle is projected to reach a record-breaking $10.8 billion, marking a 20% increase over the 2022 cycle. According to a report by AdImpact, this surge is primarily fueled by a dramatic rise in spending on connected TV and streaming platforms, which is expected to hit $2.5 billion. The highly competitive nature of congressional races in key battleground states is driving the unprecedented level of expenditure. (not investment advice)</p>

The increasing popularity of the global game in the U.S., driven by media, immigration, and youth participation, is now globalizing American culture in a new and powerful way.</p>

          <p>As they release their tenth studio album, the British band Suede, widely credited with sparking the Britpop movement of the 1990s, reflects on its legacy and forward-looking creative drive. The article discusses how Suede's glamorous and complex portrayal of British life was eventually overshadowed by the more straightforward, "laddish" image of bands like Oasis and Blur. Despite the current wave of Britpop nostalgia, Suede's members maintain an "anti-nostalgia" position, focusing on creating new music rather than reliving their past.</p>

          <p>New research has identified a significant barrier to on-time college graduation: students are often unable to enroll in required courses for their majors when they need them. This scheduling problem forces students to extend their studies, increasing the time and cost of their degrees, and can even lead them to change majors or drop out entirely. The issue is expected to be exacerbated by ongoing budget cuts and faculty layoffs at many institutions, including within the California State University system.</p>
