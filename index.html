          <p>Following Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a physical altercation broke out on the field. The incident involved PSG's coach Luis Enrique and goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma shoving Chelsea forward João Pedro. This occurred just before U.S. President Donald Trump, who was in attendance, joined FIFA President Gianni Infantino for the awards ceremony. The match itself had been contentious, with six yellow cards and one red card issued, but the post-game fight was a notable disruption to the championship celebration.</p>

          <p>A small aircraft crashed at London Southend Airport, resulting in a large fire that witnesses described as a "huge fireball." The Dutch company Zeusch Aviation confirmed its flight was involved in the accident, which occurred as the plane was en route from Croatia. The airport has been closed indefinitely, and all Monday flights are canceled while authorities investigate the incident. While the number of casualties has not been officially confirmed, the dramatic witness accounts and scale of the emergency response suggest a serious and tragic event.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' expectations. This acceleration was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the strong performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. The positive GDP figures arrive ahead of an anticipated monetary policy decision, with recent low inflation numbers potentially supporting a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain was marked by a pre-match and halftime show that felt more akin to an American Super Bowl than a traditional European football final. The event at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium featured a military flyover, performances by Robbie Williams and Coldplay, and an on-pitch presence from U.S. President Donald Trump. This elaborate presentation, complete with a celebrity red carpet, delayed both the start of the game and the second half. The spectacle highlighted FIFA's effort to create a major global event.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending a new 50% tariff against Brazil, framing it as a necessary component of a global strategy to onshore production and reduce trade deficits for national security reasons. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the U.S. currently has a trade surplus with Brazil, but argued that a comprehensive strategy is needed to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term objectives. The justification was met with skepticism, as President Trump's letter to Brazil also linked the tariff to the criminal case against his political ally. (not investment advice)</p>
