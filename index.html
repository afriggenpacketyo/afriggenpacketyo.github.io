          <p>A University of Delaware graduate student was killed, and several others were injured when a driver fleeing from police struck pedestrians near the campus. Gordon Turner, the driver, was attempting to evade arrest for unauthorized use of a U-Haul truck and sped down Main Street, losing control and hitting multiple pedestrians and parked cars. The incident resulted in one death, serious injuries to another student, and non-life-threatening injuries to several others. Turner faces charges including second-degree murder and assault, and is also wanted in other states. The university president expressed condolences and emphasized campus safety.</p>

          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik of New York finds herself reassessing her political trajectory after her nomination as UN ambassador was withdrawn, leading to a strained relationship with Speaker Mike Johnson. Stefanik, who had prepared to leave her House seat, is now contemplating a run for New York governor in 2026. The article highlights the breakdown in trust between Stefanik and Johnson, particularly after Johnson allegedly made unfulfilled promises regarding a leadership position and committee assignments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The disappearance of a gray whale calf carcass off the coast of San Diego has puzzled divers and marine biologists, raising questions about the fate of the 18-foot-long, 2,000-pound body. The calf, which had been spotted searching for its mother near La Jolla Shores, was found deceased in Scripps Canyon at a shallow depth of 115 feet, attracting divers and underwater photojournalists. After a few weeks, the carcass vanished, leading to speculation about whether it was scavenged or moved by currents. Experts suggest that gas buildup during decomposition could have caused the carcass to refloat and be swept deeper into the canyon, highlighting the complex ecological processes surrounding whale falls and the challenges faced by gray whale populations due to climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that Americans might have to "do with less" as a result of the ongoing trade war with China.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Oklahoma's plan to use public funds for the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, with justices divided along ideological lines. The case centers on whether the First Amendment permits or requires states to fund religious charter schools. Republican appointees appeared sympathetic to the school, while Democratic ones expressed wariness. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, raising the possibility of a tie vote. The decision could affect laws in 46 other states that authorize charter schools and potentially blur the line between government support for private religious schools and direct government funding of religious institutions.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit is warning commuters of a potential shutdown of statewide rail service in mid-May due to strained negotiations with the union representing its train drivers. The agency has laid out a contingency plan involving bus substitutions, but warns that bus service can only accommodate a fraction of daily train riders. NJ Transit is advising customers to prepare to work from home if a strike occurs. Negotiations have resumed, but the agency chief executive expressed concern about the "chaos the union is intent on creating."</p>

          <p>Financial planners recommend keeping enough cash in a checking account to cover a month's worth of bills, plus a small buffer for peace of mind, but advise against hoarding too much cash in checking accounts due to missed interest earnings and potential fraud risks. It's better to transfer excess funds to high-yield savings accounts. The right checking balance is about headspace, allowing you to live without constantly double-checking your balance before making purchases.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to report its first-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching for signs that President Trump's tough China tariffs are affecting the company's online ads business. Analysts expect Meta's China-derived advertising business to feel the most pain from Trump's tariffs, as online retailers such as Temu and Shein are slashing their U.S. ad spending. Meta's 2025 advertising revenue could be affected by $7 billion if China-linked companies continue shrinking their digital ad spending due to the U.S.-China trade dispute. Investors will also be monitoring whether Trump's tariffs will affect Meta's big spending on artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown in early 2025 due to President Trump's tariffs, as consumers and businesses reacted to a constant stream of tariff announcements and policy shifts. U.S. gross domestic product declined at an 0.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, a reversal from the strong growth at the end of last year. While the negative number may be misleading due to quirks in economic measurement, it reflects the impact of Trump's policies. Economists widely expect spending and investment to slow in the months ahead, as tariffs drive up prices and uncertainty keeps businesses on hold.</p>

He also emphasized Google's investments in AI and the competitive landscape, highlighting that the company views its AI chatbot, Gemini, as a leading model but still behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. The DOJ has argued that Google's control of search gives an advantage to its AI products, and they are asking that Google be ordered to license its search data to other companies.</p>

Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies.

In a study, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City, fitted them with radio trackers and found that they survived and foraged successfully at both sites, even gaining weight. The researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland "refuges" for the axolotls, installing natural filtering systems to clean the water.</p>
