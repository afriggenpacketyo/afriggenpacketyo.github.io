          <p>Oracle's shares experienced an 8% increase in extended trading following the release of a report indicating earnings and revenue surpassing Wall Street's projections. Cloud infrastructure revenue is anticipated to rise by over 70% in fiscal year 2026, which is a significant increase from the 52% growth observed in the reported quarter. CEO Safra Catz forecasts over $67 billion in fiscal 2026 revenue, exceeding consensus estimates, and the company projects adjusted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.50 for the fiscal first quarter. Recent partnerships with Cleveland Clinic, G42, and IBM, along with Temu's infrastructure migration to Oracle's cloud, contribute to this positive outlook (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Larne Leisure Centre was attacked amidst a third night of violence in Northern Ireland, sparked by protests over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena. Masked youths threw objects at vehicles, causing damage to the leisure center's front reception and extensive smoke damage; staff barricaded themselves and fled. In Ballymena, police deployed dogs and water cannons to disperse crowds throwing smoke bombs and bricks. Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson condemned the violence as racist thuggery, noting the use of social media to galvanize the unrest and the pre-planning involved in attacks on police, while some residents displayed signs indicating their nationalities, and some families fled their homes due to the disorder. The situation highlights the complex social and political tensions in the region. The optimism score is not directly related to the events described.</p>

          <p>As the conflict in Ukraine continues, an opinion piece suggests that China holds the best chance for facilitating peace negotiations. With recent peace talks stalled and neither side able to achieve a decisive victory, the article argues that direct negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian leaders are necessary. While the U.S. and NATO have not been successful in brokering a ceasefire, China's potential involvement could provide a path forward. The establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong further underscores the need for effective conflict resolution mechanisms.</p>

The proposal would eliminate rules finalized during the Biden administration that required significant carbon dioxide pollution reductions from coal and natural gas plants, while the EPA also seeks to eliminate the 2009 endangerment finding that labeled greenhouse gasses a danger to public health.</p>

          <p>Huntington Park Mayor Arturo Flores, a Marine veteran, delivered a plea to Marines deployed to protests against anti-immigration raids in Los Angeles, reminding them of their oath to the American people, not a dictator. His comments came as over 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines were stationed in Los Angeles in response to protests sparked by ICE raids. Flores emphasized that the people in these communities are Americans, regardless of documentation status, and denounced the militarization of immigration enforcement. He criticized the Trump administration's actions as political theater rooted in fear.</p>

          <p>Images of burning vehicles and clashes during protests against federal immigration raids have painted a distorted picture of Los Angeles as a city out of control. President Trump and his supporters have used these images to condemn L.A., while state leaders and journalists argue Trump escalated the conflict by deploying the National Guard and Marines. A poll shows mixed feelings about the events, with many disapproving of both the administration's handling of deportations and the protests. Despite Trump's claims of Los Angeles being on fire, the reality is that the unrest was limited to a few neighborhoods, and many mocked claims of a widespread public safety crisis.</p>
