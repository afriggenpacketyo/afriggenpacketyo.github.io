          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with an impressive 3-0 victory over West Ham, securing their first top-flight win in August in over a decade. After a significant summer spending spree of around £132 million on new players, the team demonstrated strong cohesion and performance. Goals from Championship play-off heroes Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard, along with a late strike from Wilson Isidor, sealed the win. This strong start is seen as crucial for the newly promoted club's hopes of avoiding relegation, providing a significant boost to the team and its long-suffering fans.</p>

          <p>A rare wood stork, a species typically found in Gulf Coast states and Central America, was unexpectedly sighted in Columbia County, Wisconsin. The bird, listed as threatened, is believed to be a juvenile that got lost while exploring new territory, a common behavior for young storks. It was last seen flying northeast with a flock of pelicans. The sighting highlights the species' remarkable recovery from endangered status in the 1970s, with nesting pairs now exceeding 11,000, though conservationists warn that habitat destruction remains a significant threat to their long-term survival.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern Gaza Strip ahead of a renewed offensive targeting Hamas's final stronghold in Gaza City. The operation will involve resuming the supply of tents and shelter equipment through the Kerem Shalom crossing for distribution by the UN and aid organizations. Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed that discussions are underway to finalize the plan to defeat Hamas. The announcement has prompted groups representing hostage families to call for widespread protests, urging an agreement to end the war and secure the release of all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska for a summit described by Putin as "timely and very useful" for discussing a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. Putin stated that the conversation was frank and focused on eliminating the root causes of the crisis. During the summit, Trump reportedly delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump concerning Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. In a subsequent call with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump relayed Putin's demand that Ukraine withdraw from the entire Donetsk region in exchange for a halt to Russia's offensive in other areas.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, Marah Abu Zuhri, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation, has died from cardiac arrest. She passed away less than 48 hours after arriving in Pisa as part of an Italian government program to aid sick and injured Gazans. This tragic event highlights the severe malnutrition crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of a potential famine. While Israel denies the existence of starvation, Gaza's health ministry reports over 250 hunger-related deaths, underscoring the dire humanitarian situation as the conflict continues and displacement worsens.</p>

While the storm is expected to remain offshore, it poses a significant threat of large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from August 20 to 27. Tropical storm watches are in effect for several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico could experience heavy rain and flash flooding. A cold front moving off the U.S. coast is predicted to steer Erin out to sea, but coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, should prepare for potential erosion and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>West Virginia will deploy 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington, D.C., as part of the Trump administration's federal effort to address crime and homelessness in the city. This move follows President Trump's executive order to federalize local police and activate D.C. National Guard troops, tightening federal control over the capital. The administration justifies the intervention as an emergency response, though D.C. officials note that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term. The deployment has sparked protests and legal challenges from city leaders, who view it as an overreach of federal power.</p>

The renewed competition is compelling Apple to innovate, with expectations of a slimmer iPhone and a potential foldable model in the coming years.

The union, representing 10,000 flight attendants, accused the government of violating their right to strike and siding with the airline.

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised U.S. President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts, stating they have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine.

Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support for Ukraine. The statement highlights the alignment of Western allies in welcoming U.S. leadership to broker robust security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal.</p>

          <p>A Denver man was scammed out of $17,000 after his call to United Airlines' official customer service number was mysteriously transferred to a fraudster. While trying to rebook a canceled flight, Dan Smoker was connected to an agent who processed a new ticket and then levied a fraudulent $17,000 charge under a vague alias. Call logs confirm he dialed the correct number, but United's internal records show a much shorter call duration, and the airline cannot explain how the transfer occurred. The case highlights a sophisticated new type of scam where criminals may be intercepting calls within official corporate phone systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are strongly encouraging adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support heart health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol, raise 'good' HDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. These benefits are crucial for maintaining healthy blood vessel function and preserving muscle mass, including the heart muscle itself, as people age. Experts recommend consuming at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his bravery during an attack on a German U-boat in 1944 while piloting a Catalina flying boat. Despite suffering 72 separate injuries during the engagement, he successfully destroyed the submarine, an act of "determination, fortitude and devotion to duty." A former banker who left the RAF after the war, Flt Lt Cruickshank was remembered by friends as a stoic, private, and humorous man.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the southern Syrian city of Sweida to demand self-determination for the Druze minority. The protest follows deadly sectarian clashes in July between Druze militias and armed Bedouin Sunni tribes, in which Syrian government forces intervened. Druze groups accuse the government of siding with the Bedouin tribes and committing atrocities, resulting in approximately 1,600 deaths. This marks the first time protesters have explicitly used the slogan of self-determination, signaling a significant shift in the political demands of Syria's Druze community amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addressed the plight of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and forcibly transferred to Russia during the war. This issue is a major point of contention, with the International Criminal Court having indicted Putin for his alleged role in these abductions, which Ukraine considers a war crime. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later expressed his gratitude to the First Lady for her attention to this critical humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing stricter scrutiny for legal immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship by expanding the definition of "good moral character." A new policy from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) instructs officers to conduct a more holistic assessment beyond a simple criminal background check. This includes considering positive contributions like community involvement and stable employment, but also scrutinizing minor infractions like reckless driving. Critics argue the move is designed to create more grounds for denial and intimidate eligible immigrants from applying for naturalization.</p>

The couple reportedly views Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home" and will continue to prioritize a private family life without live-in staff. The move, which will be funded privately, allows them to remain in Windsor, where their children are settled in school.</p>

          <p>An architecture startup in Phoenix is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" shelters, designed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual rooms and shared courtyard spaces. Topped with solar panels and equipped with air conditioning, these units can be constructed in just one week, offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution. The project aims to address the affordable housing crisis by creatively using existing materials to provide safe, private living spaces.</p>
