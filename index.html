          <p>The Senegalese women's basketball team had their US training camp cancelled after several players were denied US visas, raising questions about potential travel restrictions. Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko instructed the Ministry of Sports to cancel the ten-day preparatory training initially planned in the United States of America, opting for training in Dakar. Reports indicate that five players and 13 officials were meant to join other team members and their coach already in the US for preparations for the 2025 Women's AfroBasket tournament. The US State Department declined to comment on individual visa cases, citing confidentiality, while Nigeria's Foreign Minister warned that expanded travel bans could hinder energy and mineral deals with West African countries. The optimism score for this article is relatively low due to the disruption of the team's training schedule and the broader implications of travel restrictions. </p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he believes tariffs will not significantly boost inflation. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that moving slowly to ease rates is appropriate given the absence of a major economic threat from inflation. He emphasized the importance of acting to avoid potential labor market slowdowns, noting that waiting for a crash before cutting rates is undesirable. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures, although it remains uncertain whether his position will garner sufficient support within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

          <p>A new study in Jama Pediatrics indicates that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children, while states with more permissive gun laws have seen an increase. The study categorized states based on the strength of their gun control laws and analyzed pediatric firearm death rates over a 12-year period. States with stricter laws, such as California and New York, saw decreased rates of pediatric firearm mortality, while more permissive states experienced substantial increases, especially among children of color. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to translate these findings into action, prioritizing measures like universal background checks and safe-storage regulations.</p>

          <p>A heated debate has been ongoing for half a year regarding whether the return of US President Donald Trump would push Europe and China closer together. For months, EU leaders fuelled the speculation by voicing openness to deeper trade ties with Beijing, in a dramatic rhetorical shift from the previous three years of hostilities. But the debate appears to have been settled this week with a resounding “no”. Behind-the-scenes impatience with China’s failure to put any meat on the bones of a much-vaunted charm offensive has spilled into the public realm. Brussels, staggered by Beijing’s failure to move even an inch on its trade gripes, has had enough.</p>

          <p>Invasive insects like the Asian tiger mosquito and the Asian hornet are becoming increasingly common across Europe due to climate change and global trade, posing significant threats to human health, agriculture, and the environment. These pests compete with native species, destabilize ecosystems, spread diseases, and destroy crops, costing the EU an estimated €12 billion per year. Efforts to manage these insects include traps, nest removal, and treating wooden packing to prevent their spread, but experts stress that a comprehensive approach is needed to mitigate the damage.</p>

          <p>Chris Brown pleaded not guilty in London to a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent related to an alleged 2023 incident in a London nightclub. Brown was arrested in Manchester, England, last month but was released after paying a security fee and has been appearing in concerts as part of his tour. Brown has had multiple run-ins with law enforcement over the years, including a guilty plea to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, in 2009.</p>

          <p>Authorities in southern Mexico are assessing damage from Hurricane Erick, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, resulting in at least two deaths and widespread disruption. Landslides and flooding remain concerns, with officials monitoring rising rivers. The storm, which had strengthened to a Category 4 before weakening, caused power outages for over 120,000 customers and prompted coastal residents, particularly in Acapulco, to take precautions. While restaurants and shops have gradually reopened, schools remain closed as authorities continue to evaluate the extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that low-income children and families would be significantly affected by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While the bill aims to extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, it would reduce key social safety net programs, including Medicaid, CHIP, and SNAP, impacting healthcare, food benefits, and financial assistance for millions of children. The bill proposes changes such as work requirements for Medicaid and expansions to SNAP's existing work requirements, which experts argue could lead to reduced access to essential resources for vulnerable families. In contrast, the CBO projects that the wealthiest households would see an average annual gain of $12,000.</p>
