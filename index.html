          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on inflation, suggesting that recent progress in lowering inflation could be reversed as tariffs take effect. Cook also noted that President Trump's trade policies might negatively affect the labor market, though she acknowledged the economy's current stability. While refraining from commenting on the administration's policies directly, Cook emphasized studying the economic implications, which she believes increase the likelihood of higher inflation and a cooling labor market. She did not specify when the Fed might ease monetary policy, but emphasized the importance of remaining adaptable to economic threats. Optimism is tempered by the uncertainty surrounding trade policy and its potential effects on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national and former University of Michigan student, fled the United States after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election.

Despite a judge's order to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. U.S. Attorney Jerome F.

          <p>Saudi authorities are implementing advanced technologies, including drones, AI, and facial recognition, to enhance safety and manage crowds during this year's Hajj pilgrimage. The Nusuk website and mobile app will register attendees, while smart wristbands will track pilgrims' health and location. While these measures aim to prevent overcrowding and tragic accidents, concerns are rising about data privacy, state surveillance, and potential cybercrime. Critics argue that mandatory technology, coupled with Saudi Arabia's data protection laws, raises questions about the safety and privacy of pilgrims' personal information. The increasing reliance on technology also raises concerns about whether the spiritual essence of the Hajj is being overshadowed by a "cyber experience."</p>

          <p>President Trump is publicly criticizing Republican Senator Rand Paul for opposing the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" due to concerns about the debt ceiling increase. Trump has taken to social media to express his disapproval, asserting that Paul lacks understanding of the bill and its potential for economic growth. Paul, in response, maintains that he has consistently opposed deficit spending under both Republican and Democratic presidents. The legislation in question extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on military and border security, while also cutting Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs, adding trillions to the national debt.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering moving Greenland from the jurisdiction of U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command. This move is seen as a symbolic gesture, suggesting that the U.S. views Greenland as more integral to its own defense rather than Europe's. Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have reportedly encouraged Greenland to separate from Denmark and align with the U.S. for security purposes. President Trump has also expressed interest in acquiring Greenland due to its strategic location and rare earth minerals. However, most Greenlanders reportedly do not support joining the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional idea of a midlife crisis, involving drastic changes like buying a sports car or leaving family, doesn't resonate with many millennials entering their 40s. Millennials, often facing financial instability and valuing mental health, are experiencing midlife as a progress report rather than a sudden implosion. For many, it's about seeking opportunities for personal growth, such as fitness journeys or career changes, rather than abandoning their existing lives. This generation is redefining midlife, focusing on self-discovery and adapting to the unique challenges they face, including economic uncertainties and societal shifts. The emphasis is on acknowledging where they are in life and proactively planning for the future.</p>

          <p>In this "Dear James" advice column, a middle-aged reader laments not feeling "punk rock" despite harboring nihilistic views about the world. James Parker responds by asserting that the reader's cynicism is, in fact, a form of punk rock and encourages them to use their "world-withering vision" as a stimulant rather than a philosophical dead end. He advises the reader to channel their disgust into refining their language and engaging with the world in a meaningful way. Parker recommends the band Godflesh as a fitting musical accompaniment to this worldview.</p>

The think tank cautioned that the UK faces particular challenges due to its "very thin" buffer in public finances. The OECD urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to strengthen public finances through increased tax revenue and spending cuts. While acknowledging better-than-expected UK economic growth between January and March, the OECD warned that "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment.

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has filed a lawsuit against interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, accusing her of malicious prosecution related to his arrest outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility last month. The suit alleges that Habba and Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin sought to politicize Baraka's arrest by promoting a false narrative. Baraka claims he was invited onto the property by an agent of the GEO Group and was only arrested after exiting the gates when instructed. Habba's office moved to dismiss the case against Baraka, with the federal judge assigned to the case criticizing the charges as rushed and politically motivated.</p>

          <p>An American retiree living in Lisbon, Portugal, dispels three common myths about retiring abroad. The first myth is that life will be less stressful, but the author points out that efficiency and customer service may not be as readily available as in the U.S. The second myth is that one will save a lot more money, but Americans often face extra administrative costs and currency exchange rate fluctuations. The third myth is that it will be easy to make friends, but one may struggle to connect in rural areas and it is important to build a support network. Despite these challenges, the author emphasizes the joy of living near the ocean on sunny days.</p>

The rule change came as misinformation about immigrants and social security benefits was being spread.</p>
