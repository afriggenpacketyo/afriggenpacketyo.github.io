          <p>EHang Holdings, a Chinese drone maker, projects that flying taxis could be used for public transport in China within five years and fixed-route air shuttle services by 2030. Conor Yang, EHang's CFO, said the company is conducting trial flights in Guangzhou and Hefei to gather data before launching services in designated areas later this year. EHang has already received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to operate autonomous passenger drones. The company's EH216-S aircraft is available for 2.39 million yuan (US$331,000) on Taobao, and there is strong overseas interest, particularly in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.</p>

          <p>Following a tornado in St. Louis that killed five people, Mayor Cara Spencer placed the city‚Äôs emergency manager, Sarah Russell, on administrative leave pending an investigation. The city's tornado sirens were not activated, and a backup system operated by the Fire Department was broken. Russell was reportedly at a training session during the storm, despite warnings of severe weather. The mayor's office has changed the siren activation protocol, giving the Fire Department sole responsibility to activate the sirens from a constantly staffed office.

          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's crypto and AI advisor, anticipates that the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will pass with bipartisan support. He believes that providing a clear legal framework for stablecoins could unlock trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks noted that there is already over $200 billion in stablecoins that are currently unregulated. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins, has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, indicating strong potential for its passage.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are facing internal divisions over President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, an economic proposal that is pitting the party's hard-line right wing against more moderate members. Conservatives like Representative Tim Burchett are concerned that the bill adds trillions to the national debt and does not cut enough spending. Swing-district Republicans worry that proposed cuts to Medicaid and clean-energy tax credits will hurt their constituents. Despite Trump's efforts to rally the party, disagreements persist, with some holdouts saying they are still opposed to the legislation.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has welcomed Afrikaners as refugees, citing violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners dispute the claim of a 'White genocide' in South Africa. Commentator Piet Croucamp argues that Whites remain economically strong, holding a majority of boardroom positions and earning higher incomes than Black South Africans. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein echoed this sentiment, stating that a White genocide is not happening and that he feels safe on his farm. They suggest that the claims are circulated by right-wing groups and do not reflect the reality for most Afrikaners.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, coinciding with the five-year anniversary of George Floyd‚Äôs killing. Officials and residents expressed dismay, citing the agreement's aim to end violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices. The agreement included policies for training, monitoring, and accountability, but the Justice Department argued such agreements are ineffectual. Mayor Jacob Frey stated Minneapolis remains committed to the changes, despite the administration's withdrawal. This New York Times article highlights the reactions and implications of this decision.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department ended efforts to push for reform in Minneapolis, Louisville, and several other cities. This article explores whether federal involvement makes a difference in policing. Twenty years ago, the New Orleans Police Department's reputation was in tatters, but today, the department‚Äôs stature has vastly improved, even in the eyes of some of its most stringent critics. Critics say the agreements are written with little regard for their practical effects, and that they go beyond correcting unconstitutional behavior to impose a progressive vision of policing.</p>

A Nike spokesperson said the company is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers. Amazon said it will soon begin sourcing a much wider range of Nike products directly to expand its selection for U.S. customers.</p>

The Labour government defends the deal as the best way to guarantee the base's future and ensure UK national security. The move has faced criticism from Reform UK and some Conservatives, but the government will update MPs on the terms, including a potential 40-year extension to the base lease.</p>
