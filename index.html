        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the UK Home Office indicates a record number of Americans applied for British citizenship or indefinite residency in the year leading up to March, with a surge following Donald Trump's second presidential win. Immigration lawyers report increased inquiries, attributing the trend to the polarized political climate in the US. While overall UK net migration has decreased, the rise in US applications is largely driven by spousal or family links, though some politicians suggest expedited qualifications for certain applicants. The UK government is also considering higher language requirements for immigrants, aligning with aspects of Trump's immigration policies. </p>

          <p>President Trump is addressing West Point's graduating class, marking his first military commencement address of his second term. This event follows the implementation of an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, leading to the disbanding of cadet clubs focused on race and gender. Critics, like former West Point professor Graham Parsons, argue these measures undermine education. The address comes after Vice President Vance emphasized a shift in foreign policy away from "forever wars". </p>

          <p>The US clean energy boom faces a potential bust if a proposed tax bill becomes law, terminating key tax credits that have fueled the sector's growth since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The bill would end investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, potentially reducing clean energy deployment by 57% to 72% over the next decade. It also restricts tax credits for projects sourcing materials from prohibited foreign entities, primarily China. While some Republican senators are pushing back, the bill's passage could result in significant job losses and increased electricity costs for consumers. </p>
