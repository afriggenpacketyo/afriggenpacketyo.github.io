          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing extradition to the United States after evading authorities for 21 years. He was recently apprehended in a remote cottage in north Wales, having been the prime suspect in 2003 bombings linked to animal rights extremist groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. Former FBI agents revealed "missed opportunities" to arrest him before his disappearance, including finding a suspected bomb-making factory in his abandoned car. His five-day extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London will determine if the UK hands him over to the US to face charges for maliciously damaging and destroying property with explosives.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are preparing for a week of potential volatility, particularly in bond markets, as the European Central Bank (ECB) is scheduled to meet. Analysts anticipate the ECB will maintain current interest rates, with President Christine Lagarde expected to avoid direct comments on the political uncertainty in France, which has seen rivals threaten to vote against the government. This situation could lead President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap election, further impacting investor confidence in French government bonds ahead of a key Fitch rating review. The article also touches on high-profile CEO departures, reflecting broader corporate and market anxieties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is rapidly enhancing its long-range strike capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aiming to provide an affordable alternative to expensive cruise missiles. This initiative involves collaboration with Washington on drone technology, with the Chien Feng IV suicide drone, a derivative of the MQM-178 system, reportedly having a range of over 1,000km. These drones are positioned to strike deep inside mainland China, including major cities. The system is expected to be unveiled at the upcoming Taipei Aerospace & Defence Technology Exhibition, marking a significant step in Taiwan's defense strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers in much of the UK can anticipate a total lunar eclipse this evening, which will transform the full Moon into a striking red "Blood Moon" as it passes through Earth's shadow. The full eclipse occurs between 18:30 and 19:52, with visibility in the UK depending on moonrise times in different regions. Dr. Edward Bloomer of the Royal Observatory Greenwich explains this phenomenon as Rayleigh scattering, the same effect responsible for red sunsets, where Earth's atmosphere refracts light onto the lunar surface. The article provides guidance on optimal viewing and notes that the next UK-visible lunar eclipse is expected in August 2026.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that world leaders who attempt to ingratiate themselves with Donald Trump often face negative outcomes, citing examples like Narendra Modi, Emmanuel Macron, and Ursula von der Leyen. The author criticizes UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for his "Trump-whisperer act" ahead of an upcoming state visit, suggesting it yields little benefit at a high reputational cost. The piece contends that Trump respects strength and resistance, not groveling, and that Starmer's approach risks portraying the UK as a "lackey state." It calls for Starmer to adopt a more resolute stance, drawing parallels with leaders who have successfully challenged Trump.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, generate a strong force. Scientists can control light flow to direct these "jumpers" up to 1.5 meters into the air or enable them to swim. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, demonstrates cavitation's efficiency as a launching mechanism, opening new possibilities for micro-robotics and highlighting advancements in material science.</p>
