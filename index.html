          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided the clearest images yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will pass closest to the sun in late October. Scientists have refined its size estimate to no more than 3.5 miles across, noting its spherical shape and dark, asphalt-like reflectivity. While most astronomers view it as a natural object, some, like Harvard's Avi Loeb, suggest its unusual characteristics warrant investigation into whether it could be artificial technology.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has officially terminated its $7 billion "Solar for All" program, which was designed to help 900,000 low-income households access affordable solar energy. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the agency no longer has the statutory authority or funds for the program following the passage of a new spending bill. The move has drawn criticism from grant recipients and state energy offices, who warn of lost work, broken promises to tribal nations, and potential lawsuits. The program's end is seen as a significant setback for renewable energy adoption in disadvantaged communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to New York Attorney General Letitia James regarding her office's civil fraud case against Donald Trump and its corruption case against the National Rifle Association. The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, is reportedly examining whether James's office violated the civil rights of Trump or NRA executives. A spokesperson for James condemned the move as a "weaponization of the justice system" and political retribution. The subpoenas represent a significant escalation in the political and legal battles surrounding these high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated there will be "no invasion of Mexico" following reports that President Donald Trump secretly authorized U.S. military force against drug cartels. The directive reportedly provides a basis for operations against cartels, which the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico supports collaboration and coordination in fighting crime, it will never tolerate interventionism or a violation of its sovereignty. The development highlights rising tensions over U.S. counter-narcotics strategy in the region.</p>

Despite beating second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, investors reacted negatively to the leadership change. Analysts also cited growing concerns about increased competition from Amazon's expanding advertising platform and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on overall ad spending. The significant stock drop reflects deep market anxiety about the company's future stability and competitive standing in the ad-tech industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, mistakenly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities, it was confirmed the boat's crew was attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious." Following the mix-up, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity, while maintaining his strong stance on illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>On the 100th anniversary of its publication, Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" is being celebrated as a masterpiece of the midlife crisis. The article reflects on how the book, which unfolds over a single day, offers different insights when read at various stages of life. Initially perceived as a commentary on post-WWI society, its themes of mortality, regret, and finding joy in ordinary life resonate more deeply with age. The author notes that Woolf herself wrote the novel during a fruitful period in her 40s, capturing the complex emotional landscape of middle age with profound realism.</p>

          <p>Footwear company Crocs announced it will reduce orders for the second half of the year due to a "concerning" consumer environment and cautious spending on discretionary items. The company's stock dropped nearly 30% following the news and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the current quarter. CEO Andrew Rees noted that retail partners are also acting more carefully, and the company will take steps to protect profitability, including pulling back on promotions. The warning highlights the broad pressure on retailers as consumers grapple with price increases and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A four-year-old boy, Zaahir Jan, has died after being hit by a bus just outside the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent.

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a district judge's criminal contempt order related to the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The lower court judge, James Boasberg, had found probable cause that officials violated his order to halt the deportations to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. However, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to vacate the contempt finding, representing a significant victory for the administration. The case highlights the ongoing, intense legal and jurisdictional clashes between the executive and judicial branches over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to U.S. courts against blocking his tariff policies, claiming such a move would cause a severe economic downturn comparable to the 1929 stock market crash. In a social media post, he argued that the tariffs have had a "huge positive impact" on the economy and stock market. The comments come as a federal appeals court considers legal challenges to the tariffs, which argue the president may have exceeded the emergency powers granted by Congress. Trump's statement aims to pressure the judiciary by linking his tariff authority to national economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's historical four-year price cycle, which is centered around the "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down, according to market analysts. This predictable pattern typically saw bitcoin rally to a new all-time high 12-18 months after each halving. However, the recent U.S. approval of spot bitcoin ETFs drove the price to a new record *before* the last halving, disrupting the trend. A changing investor profile, increased institutional adoption, and a more supportive regulatory environment are seen as key factors replacing the old cycle with behavior that is more sensitive to macroeconomic liquidity.

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over the investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused vulnerable children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows calls for an independent probe after the BBC reported that five women, who were exploited by grooming gangs as children, also accused officers of sexual assault. South Yorkshire Police requested the handover to ensure transparency and a victim-centered approach. The inquiry will now be managed by Operation Stovewood, the NCA's long-running investigation into child sexual abuse in the area.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with debt who find consolidation loans unaffordable, several alternative strategies exist. This article suggests options such as negotiating directly with creditors for lower interest rates or extended repayment terms. Other alternatives include debt settlement, where a lump-sum payment is negotiated for less than the total amount owed, or using a 0% APR balance transfer credit card to pause interest accumulation. For those needing more structured help, working with a non-profit credit counseling agency to create a debt management plan can provide a manageable path toward financial freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant surge in price over the past two years, there are indicators that the price of gold could see a temporary decline. A key factor is cooling inflation; since gold is often used as an inflation hedge, a decrease in the inflation rate could lower its price. Similarly, an easing of geopolitical tensions, which have historically driven investors to the safe-haven asset, could also lead to a price retreat. A combination of these factors would likely lower investor demand, providing a more affordable entry point for those looking to buy gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the launch of the advanced AI model GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will prioritize growth and investment in training and computing power, even if it means operating at a loss for a long time. While OpenAI's revenue is on track to pass $20 billion this year, the company is still not profitable due to the immense costs of developing its models. Altman expressed that as long as the models continue to improve on their current trajectory, it is rational to run a loss. This strategy is supported by strong investor interest, with OpenAI reportedly in talks for a stock sale valuing the company at roughly $500 billion.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will halt exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in its Gaza operations. The decision, a significant policy shift for one of Israel's staunchest allies, came in response to Israel's expansion of military action in Gaza City. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz cited deep concern for the civilian population and the growing difficulty in seeing how Israel's military goals could be achieved under the circumstances. The suspension leaves open the possibility of other military sales, such as missile defense systems, but marks a major diplomatic rebuke from Berlin.</p>

The move follows an attack on a well-known administration figure and a threat from the president to "federalize" the city. The operation involves multiple federal agencies, including ICE and the U.S. Park Police, working alongside local police in high-traffic tourist areas. This action comes despite city data showing that violent crime in D.C. reached a 30-year low in 2024 and has continued to decline in 2025.</p>

While some climate change information has also been altered or removed, the erasure of environmental justice content has been more comprehensive.
