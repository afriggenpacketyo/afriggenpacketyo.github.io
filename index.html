          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 roles as part of a cost-cutting initiative aimed at reviving the luxury brand's performance. The job cuts, expected to impact office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory, are part of a larger plan to save Â£60 million by 2027. This follows previous cost-cutting measures announced in November, bringing the total estimated savings to Â£100 million. Despite sales falling slightly less than anticipated in the fiscal fourth quarter, Burberry remains optimistic about delivering sustainable profitable growth, though analysts suggest the turnaround may take time.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to consider the nationwide freeze on President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, a policy that has been debated for over a century.

Legal scholars and courts have generally held that the amendment extends citizenship beyond the children of former slaves.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Capital One, accusing the bank of "cheating" customers out of millions of dollars in interest payments. The lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as high-yield but failed to inform customers about a new, higher-interest "360 Performance Savings" product. The lawsuit mimics a similar case by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that was dropped earlier this year. Capital One disputes the claims and intends to defend itself in court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the immediate release of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher detained by immigration authorities. The judge found that Suri's detention violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The government cited Suri's alleged "close connections" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking his visa, but the judge refuted claims that Suri supported Hamas. The ACLU called Suri's detention an "unprecedented attack" designed to punish students for their views. Suri's attorneys argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech is unjust.</p>

          <p>The fiscal centerpiece of the "big, beautiful bill" now making its way through Congress is to take Medicaid away from jobless adults. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the work requirement would save $300 billion over a decade and take health insurance from 7.6 million people. The author argues that, although work requirements poll well, the policyâ€™s Republican proponents donâ€™t have much confidence that voters will appreciate the way they function in practice. As a compromise with skittish members of Congress in districts with large numbers of Medicaid recipients, the work requirements wonâ€™t go into effect until 2029, so that the legislators who voted to throw their constituents off their insurance arenâ€™t held accountable in either of the next two election cycles.</p>
