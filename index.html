            <p>Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, dismissed calls for denuclearization as a "daydream" and asserted that North Korea will never abandon its nuclear weapons program. She stated that North Korea's nuclear ambitions are enshrined in its constitution and any discussions of denuclearization are considered a hostile act. Tensions in the region have been rising as Kim Jong Un continues to develop his nuclear capabilities and align with Russia, ignoring calls for denuclearization talks. This statement follows South Korea firing warning shots at North Korean soldiers who crossed the border. Optimism is low given the country's increasing nuclear capabilities and lack of interest in diplomatic solutions.</p>

            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions between China and the United States, some Chinese exporters are reportedly ditching shipments mid-voyage to avoid high tariff costs. The tariffs, imposed by the second Trump administration, have led to a significant drop in US-bound container volume. One company reported halting all shipping plans from the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, scrapping orders that haven't been loaded and re-costing cargo already at sea. One client reportedly abandoned goods already en route, indicating the severity of the tariff impact. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's foreign ministry reiterated that Beijing will take "resolute and forceful" measures to protect its interests after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. A white paper released by the State Council Information Office stated that China would counter and fight the U.S. to the end if it continues to escalate trade restrictions. The Chinese administration believes the tariffs will not help with U.S. trade surplus issues, but will instead prompt volatility in financial markets, exacerbate inflationary pressure and undermine American industries. Beijing remains open to dialogue but insists the U.S. cancel unilateral trade barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, is seeking an emergency stay of her trial from Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Read's lawyers argue that a retrial on murder and fleeing the scene charges constitutes double jeopardy, as jurors in the first trial allegedly unanimously found her not guilty on those charges but could not reach an agreement on manslaughter. They are asking the Supreme Court to rule on whether a "unanimous but unannounced" decision triggers Fifth Amendment protections. Read maintains her innocence, claiming someone else beat O'Keefe and left him in the cold.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's latest tariffs against America's trading partners have taken effect, imposing taxes ranging from 20% to 104% on imported goods. Trump claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy and protect jobs, while economists warn of potential harm to the world economy and rising prices for U.S. consumers. The tariffs are intended to encourage U.S. consumers to buy American-made goods and reduce the trade deficit. However, the measures have caused volatility in global stock markets and raised concerns about a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Asian shares experienced further losses as the latest set of U.S. tariffs took effect, including a substantial 104% levy on Chinese imports. The Nikkei 225 in Japan saw a significant drop, and other Asian markets followed suit. Investors are uncertain about the duration and impact of Trump's tariffs, which are expected to raise prices for U.S. consumers and potentially slow the economy. Some analysts remain hopeful that negotiations could mitigate the worst-case scenario, while China has vowed to "fight to the end."</p>

            <p>China will "strike back and fight to the very end" in response to new US tariffs on Chinese goods, according to state media. Despite the escalating trade war, China remains open to discussions with the US, but not under current conditions. Since February, China has implemented more than 20 countermeasures in response to US duties, emphasizing that these actions are a reaction to US policies, not a matter of China's volition. Washington has raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a cumulative 104% in several phases.</p>
