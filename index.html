          <p>A group of international culinary experts toured Higashikagawa and Miki in Kagawa Prefecture to experience the region's food culture. The chefs visited a soy sauce brewery, participated in a traditional tea ceremony, and made "somen" noodles by hand. Participants praised the emphasis on simple cooking using local ingredients, drawing parallels between Japanese and Italian culinary traditions. The tour was organized in conjunction with a national conference promoting food education, showcasing the rich flavors and cultural experiences of Kagawa. The event also featured a performance of classical Japanese court music, providing a memorable experience for the international guests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany may face tax hikes and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target. The country currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, but a potential increase to 5% would require additional billions of euros annually. Experts suggest that financing these expenses would likely involve loans, budget cuts, and tax increases. While Germany has implemented fiscal measures to accommodate defense expenditures, concerns remain regarding the long-term impact on the federal budget and potential conflicts with EU fiscal rules.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after escalating aerial attacks, although this announcement was met with initial skepticism and denial from Iranian officials. The agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared ended. In the hours leading up to the ceasefire, Israel reported a barrage of missiles from Iran, resulting in casualties. Trump's announcement came after the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear targets in response to intelligence suggesting Iran was close to obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>

Woodward was eventually charged with murder, with a hate crime enhancement added later due to Bernstein's sexual orientation. Woodward was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, while Bernstein's parents started a movement called "BlazeItForward" to inspire acts of kindness in their son's memory.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, touting it as a sign of lasting peace after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. He claimed the U.S. had ensured the "obliteration" of Iran's nuclear program, but questions remain about the completeness of the destruction and a missing stockpile of enriched uranium. While the quick end to fighting could boost Trump's presidency, the situation's durability is uncertain, especially regarding Iran's potential pursuit of nuclear weapons and Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

The market sell-off indicates investor confidence that the situation will de-escalate following U.S. strikes on Iran. Some analysts suggest President Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate the conflict, adopting a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the prevention of any loss of life, and called for peace negotiations.</p>

Extraction methods in Myanmar, however, have high environmental costs, causing China to outsource its rare earth extraction to the country.

McDonnell said the department would evaluate each use-of-force incident and take action against any officer who violated standards. The chief cited cases of officers being violently attacked and maintained that force was targeted and proportional, while critics point to eyewitness accounts and video clips suggesting excessive force was used on non-threatening protesters.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The MPs have signed an amendment to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety, citing concerns about pushing people into poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The government defends the changes as necessary for welfare reform, while Labour MPs argue that the plans will negatively impact vulnerable populations and the job market. The vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a migrant detention center, dubbed the 'Alligator Alcatraz,' on an air strip in the Everglades to temporarily hold migrants. The proposal, aimed at ramping up deportations, has been criticized for its potential environmental impact on the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. The facility, costing approximately $450 million a year to run, is intended to serve as a natural deterrent for escapees due to its location in the alligator and python-inhabited Everglades. Critics argue the project could be environmentally devastating, while supporters claim it will enhance security and deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, which he claims could lead to lasting peace. The ceasefire follows U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a retaliatory missile strike by Iran on a U.S. base in Qatar. While the situation remains volatile, Trump's intervention could be seen as a successful step back from a wider regional conflict. Iranian officials indicated a willingness to halt attacks if Israel ceased its aggression, suggesting a potential de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in New York are concluding their case in the sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who is accused of using his power to facilitate sexual abuse and conceal his crimes. The prosecution relied on testimonies from former girlfriends and employees detailing instances of abuse and coercion. However, jurors were also shown loving text messages sent by the women to Mr. Combs, potentially complicating the prosecution's narrative. The prosecution also seeks to prove that Mr. Combs ran a criminal enterprise using loyal employees to facilitate his abuse, which is a charge that is more difficult to prove because of the many technical parts of the racketeering statute.</p>
