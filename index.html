          <p>New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Mikie Sherrill participated in a "No Kings" protest, where she committed to fighting former President Donald Trump's policies. Speaking to the crowd in Montclair, Sherrill criticized Trump's agenda, accusing him of raising costs for residents and operating what she termed a "worldwide extortion racket." The event also featured other prominent Democrats, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who voiced support for Sherrill and criticized her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli. Recent polling indicates a tightening race, with Sherrill holding a narrow lead over Ciattarelli just weeks before the election.</p>

Red Bull's Max Verstappen went on to win the event, narrowing his points deficit in the championship standings. The crash intensifies the focus on the competitive relationship between the two McLaren teammates as their team tries to manage the rivalry during a tense title battle.</p>

          <p>Activists organized a second wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States to demonstrate against what they describe as abuses of power by former President Donald Trump. Organizers, including a coalition of groups like the ACLU and Indivisible, anticipated millions of participants at over 2,600 planned events nationwide. The protests focus on issues such as Trump's immigration policies and the deployment of troops to American cities. In response, prominent Republicans have labeled the events "Hate America" rallies, while some Republican governors placed the National Guard on standby, citing concerns over potential unrest.</p>

          <p>Vermont State Senator Samuel Douglass has resigned from his position after his involvement in a racist and antisemitic group chat among Young Republicans was exposed. In the leaked messages, Douglass made derogatory comments about an Indigenous woman and participated in an exchange containing an antisemitic remark from his wife. The scandal has prompted widespread condemnation, including from Vermont's governor, who called for Douglass to leave the Republican party. In his resignation statement, Douglass apologized for the offense caused and cited horrific threats of violence against his family as a reason for stepping down to ensure their safety.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, a prominent Southern California labor union leader, will see a felony charge against him reduced to a misdemeanor. Huerta was arrested during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles, where he was accused of obstructing federal officers. His arrest sparked outrage among immigrant advocates and Democratic leaders, who called it a politically motivated act of retaliation by the Trump administration. Huerta's attorneys stated they will seek a speedy trial to vindicate him, asserting that the charges were an attempt to silence dissent and punish political opposition.</p>

          <p>A 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between San Clemente and Oceanside was temporarily shut down for a military event involving live artillery fire over the freeway. The closure, directed by the White House, affects the portion of the highway running alongside Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, a critical transportation corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego. This shutdown forces motorists onto a significant detour via Interstate 15, potentially turning a 23-minute drive into a journey of over two hours. Rail services, including Amtrak and Metrolink, were also disrupted by the unprecedented military exercise over a major civilian highway.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, experts project that rebuilding the Gaza Strip will be a monumental task, potentially costing $70 billion and spanning several decades. The two-year conflict resulted in immense devastation, with a United Nations assessment indicating that 83% of buildings in Gaza City were damaged. Key infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and water systems, has been destroyed, creating a severe humanitarian crisis. While European and Arab nations have shown willingness to fund the reconstruction, they have signaled that financial commitments are contingent on tangible progress toward a long-term political solution and Palestinian statehood.</p>

Titled "Nobody's Girl," the book details her experience of being recruited into Epstein's circle at age 16. Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had also sought the release of the Epstein Files, which are currently controlled by the Trump administration. The memoir is expected to shed more light on her life as a survivor and her fight for justice, potentially renewing focus on Maxwell, who is imprisoned for sex trafficking.</p>

An enigmatic figure, he was celebrated for his genre-defining albums like "Brown Sugar" and "Voodoo," which blended R&B, funk, and soul, earning him comparisons to legends like Prince and Marvin Gaye. After the massive success of his 2000 music video for "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" led to intense objectification, he retreated from the public eye for over a decade. He returned in 2014 with "Black Messiah," a politically charged album that resonated with the burgeoning social justice movement.</p>

He spends thousands of his own money annually on the project, hosting events where kids can choose a costume for free.

          <p>A new study from Macromedia University in Hamburg reveals a significant distortion in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned approximately three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. The research, led by journalism professor Thomas Hestermann, indicates this disparity has sharply increased since 2015, influencing public perception of crime and migration. Criminologist Gina Wollinger argues this "migrantization" of crime is not based on origin but on risk factors like poverty and lack of prospects. The study suggests that increasing diversity within newsrooms could help correct this discriminatory reporting pattern.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a recent study by DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more likely to rush relationship milestones like moving in together or marriage. The survey of 2,000 U.S. singles found that financial savings was a primary motivator for men. However, experts suggest a deeper reason is that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their main source of social and emotional support. This dependency can lead to lower psychological well-being when they are single, as they tend to have fewer close, intimate friendships compared to women.</p>

This approach can provide a reliable form of downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes. As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates, having an income source independent of central bank policy is becoming increasingly important for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

With suicide rates rising among Black men, who are less likely to seek professional help, such community-led initiatives provide a crucial gateway to healing and emotional expression.

          <p>A student trip to China, once a routine part of international studies, has become a politically charged act for students from Texas. Following a state order restricting the use of state funds for travel to China, students like Krislyn Massey from the University of North Texas had to organize their trip through a non-profit instead of their school. The measure reflects the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, which are now affecting academic and cultural exchanges. This new political climate forces students and educators to navigate a complex landscape to pursue cross-cultural connections that were previously encouraged.</p>

Greene emphasizes that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and recommends submitting 100 to 200 applications to increase the odds of success.

Selected through an online vote organized by the publisher PONS Langenscheidt, the phrase beat out other contenders like "goonen" and "checkst du."

Key strategies include teaching children about online privacy and the value of their time.

While the passports themselves remain valid due to a court order, the new rule creates uncertainty about international travel and is seen by advocates as a way to make travel more difficult for gender-nonconforming individuals.</p>
