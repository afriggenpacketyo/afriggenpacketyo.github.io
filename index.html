          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for employers filing new H-1B visa petitions for highly skilled foreign workers, a significant increase from previous costs. The White House clarified that this is a one-time payment for new applicants only and does not apply to current visa holders or renewals. The policy, aimed at encouraging companies to hire American workers, affects industries like tech and finance that rely heavily on the program to fill specialized roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to classify the anti-fascist movement Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization has sparked a debate over its legality and constitutional implications. Critics argue the move is a politically motivated crackdown on dissent that could infringe on First Amendment rights, as there is no existing legal framework for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. Experts note that Antifa is a decentralized movement, not a formal organization, making such a designation a radical and legally questionable path that risks targeting peaceful activists.</p>

This move brings together the "America First" wing of the party, represented by Ramaswamy, and the more established faction associated with Husted, who was appointed by Governor Mike DeWine. The joint endorsements are seen as a strategic effort to present a strong, united Republican front ahead of the upcoming elections in the deep-red state.</p>

          <p>The administration's claim linking Tylenol to autism is being framed by critics as the latest step in a broader movement that questions proven medical interventions and promotes "natural" motherhood. This campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has also undermined access to COVID vaccines and antidepressants for pregnant women, despite expert consensus on their benefits outweighing risks. This approach aligns with an "appeal to nature" fallacy that could ultimately endanger women's health by creating fear around safe and necessary medical treatments.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is proposing that the UK offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research has been affected by funding cuts under the Trump administration. In a speech, Davey will argue that Britain should step in to support biomedical research if the U.S. government pursues an "anti-science agenda." The proposal follows the U.S. government's decision to cut billions from research grants, a move that prompted concern among scientists and medical organizations about the future of life-saving breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that the FDA will issue a notice to physicians about an unproven link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that HHS will launch a public campaign about the alleged risk, a move that contradicts the bulk of scientific literature and advice from major medical groups. In response, Tylenol's manufacturer Kenvue strongly disagreed, citing the drug's safety record and the health risks of leaving fever and pain untreated during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>A series of high-profile incidents has intensified the debate surrounding freedom of speech in the UK, with some critics, like Nigel Farage, making comparisons to authoritarian regimes. The controversy is fueled by arrests over social media posts and differing content moderation policies by tech giants, creating a lack of consensus on what constitutes prosecutable hate speech versus protected offensive speech. While the UK's Human Rights Act offers a "qualified right" to free speech, recent events have highlighted the growing tension between ensuring public safety and protecting expression in an increasingly polarized society.</p>

          <p>A new NHS initiative named "Jess's Rule" is urging general practitioners in England to "think again" if a patient's condition does not improve after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, who died from cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed over five months. The guidance encourages doctors to consider further tests, second opinions, or specialist referrals in such cases, aiming to improve patient safety and catch serious illnesses like cancer earlier, particularly in younger patients.</p>

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030, the strategic document is seen as crucial for navigating global uncertainty and achieving ambitious long-term goals. The plan is expected to lay the groundwork for reaching the status of a "moderately" developed country by 2035, a key milestone toward becoming a "modern socialist country" by 2049. Experts suggest that amid rising domestic and international challenges, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past to ensure sustainable development.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern California successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning online posts by a former student of Menlo-Atherton High School, leading to a campus lockdown until the student was located and weapons were recovered. The Sandy Hook Promise organization, which created the tip line, stated this is the 19th credible planned attack the system has helped avert since its launch, highlighting the critical role of community reporting in school safety.</p>

He was ultimately selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round, a move his father supports, stating that players are expected to be ready to play immediately in the NFL, not to "learn sitting on the bench."</p>
