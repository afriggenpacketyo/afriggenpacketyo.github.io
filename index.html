          <p>In 1950, the U.S. government deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist who had contributed significantly to American aerospace and weaponry, due to McCarthy-era xenophobia. Qian returned to China and played a pivotal role in developing China's missile and space programs, transforming the nation into a superpower. This deportation serves as a cautionary tale as the U.S. considers aggressively revoking visas of Chinese students in critical fields, potentially hindering American scientific advancement and bolstering China's technological prowess. The article emphasizes that shunning foreign talent can have significant and lasting consequences on the global balance of power.

          <p>A Chinese economist cautions that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in China-US rivalry, although the chance of full-scale sanctions remains slim. Washington might adopt a strategy of targeting specific Chinese entities and gradually expanding the scope to push China out of the US dollar system. The economist notes that implementing full-blown financial sanctions would be difficult due to China's significant role in global trade and investment. Excluding China from the Swift system could undermine Swift's importance as countries shift to China's alternative payment system.
