          <p>Linda Hogan, Hulk Hogan's ex-wife, has publicly addressed the wrestling icon's recent death for the first time, expressing profound devastation and shock. Despite their contentious 2009 divorce after 29 years of marriage, she revealed lingering love and the deep impact of his passing, stating she "never got over him" and had been "weeping all day." Hulk Hogan, who died from reported cardiac arrest, had endured numerous health issues, including 25 surgeries in the decade prior to his death, a context that adds to the sorrow surrounding his passing for those close to him. The article highlights the emotional toll on his family.</p>

          <h2>Phoenix Firefighters Employ Ice Bags for Rapid Heatstroke Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:08:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phoenix firefighters are adopting a remarkably effective, low-tech solution to combat deadly heatstroke: cold water immersion using bags of ice. This emergency protocol involves placing patients suffering from core temperatures of 104 degrees or higher into a bag filled with ice water, rapidly cooling them on the way to the hospital. The method, originally military-developed, cools patients three to five times faster than traditional techniques, significantly preventing brain damage and organ failure. This innovative approach has already led to a decrease in heat-related deaths in Phoenix, setting a national example as heatwaves intensify due to climate change.</p>

          <h2>EPA Moves to Revoke Landmark Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:07:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," which legally established greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and the basis for regulating emissions under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin calls this the "largest deregulatory action in American history," claiming it will save Americans billions annually by repealing related vehicle regulations and boosting consumer choice. However, critics, including scientists and former EPA officials, condemn the move as "criminal negligence" and a dangerous reversal, especially as climate change impacts intensify and the EPA's own regulatory report previously projected trillions in net benefits from limiting emissions. The legality of this action is expected to be challenged in court.</p>

          <p>An American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited widespread online controversy, with some critics alleging it promotes "eugenics" due to its ad copy about "genes" and Sweeney's fair-skinned image. The article delves into how Sweeney's public persona, perceived by some as aligned with conservative ideals, fuels this backlash, despite her past support for Black Lives Matter. This incident exemplifies how the internet's information ecosystem distorts political and cultural discourse, stripping original context and amplifying minor posts into major spectacles. The controversy highlights the cynical exploitation of cultural moments for content creation and ideological battles, often reducing genuine concerns to superficial arguments, leaving many feeling frustrated.</p>

          <p>Four victims killed in a Midtown Manhattan office building shooting have been identified, including an off-duty NYPD officer, two security guards, a Blackstone executive, and a Cornell graduate. The gunman, Shane Tamura, allegedly targeted NFL offices in the building, blaming his traumatic head injury on the league in a recovered note. Mayor Eric Adams stated that Tamura took the wrong elevator, leading him to the Rudin Management offices, where he encountered some of the victims. This tragic event has prompted widespread grief and a state-wide order for flags to be flown at half-staff, as investigations into the precise motive and circumstances continue to unfold. An NFL employee was also injured but is in stable condition.</p>

The survey also suggests Trump's pressure for rate cuts might be counterproductive, with most experts forecasting cuts later in the year, likely in September.

These "Accelerated MD" tracks aim to produce competent physicians more rapidly, with analyses showing no significant difference in medical knowledge or performance compared to traditional programs. Beyond expediting entry into practice, these programs offer substantial financial savings for students by reducing a year of tuition and allowing earlier earning.

Despite recent Israeli measures like daily humanitarian pauses and airdrops, the UN and Palestinians report little change, with aid deliveries still overwhelmed by desperate crowds. The IPC's alert, based on data up to July 25, indicates famine thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have been reached in parts of Gaza, with essential health services having collapsed.

          <p>Los Angeles County supervisors have taken a significant step towards banning federal immigration officers from concealing their identities with masks or gaiters while operating in unincorporated areas. This initiative stems from concerns over agents refusing to identify themselves during widespread immigration raids, which supervisors argue violate constitutional and civil rights, and could lead to impersonation. While the Department of Homeland Security claims agents need anonymity for protection from doxing, legal experts suggest a county ban on federal agents would likely face constitutional challenges under the supremacy clause, as federal law generally takes precedence. Despite anticipated litigation, county officials are prepared to challenge federal authority in court, aiming to protect residents.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal poll indicates a significant shift in American public opinion, with over half now opposing recent tax cuts, challenging the long-held political orthodoxy that tax reductions are inherently popular. This sentiment mirrors the unpopularity of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which many Americans incorrectly believed wouldn't benefit them and were seen as disproportionately aiding the wealthy. The article attributes this change to factors like already lower overall tax burdens for the wealthy, rising income inequality, and the failure of tax cuts to "pay for themselves" as proponents claimed. This shift complicates future fiscal policy debates, as politicians face public aversion to both tax cuts and increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Orleans has launched the "Crescent City ID" municipal identification program, aiming to provide ID cards to vulnerable residents, including migrants and homeless individuals, who may lack traditional identification. This initiative, championed by the mayor's office and immigrant rights organizations, seeks to enhance access to city services and foster a sense of belonging. The program's launch comes amid a nationwide crackdown by the Trump administration on "sanctuary" cities, raising questions about potential federal response, as the Justice Department has sued other cities for similar policies. New Orleans officials plan to store minimal information to protect applicants, acknowledging fears of federal subpoenas from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>EPA Director Lee Zeldin has asserted that his agency lacks the inherent authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that the foundational 2009 "endangerment finding" was based on flawed reasoning. Zeldin also cited the Supreme Court's 2024 "Chevron deference" ruling, claiming it shifts regulatory power to Congress, not the EPA, for vehicle and energy emissions. He presented this proposal as the "largest deregulatory action" in U.S. history, intended to remove economic drag from environmental regulations, though no evidence was provided to back the claimed $54 billion annual savings. This article highlights the administration's "ideological" stance against environmental oversight and the certainty of immediate legal challenges to this controversial move.</p>

          <p>Germany is preparing multi-billion-euro procurement orders for military equipment, including 20 Eurofighter jets and thousands of Boxer and Patria armored vehicles, as part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to build Europe's most powerful conventional army. This strategic shift aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. and bolster European security, with Germany exempting defense spending from constitutional debt limits to finance the overhaul. The significant increase in the regular defense budget to 83 billion euro by 2026 reflects a commitment to meet NATO's 3.5% GDP defense spending benchmark by 2029, addressing past neglect of military readiness and enhancing national defense capabilities.

          <p>In the aftermath of the Manhattan office shooting, where the gunman Shane Tamura suspected he had CTE, this article explores the "dangerous logic" of CTE self-diagnosis. Experts emphasize that CTE can only be confirmed posthumously and its symptoms overlap with many other disorders, making self-diagnosis unreliable and potentially harmful by fostering a sense of hopelessness. While research validates CTE's link to professional football, its prevalence in high school players is less studied and likely rare. The article cautions against attributing mental illness or violence solely to suspected CTE, especially when other factors like documented mental health history may be present.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is hydrating and nutritious, consuming it in excess can lead to unexpected side effects, primarily digestive problems. The article explains that watermelon is a "high FODMAP" food, containing certain sugars that can cause intestinal stress for some individuals, particularly those with irritable bowel syndrome. Additionally, its high tyramine content may trigger migraine headaches in prone individuals and can dangerously interact with certain depression medications. In rare cases, it may also cause severe allergic reactions for people with grass or ragweed allergies. Although generally healthy, moderation is advised, especially for diabetics due to its natural sugar content, and consuming it with protein and fat can mitigate blood sugar impact.</p>

While Nevada maintains an open-carry policy, it has implemented stricter measures since a 2017 mass shooting, including universal background checks for all private firearm purchases and "red flag" laws. These Extreme Risk Protection Orders allow temporary removal of guns from individuals proven to be a danger.

The article suggests that Europe's adherence to liberal principles in a realist international system has been exploited by the U.S., leading to increased military dependence on the transatlantic alliance and significant economic concessions.
