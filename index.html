The discovery revealed that the creature was more complex than previously known radiodonts, with a segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills.

The office in Jackson, serving eastern Kentucky, usually operates with a staff of 14 meteorologists but is down to nine. This situation highlights the challenges faced by the National Weather Service due to recent staffing cuts. </p>

          <p>The audio recording of former President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals struggles to recall dates and details, reinforcing concerns about his age and mental acuity. The recording, released by Axios, contrasts with Democrats' previous assurances of Biden's sharpness and command. Hur's assessment that Biden is a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory" is supported by the audio. The release of the recording puts Democrats in an uncomfortable position, forcing them to reconcile the interview with their earlier descriptions of the former president. </p>
