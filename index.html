          <h2>UK Braces for Weekend Heatwave with Temperatures Expected to Reach 34C</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:11:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures predicted to peak at 34C over the weekend. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for all of England, warning of potential significant impacts on health and social care services. While the heat is widespread, it is unlikely to surpass the year's highest temperature of 35.8C. Climate scientists emphasize that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, which also disrupts wildlife cycles by causing events like butterfly hatching to occur out of sync with bird breeding seasons.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Increased and Unpredictable National Security Threat from Iran, Warns Parliamentary Committee</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:09:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK parliamentary intelligence committee has issued a stark warning that the threat from Iran is "rising" and "unpredictable," urging the government to adopt a more robust, long-term strategy. The report highlights a significant increase in physical threats, including at least 15 assassination or kidnapping plots against UK-based individuals, particularly opponents of the Iranian regime, since early 2022. The committee criticizes the government's current approach as reactive "fire-fighting," focused mainly on Iran's nuclear program at the expense of other dangers like espionage and cyber attacks. The threat level from physical attacks is now considered comparable to that posed by Russia.</p>

          <h2>Australian Police Appeal for Information on Missing 26-Year-Old German Backpacker</h2>

          <p>Authorities in Western Australia are conducting a large-scale search for a 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, who has been missing for over a week. She was last seen on June 29 in the small agricultural town of Beacon. Her van was later discovered unattended with apparent mechanical issues in a remote area about 300 kilometers northeast of Perth. Police have stated there is no evidence of third-party involvement but are treating her disappearance as "unexplained" and "concerning," as she had been in regular contact with her family in Germany. The search may need to cover a vast area as she had planned to travel extensively.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Potential Impact of Ranked-Choice Voting on California's Political Landscape</h2>

          <p>An opinion article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California politics, drawing comparisons to its use in New York City. Proponents argue RCV saves money by eliminating runoffs, encourages less negative campaigning, and can increase representation for women and people of color. In California, which uses a "top-two" nonpartisan primary system, RCV could eliminate primaries altogether in many local races and potentially give underrepresented parties a better chance in state elections. The system's effects are uncertain; it could lead to more centrist outcomes through strategic crossover voting or, conversely, push candidates to extremes to capture second- and third-choice votes from partisan bases.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that South Wales Police are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former bishop, Anthony Pierce, and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. Victims have come forward stating their concerns were ignored for decades, with one allegation against Pierce dating back to 1986, 13 years before he was made a bishop. The investigation highlights a pattern of institutional failure, where Pierce allegedly failed to act on abuse claims made against others after he was promoted. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings and has commissioned reviews into its culture and safeguarding procedures.</p>

The victims were reportedly queuing for nutritional supplements near a medical point when the strike occurred. This attack comes as indirect ceasefire and hostage release negotiations continue in Doha, though a breakthrough appears unlikely in the near term, with both Israel and Hamas signaling that significant disagreements remain. The conflict, which began after the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 57,000 deaths in Gaza and widespread destruction.</p>

McLean attributes his past substance use to low self-esteem and views his recovery as a continuous process of self-work and helping others.

          <p>A new redistricting plan in Tarrant County, Texas, is being criticized as partisan gerrymandering designed to secure Republican victories in the 2026 midterm elections. The approved map shifts people of color into a different precinct, a move critics call racial gerrymandering, while the county judge openly admitted it was a partisan effort to elect another Republican. This local move comes as the Trump administration encourages more redistricting in Texas. Experts suggest this is part of a broader GOP strategy to counteract potential losses in other states and solidify control in Texas, a state that is less conservative than its voting patterns suggest due to low turnout.</p>

          <p>The European Union is advancing its strategy to "de-risk" from China by proposing new measures aimed at regaining control over key economic sectors and reducing dependency on Chinese supply chains. The plans include stockpiling critical materials, implementing tighter trade defenses, and encouraging the reshoring of industries. This reflects a broader geopolitical agenda where the EU views industrial policy and economic resilience as essential tools. The move is a direct response to concerns over China's dominance in certain sectors, with an EU official stating that these dependencies present a "real challenge for Europe to confront" and require a multi-faceted approach to address.</p>

          <p>Current and former ICE employees report that morale within the agency is "in the crapper" due to immense pressure from the Trump administration to meet unrealistic deportation quotas. Officers describe the mission as miserable and impossible, with a shift away from targeting serious criminals towards arresting "low-hanging fruit" like gardeners and asylum seekers to inflate statistics. The White House's focus on deporting one million people annually has led to shelving major criminal investigations into drug trafficking and child exploitation. Despite President Trump's public praise, many staffers feel bullied by an administration that has purged top leaders and created a high-pressure, unsustainable work environment.</p>

This shift marks a significant change from past practices, where the primary option was often over-the-counter painkillers.

He faces challenges, with Republicans criticizing California's high cost of living and social issues, and some Democrats questioning if he is too progressive to win over swing voters.

The author contends that the same anti-science and anti-public education sentiments from the Scopes era are visible today in the religious right's efforts to divert public funds to religious schools, posing an ongoing threat to American democracy.</p>

          <p>In a successful rescue operation, 31 workers were brought to safety after a tunnel they were constructing for a municipal wastewater project collapsed in Los Angeles. The incident occurred in an 18-foot diameter tunnel, with the collapse happening about five to six miles from the only access point. The trapped workers managed to climb over a large pile of soil to meet colleagues on the other side, who then shuttled them out. Over 100 LAFD responders, including specialized Urban Search and Rescue teams, were at the scene. All workers were evaluated by paramedics, but none had visible injuries, leading officials to call the outcome a blessing.</p>

          <p>Germany's federal police are facing a dramatic increase in workload and poor working conditions due to the government's tightened border controls aimed at limiting immigration. The federal police commissioner's annual report highlights that officers have accumulated over 720,000 overtime hours on this task alone, leading to staff shortages in other areas. The report also points to inadequate infrastructure, such as officers being forced to use portable toilets at checkpoints. Furthermore, officers are in a difficult position, caught between a court ruling that deems turning back asylum seekers illegal and direct orders from the interior minister to continue the practice.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel for their roles in the "operational failure" during an assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania last year. A gunman, Matthew Crooks, fired at Trump, grazing his ear and killing an attendee before being shot dead by security. The agency's deputy director, Matt Quinn, confirmed the suspensions ranged from 10 to 42 days without pay and stated the service is accountable for the failure. This action follows intense scrutiny and critical reports from Congress that identified preventable security lapses, including the failure to secure the rooftop from which the gunman fired.</p>

          <p>Years before deadly floods devastated Kerr County, Texas, local officials knew they needed a flood warning system but struggled to fund it after being denied federal grants. Now, acquiring such funding is even more challenging as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions in federal disaster preparedness aid, shifting the responsibility to states. In Texas, state-level grant programs often require local communities to cover the vast majority of project costs, an unfeasible proposition for many. This leaves communities like Kerr County, located in a high-risk flash flood zone, vulnerable and without the resources needed to build life-saving infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a zonal electricity pricing system, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographic location. Instead, it will pursue reforms to the current national pricing system. Proponents of zonal pricing argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland and incentivize industries to locate near power sources. However, some energy firms warned the major overhaul could deter investment. The industry group Energy UK welcomed the decision for providing policy clarity, while critics argue that simply reforming the existing system will not solve the deep-rooted issues in Great Britain's electricity market.</p>

          <p>UK regulator Ofcom has approved Royal Mail's plan to cease Saturday deliveries for second-class letters as part of a cost-cutting reform. The change, effective July 28, means second-class mail will be delivered on a three-day or two-day alternating weekly schedule. Royal Mail, which has seen letter volumes plummet from 20 billion in 2004 to 6.6 billion last year, welcomed the move to ensure financial sustainability. However, the decision was criticized by consumer and business groups who fear it will lead to less reliable service and greater reliance on more expensive first-class mail.

          <p>Dispatch audio from the recent catastrophic flooding in Kerr County, Texas, reveals that a request for an emergency alert was made by a firefighter at 4:22 a.m., but county officials did not send the first alert until 90 minutes later. Some messages through the CodeRED system didn't arrive until after 10 a.m., hours after the initial request and after floodwaters had already swept many people away. The delay raises serious questions about the county's emergency response procedures, as officials had previously touted the system's ability to notify the entire county in minutes. The Kerr County Sheriff has declined to comment on the delay, stating a review will be conducted after rescue efforts conclude.</p>

          <p>American consumers are feeling the impact of President Trump's trade war, reporting price increases on basic necessities like t-shirts and underwear. Retailers, particularly department stores like Macy's, are struggling with new tariffs on imported goods and are passing some of the increased costs to customers. A recent deal with Vietnam, a major apparel manufacturer, still imposes a 20% tariff, ensuring costs will rise. While stores are using sales to attract customers, many shoppers on a budget find that even clearance prices are higher than before, forcing retailers into a difficult balancing act of managing costs without alienating their customer base.

He described the industry's efforts to downplay climate change as the "biggest and most malevolent propaganda operation" in U.S. history, designed to protect massive subsidies. Whitehouse asserts that since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling, the industry's political influence has stifled any serious bipartisan climate action in the Senate. He urges Democrats to be more aggressive in exposing this influence, believing that public anger over being misled can be a powerful motivator for demanding stronger climate policies.</p>

The controversy puts a spotlight on the EU's enforcement of its Digital Services Act, under which X (formerly Twitter) is already being investigated.

English has been Liberia's official language since its founding in the 19th century as a nation for free Black Americans.
