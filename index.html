          <p>The Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway between Oman and Iran, is critical for global oil transport. Approximately 20 million barrels of crude, condensate, and fuels pass through it daily. Heightened tensions between Israel and Iran have raised concerns about shipping security and potential disruptions to oil flows. While there haven't been major attacks on commercial shipping, shipowners are increasingly cautious, and electronic interference with navigation systems has increased. Disruption could cause a sharp rise in crude prices, especially affecting Asian importers like China, India, Japan, and South Korea.</p>

Boelter is accused of killing Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounding another state senator and his wife. Authorities say Boelter stalked his victims and planned the attacks. The motive remains under investigation, but some officials express concern over political rhetoric and extremism.</p>
