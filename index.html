          <p>A New York court's ruling against Trump's blanket tariffs has sparked debate about its implications for the UK-US trade deal, though an appeals court paused the ruling. While the ruling blocks tariffs on some UK goods like salmon and whisky, it does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. The UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, but its implementation is pending. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest confidently, adding another layer of unpredictability to international trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in locking away climate-warming greenhouse gases. Saltmarshes, which have been significantly reduced due to agriculture, act as natural carbon sinks by capturing carbon dioxide in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these habitats in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. By formally recognizing their importance, the WWF hopes to incentivize the restoration and protection of saltmarsh ecosystems, emphasizing their significance for climate mitigation.</p>

          <p>In 1955, the U.S. deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, who then helped China develop its missile program. Qian's work enabled China to challenge American dominance in Asia and ushered in generations of Chinese scientific breakthroughs. The deportation serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting how xenophobia and shortsightedness can have significant geopolitical consequences. The article argues against current efforts to revoke visas of Chinese students in critical fields, citing Qian's story as an example of how such actions can backfire and undermine American interests.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated discussions on legislation that would allow married couples to maintain separate surnames, marking the first such debate in 28 years. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three bills submitted by opposition parties remains uncertain due to resistance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The LDP expresses concerns that the change could undermine family cohesion and traditional values, while a Kyodo News poll indicates that 71% of respondents favor the dual family-name system, highlighting a significant divergence between public opinion and political action.</p>

The festival has also adapted to changing times, with the installation of a "super fence" in 2002 to combat gatecrashers and the inclusion of hip-hop headliners like Jay-Z in 2008, and Stormzy in 2019.

          <p>India's federal finance ministry is requesting the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ease proposed new regulations on gold loans. The ministry wants to ensure that small gold loan borrowers are not negatively affected by the stricter rules. Specifically, it suggests excluding borrowers with loans below 200,000 rupees from the tighter regulations to facilitate timely loan disbursement. The ministry also proposes delaying the implementation of the new rules until January 1, 2026, to allow lenders adequate preparation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of a major crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal comes as the Trump administration signals a more crypto-friendly stance, with the Justice Department shutting down its crypto enforcement team. Binance is also forging ties with World Liberty Financial, a crypto project with links to the Trump family, indicating a potential shift in the regulatory environment for digital assets.</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case involving seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona. The decision was made after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism surrounding her participation in a documentary series about the case. The court ruled that a new trial would be held, with three new judges selected by lottery, casting doubt on the timeline of the proceedings. The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death in November 2020.</p>

Excluding China from Swift could prompt countries to shift to China's alternative settlement system, CIPS, undermining Swift's dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
