          <p>A Florida woman escaped from a storage container where she was held after allegedly being brutally sexually assaulted and beaten by David Earl Gipson, who has since been apprehended. The victim reported that Gipson attacked her at her residence, binding, gagging, and threatening her before sexually assaulting her with a handgun and a blunt object. She managed to free herself from the container, where she was left naked and hog-tied, and was aided by a passerby who called 911. Authorities also discovered the body of the victim's mother-in-law, Lettie Cooper Collins, at her home, and Gipson faces murder charges in connection to her death as well.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris re-emerged into the political sphere with a speech criticizing President Trump's policies during his first 100 days in office, particularly focusing on tariffs and government cuts. Speaking at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, Harris accused the Trump administration of abandoning American ideals and fostering fear, while highlighting the courage of those protesting his policies. She framed Trump's tariffs as a "man-made economic crisis," hurting workers and businesses, and suggested that things might worsen before improving, urging Americans to stand together. Harris's speech fuels speculation about her potential run for California governor or a future presidential bid in 2028.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Ukraine have finalized an agreement allowing the US to share in future revenues from Ukraine's mineral reserves, establishing a joint investment fund between the two countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the deal signals commitment to a free and prosperous Ukraine, while Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed Ukraine will retain full control over its resources and infrastructure. This agreement, intended to give Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate, follows months of tense negotiations, and is designed to address concerns about the U.S. providing Kyiv with unconditional financial support. The deal is viewed by some as a way to entice Trump to support Ukraine and secure future military backing.</p>

          <p>Eleven students involved in an alleged hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team turned themselves in after facing a deadline to avoid kidnapping charges. The incident involved older players allegedly luring younger teammates to an isolated area, where accomplices staged an abduction, tying up one student and placing him in a car trunk. No injuries were reported, but the district attorney described the event as "hazing on steroids" and acknowledged the potential for tragedy, while the school district is cooperating with law enforcement in the ongoing investigation. The students' attorney said the young men deeply regret their involvement in what began as a misguided attempt at a prank.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The central bank now expects Japan's economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a significant decrease from the 1.1 percent projected in January, and decided against another hike in interest rates. This decision reflects concerns that President Trump's tariffs are weighing on economic prospects, exacerbating pressures on an already fragile economy struggling with weak consumption and persistent inflation. The bank's decision to hold interest rates steady underscores the challenges posed by tariffs to its efforts to normalize monetary policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with China, stating there is a "very good chance" of an agreement, even as his trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, indicated that no trade discussions were currently underway.

          <p>As the United States retreats from its traditional role of global leadership, Asia is adapting to a new reality where China's influence is growing, as reflected in an opinion piece from the New York Times. President Trump's policies, including tariff threats and cuts to foreign aid, have led to a perceived decline in American influence, particularly in regions like Myanmar where China has stepped in to provide assistance. Despite this shift, American ideals and cultural influence continue to resonate in Asia, and some countries express a desire for continued U.S. engagement, even as they navigate a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>

China-India ties had been improving after border clashes, but analysts suggest that India's economic deal with Washington and ongoing regional tensions may pose challenges. President Trump announced a 26% tariff rate on Indian imports earlier this month, leading to quick movement on an economic deal with Washington.

          <p>A California Assembly committee has amended a controversial bill that aimed to end solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, narrowing its scope to only apply to those who sell their homes. The original bill, AB 942, sought to limit the program's benefits to 10 years, but the committee removed this provision after opposition from rooftop solar owners, schools, and environmental groups. The bill's author, Lisa Calderon, argued that the financial credits given to rooftop solar owners are raising electric bills for those without panels, and that the bill is about fairness and equity.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has reported a decline in digital ad spending from Chinese online retailers in response to President Donald Trump's trade policies. According to Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, this reduction is likely due to the ending of de minimis trade exemptions for Chinese imports, which benefited companies like Temu and Shein. Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region were below Wall Street projections for the first quarter, and the company expects headwinds to its advertising business, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>After months of contentious negotiations, Washington and Kyiv have signed a long-awaited deal involving Ukraine's natural resources. Both sides have confirmed that it sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and sets outs how revenues would be split. In a statement, the US said the agreement "signals to Russia" that the Trump administration is "committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous" Ukraine.
