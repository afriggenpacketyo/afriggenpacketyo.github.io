          <p>A recent report detailing suspected Chinese surveillance sites in Cuba has prompted a congressional hearing, where lawmakers expressed concerns about China's expanding intelligence presence near the US. Researchers used satellite imagery to identify four suspected signals intelligence facilities in Cuba, including one near Bejucal undergoing upgrades. This site, known for surveillance since the Cold War, now features advanced antennas capable of monitoring military and commercial activity across the southeastern US, raising alarms about potential security threats and the need for a stronger US response. Relevant context includes heightened geopolitical tensions between the US and China.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty, the winner of the 151st Kentucky Derby, will not compete in the Preakness Stakes, as announced by trainer Bill Mott, who cited the horse's long-term interests. The decision marks the seventh consecutive year without a Triple Crown winner. Mott indicated that Sovereignty will instead focus on the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on June 7, sparking debate about the spacing of the Triple Crown races. Prominent owner Mike Repole proposed moving the Belmont to second in the order to allow more recovery time for the horses.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration may enforce a ban on transgender troops serving in the military while challenges to the ban proceed in lower courts. The ruling, which was brief and unsigned, allows the policy to take effect despite lower court rulings that had blocked it. The court's liberal members dissented without providing reasoning. The case concerns an executive order revoking President Biden's policy allowing transgender service members to serve openly, with the administration arguing that the ban is necessary for military readiness and unit cohesion.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that being locked out of China's AI market would be a "tremendous loss," estimating the market's value at $50 billion in the next few years. He emphasized the potential for revenue, taxes, and job creation in the US if Nvidia could sell into China, but noted the company would support whatever policies the government deems best. This comes after the Trump administration restricted the shipment of Nvidia's H20 chips to China, leading to a $5.5 billion quarterly charge. Huang also acknowledged Huawei as a formidable competitor in AI, with the article providing context on US-China trade tensions and Nvidia's financial performance.</p>

The leaders discussed trade and security issues, but no major breakthroughs were expected, as the relationship between the two countries has been strained since Trump's re-election.

          <p>Columbia University's administrators and trustees have ordered a review of the university senate, a move that could redefine control of student demonstrations. The review comes after accusations that the senate delayed and obstructed discipline of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and amid targeting of Columbia by the White House, which has stripped the school of $400 million in federal funds. The effort to potentially diminish the university senate’s authority represents the latest convulsion in a year of demonstrations and resignations. The article also highlights the ideological divide between faculty members and trustees.</p>

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely emphasize that everything is on the table, but policymakers are unsure about the future.
