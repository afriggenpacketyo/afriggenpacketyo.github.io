            <h2>Trump's Trade Goals Remain Unclear Amidst Tariff Volatility</h2>

            <p>After a week of dramatic tariff announcements and reversals, it's uncertain if Trump is closer to his trade goals. While some countries are negotiating deals, instability makes it difficult for industries to commit to long-term investments. Trump aims to confront China and raise revenue through tariffs, but this strategy carries risks and may alienate allies. The pause in tariffs offers a 90-day window for trade agreements, but the long-term effects on American industry and consumer prices remain to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The European Union is finding itself in a stronger negotiating position with China as the US and China engage in a trade war. After France issued an ultimatum regarding tariffs on cognac, China paused permanent duties, signaling a potential shift in power dynamics. With the US imposing significant tariffs on China, Europe perceives an opportunity to exert greater influence. This situation highlights the complex interplay of global trade relations and the potential for new alliances and strategies to emerge.</p>

            <p>This article suggests that Trump's partial reversal on tariffs was due to market pressure, not diplomacy, and that Europe should not grovel. The author argues that Europe overestimates US power and should act as an alternative to US unpredictability. They advocate for strengthening the euro and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. The piece suggests that Europe should seize the opportunity to become a leader in clean tech and promote its stability as a counterpoint to the US's erratic policies.</p>

She invested in companies like Lululemon, Dell Computer, and Amazon. Some of her bets have proven successful after markets rebounded following Trump's decision to pause tariffs. This raises questions about potential conflicts of interest, as lawmakers can influence companies through their positions in office. (not investment advice)</p>
