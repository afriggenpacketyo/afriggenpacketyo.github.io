            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, a man deported due to an administrative error, and reported that Garcia was "traumatized" by his experience at CECOT, a Salvadoran supermax prison. Garcia, who was initially held in a cell with 25 others, expressed fear due to taunting from prisoners in other cell blocks. Despite improved conditions at a new detention center in Santa Ana, Garcia remains isolated with no access to news or communication with the outside world. Van Hollen called on El Salvador's Vice President to release Garcia and not be complicit in the Trump administration's actions, emphasizing the need to uphold due process.</p>

            <p>Christian leaders are imploring the Trump administration to reconsider the deportation of Afghan Christians, arguing they face severe persecution, torture, or death under Taliban rule. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is ending humanitarian parole for approximately 9,000 Afghans, including hundreds of Christians who converted after the U.S. withdrawal in 2021. Advocates are requesting a 90-day pause on deportations to allow for legal pathways or protections, citing the targeting of Christians by the Taliban, where conversion from Islam is punishable by death. Rev. Franklin Graham indicated a possible extension to July for resolving visa issues, though DHS has not confirmed this publicly.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is moving to reclassify thousands of federal workers as "at-will" employees, making it easier to fire them by stripping away civil service protections. The proposed rule aims to affect approximately 50,000 federal workers, or about 2% of the workforce, who work on policy matters. President Trump stated that government workers who refuse to advance the president's policy interests or engage in corrupt behavior should no longer have a job. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the administration, arguing the move will undermine the merit-based hiring system.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly cancelled plans to assist Texas schools in curbing measles outbreaks due to potential staff layoffs. The CDC had considered expanding its onsite assessment services, previously offered to hospitals, to schools in Texas. This decision follows the elimination of a large portion of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) staff, including experts involved in ventilation assessments. The layoffs have impacted the CDC's ability to respond to health hazard evaluations and other emergency situations requiring engineering or ventilation expertise.</p>

Duran's lawyers argued that sheriff's deputies framed him for the crime, and the only eyewitness recanted her testimony, stating she lied on the stand. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office conceded there was evidence of “actual innocence,” leading to Duran's release from prison in 2022. This ruling clears the way for Duran to seek state compensation for his wrongful imprisonment.</p>

            <p>This article explores the use of dark humor as a coping mechanism in times of political repression and authoritarianism, drawing parallels to historical examples such as sarcastic jokes during Francisco Franco's regime and Yiddish humor in 1930s Poland. It suggests that satire and mockery can undermine the appearance of inevitability that authoritarians depend on. The article also discusses how authoritarian leaders can use humor for their own political purposes, and how humor can be a tool of resistance against cruel totalitarian laughter. In a time of high political tension, macabre jokes acknowledge their own limitations and offer a form of self-defense.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status amid a dispute over federal funding and concerns about antisemitism on campus. While the federal government has long exempted universities from taxes, history shows that revoking such status is not a simple or quick process. The case of Bob Jones University, which had its tax-exempt status rescinded due to discriminatory policies, serves as a legal precedent. Legal experts believe Harvard would have a strong defense against such action, as it does not have an official policy of antisemitism.</p>
