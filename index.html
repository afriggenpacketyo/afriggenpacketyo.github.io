          <p>The article discusses the "pink tax" and "pink tariffs", highlighting how tariffs disproportionately affect women due to gendered pricing and product categorization in the US.  It explores the historical context of these tariffs and the significant financial burden they place on women, suggesting that this gender bias is a result of decades-old negotiations dominated by men.  Experts call for increased transparency in tariff rates to raise awareness and encourage change.</p>

          <p>A poll reveals growing American concern over Donald Trump's tariff policies, despite his assurances.  While Republicans show less concern than Democrats and Independents, a significant majority across the political spectrum express worry about the economic impact of these tariffs, including potential recession and years of recovery time.  The poll highlights a partisan divide in views on the economy and the justification for tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>Severe storms across the southern US resulted in numerous deaths and widespread damage.  Separately, the Trump administration deported approximately 250 Venezuelans accused of gang affiliation to El Salvador, despite a federal judge's attempt to halt the deportations.  A separate legal challenge involves the deportation of a doctor from Boston, raising concerns about a broader immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's attacks on higher education, particularly funding cuts to research, are causing widespread concern within academia. While some argue that a reduction in PhD programs is necessary, the abrupt and chaotic nature of these cuts is causing significant harm. The article explores the potential long-term consequences of these cuts, including the loss of a generation of researchers and the overall damage to the US scientific enterprise.</p>

          <p>The OECD has lowered its economic growth forecasts for both the US and the global economy, citing increased trade barriers and geopolitical uncertainty as major factors.  The projections assume further tariff increases between the US, Canada, and Mexico.  The report suggests that even with lower tariff increases, global growth would still be weaker than previously anticipated.</p>
