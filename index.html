          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was murdered a week prior, drew tens of thousands of mourners to State Farm Stadium in Arizona. The event featured speeches from prominent figures including President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Dr. Ben Carson. Speakers at the service, which was described by some as a revival, referred to Kirk as a "martyr" whose "sacrifice" would yield positive outcomes for the conservative movement. The large, upbeat crowd reflects the significant impact Kirk had, particularly on young conservatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City narrowly missed a victory against Arsenal after a late equalizer resulted in a 1-1 draw, a result that benefits league-leader Liverpool. Manager Pep Guardiola employed an uncharacteristically defensive 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead, a strategy that almost succeeded but was undone in the 93rd minute. This tactical shift, which gave City its lowest-ever possession statistic under Guardiola, was attributed to player fatigue after a demanding week of matches. The draw leaves both teams trailing in the title race.</p>

          <p>Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory over Sam Houston State. Manning accounted for five touchdowns, throwing for 309 yards and three scores while also rushing for two more. After one of his rushing touchdowns, he engaged in a brief taunt with a defender, an act he later admitted was fueled by frustration from recent struggles. Teammates and coaches noted his restored "swagger" and looser play style, which contributed to his standout performance.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats have accused President Donald Trump of steering the United States toward a dictatorship following his public demands for the Justice Department to prosecute political rivals. The warnings were amplified after the administration was also perceived as influencing the removal of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel from the air. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that turning the Justice Department into an instrument against political enemies is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. The concerns highlight growing fears over the administration's use of federal power against its critics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan to bring Gatwick Airport's northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The privately-financed project is intended to boost economic growth, increase flight capacity significantly, and create jobs. The approval comes after the airport agreed to stricter noise controls and measures to manage road traffic to mitigate local impact. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups who argue it will increase pollution and climate emissions.</p>

          <p>Protests occurred across all of Brazil's states against legislative proposals that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for their roles in a 2023 coup attempt. The demonstrations, supported by prominent artists, were sparked by a bill that could pardon those involved in the uprising. This legislative push follows Bolsonaro's recent conviction and 27-year prison sentence for attempting to overturn the 2022 election. The widespread protests reflect ongoing deep political divisions within the country.</p>

          <p>Iranian engineer and labor rights activist Sharifeh Mohammadi has been sentenced to death for a third time on charges of "armed rebellion against the state."

          <p>The mother of a freed British-Israeli hostage has criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it rewards Hamas. Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily was held captive for 15 months, stated the timing is inappropriate while hostages remain in Gaza and Hamas retains power. Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the move, asserting it is not a reward for the terrorist group but an effort to reignite hope for a two-state solution.

Norris attributed his qualifying position to a strategic decision and a minor error, stating that in a race where overtaking was nearly impossible, his starting place determined his result.

          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director under President Trump, has stated that the U.S. job market is showing signs of degradation, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. Speaking after the Fed's recent interest rate cut, Cohn pointed to a slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 to under 50,000 per month. He attributes this trend to companies aggressively managing labor costs in a difficult economic environment with rising input costs. Cohn suggests businesses have shifted from "hoarding labor" post-pandemic to actively reducing their workforce through natural attrition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage due to a new payment structure. For the first time, American players will receive a $500,000 payment for participating, while the European team continues to play without compensation. Donald believes that if the highly-paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on them. He emphasized that the European players are motivated by purpose and tradition, not monetary reward.</p>

          <p>The assembly line for China's first domestically developed passenger jet, the C919, employs a sophisticated "smart factory" system to ensure production quality and avoid errors. The system integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker, creating a unified intelligent loop for sensing, communication, and control. This advanced manufacturing approach is designed to prevent the kinds of quality control lapses, such as missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft, that have affected other major aerospace manufacturers. The technology represents a significant step in China's ambitions in the commercial aviation sector.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Trump's efforts to consolidate authoritarian power are being undermined by his administration's declining public support. Worsening economic indicators, such as rising grocery prices and stalled job growth, are eroding his political capital. This makes it more difficult for him to pressure officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi to take legally questionable actions against his political opponents. The analysis suggests that as public discontent grows, collaborators may become less willing to risk their own futures for a president whose hold on power appears to be weakening.</p>

Development Minister Reen Alabali Radovan acknowledged that in a time of increasing global crises, Germany is investing far less than needed.

The reduction in German funding follows even larger cuts to humanitarian aid by the United States, exacerbating a global shortfall.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-setting rally could continue. They argue that the current market, heavily influenced by AI-driven productivity gains and strong earnings in the tech sector, is fundamentally different from historical precedents. While valuations are high, analysts suggest they are justified by higher profit margins and return on equity compared to past eras. However, some caution that further rate cuts could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than solid fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. Stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes, which naturally shrink as we age. This process can be reversed, however, by adopting daily practices to manage stress and promote cellular restoration. Epel recommends simple lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to create an anti-inflammatory lifestyle and slow aging.</p>

Party leader Sir Ed Davey suggested "times have changed" and that a modern digital ID system, like one he observed in Estonia, could potentially increase citizens' freedom by improving access to public services. The shift in thinking comes as the ruling Labour government is reportedly planning to introduce its own digital ID scheme. The proposal remains divisive within the party, with many members still holding strong concerns about civil liberties and data security.</p>
