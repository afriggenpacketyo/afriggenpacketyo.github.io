          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre's family states she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew, claims which Andrew has denied, and filed a lawsuit against him that was later settled out of court. Giuffre's attorney described her as a dear friend and champion for other victims, highlighting her courage and strength. Giuffre also formed a nonprofit called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR) to educate and advocate for sex trafficking victims.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is demanding answers regarding the possible deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras alongside her mother and sister. The judge expressed strong suspicion that the government deported the child without due process.

Despite the family's attorney informing ICE that the girl was a U.S. citizen and providing a birth certificate, the deportation proceeded, prompting the judge to schedule a hearing to investigate the matter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple who were legally in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status (TPS), criticizing the government's attempt to deport them based on alleged gang affiliation. The judge accused the government of lacking meaningful evidence to support the claim that the couple were members of a gang. The couple had fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted TPS in 2024, but their status was later withdrawn due to the alleged gang association. The judge barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without giving them 21 days notice.</p>

More than 29,200 hectares have been burned, exceeding the previous high of 28,100 hectares in 2019. Prolonged dry and sunny weather in March and early April created ideal conditions for widespread burning. Most fires are started by humans, but favorable weather conditions can make it easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly. Scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world.</p>

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a longtime loyalist, as his deputy, a move seen by some as signaling al-Sheikh as his preferred successor. The appointment comes as the war in Gaza continues and a sweeping Israeli military operation in the West Bank displaces thousands. Some Palestinians view the leadership's focus on internal politics as a sign of complacency amidst the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis. The appointment is viewed as a cosmetic reshuffle to placate Arab officials frustrated by the Palestinian leader.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by significant disruptions to global trade, including tariff increases for both rivals and allies. While some tariffs were temporarily reduced, the back-and-forth between Washington and Beijing has failed to restore confidence in the U.S.'s ability to manage the global economy. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies has created instability and anxiety among investors and business leaders. The long-term impact of these policies remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras, sparking outrage and legal challenges. A federal judge has questioned the legality of the deportation, citing a lack of due process. In a separate case, the mother of a one-year-old girl was also deported, separating them indefinitely. The ACLU and other groups condemn the deportations as a shocking abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The FBI’s arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has triggered strong reactions from Republican and Democratic politicians, as the Trump administration veered closer to direct confrontation with the judiciary over its crackdown on immigration. Republicans have called for her removal while Democrats regard her arrest as a reflection of the administration’s increasing disregard of judicial independence amid its push to deport immigrants on an enormous scale. The arrest of a sitting judge has ignited a debate over the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary.</p>
