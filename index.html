            <p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) raised $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2025, marking her strongest fundraising quarter to date, as revealed in a recent campaign finance filing. This surge in donations coincides with her 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour alongside Senator Bernie Sanders, where they criticize President Trump's policies and the influence of billionaires like Elon Musk. AOC's campaign manager highlighted that a majority of the donations came from first-time donors, with an average donation of just $21, emphasizing the grassroots support behind her. These funds will support organizing efforts in her district and rallies across the country, signaling a continued challenge to the established Democratic leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A doctor in Berlin faces murder charges for allegedly killing 15 patients under palliative care, driven by what prosecutors describe as a "lust" for murder. The doctor, part of a nursing service's end-of-life care team, is accused of administering anesthetics and muscle relaxants without consent, leading to respiratory arrest. The victims ranged in age from 25 to 94, with most dying in their own homes. The case is reminiscent of other instances of medical professionals abusing their positions, raising concerns about patient safety and oversight in palliative care settings.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates have risen to their highest level since February, leading homebuyers to seek riskier adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to lower monthly payments.

This shift reflects borrowers' attempts to manage affordability amid higher home prices and economic uncertainty. While ARMs offer lower initial rates, they carry the risk of future rate adjustments, potentially increasing monthly payments later in the loan term. (not investment advice)</p>

This move comes as inflation in the Eurozone approaches the ECB's 2% target, while regional economic growth remains sluggish.

            <p>The UK inflation rate has eased for the second consecutive month, reaching 2.6% in March, primarily due to falling petrol and toy prices. However, analysts predict this is a temporary dip, with inflation expected to climb above 3% in April due to rising household bills and business costs. The impact of Donald Trump's tariff policies and the performance of the UK economy will also play a significant role in future inflation trends. While there are expectations of a UK-US trade deal, the potential for cheap Chinese products to flood the UK market could also affect inflation rates.</p>

This decision follows Trump's broader attacks on higher education, including scrutiny of universities for alleged antisemitism.

Experts warn that these numbers could rise, especially with the dismantling of USAID, potentially leading to 200,000 additional polio cases causing paralysis each year. Challenges in Pakistan include vaccine distrust, access issues due to conflict, and the need for improved vaccination strategies, while Afghanistan faces obstacles due to Taliban restrictions and bans on women's employment in health sectors.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk and Doge's "initial survey" into unemployment benefits, revealing instances of deceased or underage claimants, has been criticized as rehashing old findings from the Biden era. Experts argue that the claims, attributed to Doge and amplified by right-wing media, are based on publicly available data from the Department of Labor's office of inspector general. The Department of Labor had already identified potential fraud involving individuals over 100 or under the age of 14 receiving unemployment benefits and taken measures to address it. Critics suggest that Doge's claims are a distraction from the need to improve unemployment insurance systems for future economic downturns.</p>

            <p>California has launched a legal challenge against President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he has overstepped his authority and is threatening trade in the state. The lawsuit, brought by Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, contends that Trump's invocation of emergency powers to impose tariffs without congressional consent is illegal. California relies heavily on trade with Mexico, Canada, and China, and the state's economy is expected to suffer significantly from Trump's tariff policies. The complaint seeks to have Trump's tariff orders declared unlawful and void.</p>

            <p>Supplies of new and used vehicles in the U.S. are rapidly declining as consumers rush to purchase cars and trucks ahead of potential price increases due to tariffs. The days' supply of new vehicles has dropped significantly, and used vehicle supply is also down. This surge in sales is good for the automotive industry in the short term, but there are concerns that sales could come to a halt once automakers and dealers sell out of their tariff-free inventories. Higher production costs and other factors are expected to result in fewer vehicles sold annually in the U.S. and Canada.</p>

            <p>In his first speech since leaving the White House, Joe Biden accused Donald Trump and Elon Musk of “taking a hatchet” to social security, citing planned staff cuts and office closures.

He criticized the potential impact of these changes, questioning how the administration could sleep at night knowing the distress they would cause.

The court emphasized that the need for restricting freedom of speech must be "established convincingly" and was not adequately demonstrated by the NHS trusts involved. The ruling stems from disputes over life support treatment for two children, Isaiah Haastrup and Zainab Abbasi, and allows their parents to publicly discuss the doctors involved in their care.
