          <h2>Airbnb Issues Disappointing Revenue Guidance for Second Quarter Amid Economic Uncertainties</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airbnb's first-quarter earnings aligned with expectations, but the company's revenue forecast for the second quarter disappointed investors, causing shares to decline. The company expects revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, slightly below the $3.04 billion anticipated by analysts. Airbnb cited "relatively softer results" in the U.S. due to broader economic uncertainties, despite strong year-over-year growth in North America. The company noted softness in travel from Canada to the U.S. toward the end of the quarter, but experienced strong demand for Easter travel from Latin America, its fastest-growing region.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), reported first-quarter revenue of $29.27 billion, which was below the StreetAccount analyst consensus of $29.42 billion marking the third consecutive quarter of revenue misses for AWS. Despite this, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, exceeding the $10.52 billion consensus and achieving its widest operating margin since at least 2014. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted that the cost of AI for customers will decrease over time due to Amazon's custom chips, which offer an alternative to Nvidia GPUs. During the quarter, AWS launched a video game streaming service and established an agentic artificial intelligence group.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is stepping down from his White House position, with President Trump planning to nominate him as the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a decision made at the last minute. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Waltz's departure follows scrutiny over a Signal chat incident and perceived issues with vetting NSC staff, though Trump respects Waltz and is offering him a high-profile new role. Waltz's nomination will require Senate confirmation, with potential for a challenging hearing given the previous Signal incident.</p>

          <p>Apple's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, although the Services division's revenue slightly missed estimates. iPhone revenue was $46.84 billion, exceeding expectations, while Mac and iPad sales also performed well. CEO Tim Cook noted that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, to mitigate tariff impacts.

          <p>Amazon reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, driven by strong growth in its cloud computing and advertising businesses.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the Alien Enemies Act does not authorize President Trump to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ruling, by Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., is the first broad injunction against using the 1798 act to deport alleged gang members. The judge stated that the president's invocation of the AEA exceeded the statute's scope, as it requires an organized armed attack or a threat from a foreign nation. This decision only applies to migrants detained in the southern district of Texas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., plans to require placebo-controlled studies for new vaccines, a move that could delay the availability of future COVID-19 vaccines and complicate the approval process for other vaccines. Kennedy's office argues this is to ensure vaccine safety, but vaccine experts dispute the claim that key vaccines weren't tested against placebos. Critics like Dr. Paul Offit view this as an attempt to undermine confidence in vaccines, while others argue that given existing immunity levels, new placebo trials for updated COVID vaccines would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.

          <p>The death toll from sectarian violence in Syria has exceeded 100, according to a war monitoring group, as unrest spreads to new areas. Violence began in Jaramana after an audio clip surfaced, allegedly of a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad, leading to attacks by Sunni Muslim extremist groups on Druse populations. Clashes have expanded to Sweida, a Druse-controlled region, raising fears of further fracturing in the country. Israel has also launched airstrikes in response to attacks on Syrian Druse civilians.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a deal that would significantly weaken oversight of religious schools, potentially benefiting the Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal, possibly part of a state budget agreement, has raised concerns among education experts, including State Education Commissioner Betty Rosa, who called the changes a "travesty" for children attending schools without basic secular education. The potential deal involves lowering standards for schools to demonstrate compliance with state law, primarily affecting Hasidic schools that conduct religious lessons in Yiddish and Hebrew.</p>

          <p>A fourth round of Iran-US talks over Tehran's nuclear program has been postponed, with both sides citing "logistical and technical reasons." The postponement comes after President Trump threatened action against those buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals, following fresh sanctions on companies linked to Tehran. Despite the delay, both sides appear eager to avoid war, although reports from Tehran suggest growing doubt about the usefulness of the talks. The US State Department said it expects the next round to take place "in the near future".</p>

          <p>Nvidia and Anthropic engaged in a public disagreement over U.S. chip export restrictions, with Nvidia criticizing Anthropic's defense of tighter controls on AI chips. Anthropic argued for stricter enforcement, claiming Chinese smuggling tactics involved hiding chips in "prosthetic baby bumps" and "packed alongside live lobsters." Nvidia countered that American firms should focus on innovation rather than rely on such claims. The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips to prevent rival nations like China from advancing in AI.</p>

The ruling, applying only to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases involving the Alien Enemies Act. The judge determined that the president's claims about the Tren de Aragua gang did not constitute an "invasion" as defined by the act.</p>
