          <p>A 38-year-old man from Brooklyn, Sheldon John, died after being stabbed during a fight on a No. 5 subway train in Manhattan. The altercation started when one man stepped on the other's shoe, leading to an argument that escalated into a stabbing. The victim was stabbed multiple times and pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital after officers found him unconscious on the platform with chest wounds. This incident highlights the ongoing concerns about safety within the New York City subway system.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are urging for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, with Senator Ed Markey criticizing the tariffs as "recklessly imposed."

Some business owners are already facing the possibility of abandoning orders due to increased costs.

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, this article provides an overview of the major militant groups operating in the region, including The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Al Badr, and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH). These groups aim to challenge control over Indian-administered regions of Kashmir and, in many cases, merge the region with Pakistan. Some have ties to global jihadi networks and have fought alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The fluid nature of the militant landscape makes it difficult to track and contain the insurgency.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has revoked a Biden administration policy that restricted subpoenas of reporters' phone records in criminal investigations. Bondi argues that federal employees who leak sensitive information are engaging in conduct that could be considered "treasonous." While acknowledging the importance of a free press, Bondi stated that the Justice Department will not tolerate disclosures that undermine President Trump's policies.

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing its decision to terminate visas for hundreds of foreign students, a move that had caused widespread fear and confusion across U.S. universities. Many of the affected students had participated in political protests or had previous minor criminal charges. The Justice Department told a federal court that records would be restored in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS). However, ICE maintains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons, such as failing to maintain nonimmigrant status.</p>

This decision follows a similar ruling in Georgia, where a judge ordered the reinstatement of visas for 133 international students.

          <p>Chelsea forward Cole Palmer's goalless run is attributed to mental factors by manager Enzo Maresca. Palmer, who previously scored 14 goals in 23 games, has not scored in 16 games, despite having more shots than any other Premier League player during this period. Maresca believes Palmer is worried about helping the team and struggling mentally, but remains confident that he will start scoring again. The team's performance and ability to win games are seen as key factors in Palmer's return to form.</p>
