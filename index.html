          <p>Grant Napear, the former Sacramento Kings broadcaster fired in 2020 for an "All Lives Matter" tweet, has secured a new weekday radio show in Sacramento. In a recent interview, Napear stated that many prominent figures in sports media privately expressed outrage and support but were too afraid of public backlash to defend him openly. He described the difficult experience of being ostracized and the five-year wait to return to the industry he loves. The article frames his new opportunity as a significant personal and professional rectification after the contentious dismissal.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin very shortly to discuss a potential ceasefire plan for the war in Ukraine. Trump indicated that the deal would involve a complex exchange of territories for the "betterment of both" countries, a condition Ukraine has previously rejected. The meeting follows discussions between Putin and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, where Putin reportedly expressed willingness for a ceasefire if Kyiv withdrew from the Donbass region. European officials remain skeptical about the viability of such a proposal, which would require significant Ukrainian concessions.</p>

          <p>A recent trend of fans throwing sex toys onto the court during WNBA games has led to game interruptions, player frustration, and league condemnation. Players and coaches have called the acts immature and disrespectful, viewing them as a form of sexualizing female athletes. While two individuals have been arrested in connection with these incidents, a meme-coin group called Green Dildo Coin has claimed responsibility for some, stating the stunts were intended to generate viral attention for their product. The WNBA has vowed to ban and prosecute any fan caught participating in these disruptions.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates a regional divergence in U.S. housing market trends, with home prices falling in some Southern and Western metropolitan areas while continuing to rise in the Northeast and Midwest. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops, attributed to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era construction boom and homes staying on the market longer. Conversely, markets such as New York and Milwaukee are experiencing price hikes due to tight inventory and regulations that make new construction more difficult. This supply-and-demand dynamic is creating vastly different conditions for homebuyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billy Long has been removed as IRS commissioner just two months after his Senate confirmation, with President Trump nominating him to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Iceland. His brief tenure follows a period of leadership instability and significant staff reductions at the tax agency, which has seen its workforce shrink by 25% this year under a government efficiency initiative. A former congressman with no accounting background, Long's appointment was controversial due to his past push to repeal the tax code and his advisory work for a firm linked to a fraud-ridden tax credit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily lead the agency.</p>

In response, U.S. Reform Jewish leaders also issued a statement, imploring Israel to end the war to protect hostages, soldiers, and civilians.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles police officer, Eric Halem, has been arrested on suspicion of committing a series of home burglaries in the same San Fernando Valley neighborhoods he once patrolled. Halem, who resigned from the LAPD in 2022 to become a reserve officer, was already facing separate insurance fraud charges related to an alleged scheme involving a wrecked Bentley from his luxury car rental business. Details of the burglary case are still emerging, but the arrest has heightened concerns about safety in affluent areas like Encino.

While economic growth remains relatively strong, the tariffs, combined with a recently weaker jobs report, create a challenging scenario for the Federal Reserve, which may be pulled in two directions between fighting inflation and stimulating employment.

          <p>A six-year-old boy, Enoch Palomar, was attacked by a coyote while watching his sister's softball game at a park in Carson, California. The child was bitten and scratched on his leg, head, and neck, requiring 20 stitches, before his mother ran to his aid and scared the animal away. The incident, partially captured on video by another parent, has been reported to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for investigation. While coyotes are common in the region, attacks on humans are rare, though experts note they can become less timid when conditioned to find food in human-populated areas.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary series "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. Haddix had falsely claimed that Tonka, a chimpanzee famous for roles in 1990s films, had died, in an attempt to prevent his court-ordered transfer to a sanctuary by PETA. Tonka was later found alive in a cage in her basement. The case stemmed from a lawsuit by PETA over the alleged mistreatment of several chimpanzees at her facility, and prosecutors noted her lack of remorse and continued defiance of court orders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a broad industry shift away from synthetic food dyes, spurred by the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, the whitening agent titanium dioxide is largely being overlooked. Major food companies and industry groups, while phasing out numbered dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5, have not included titanium dioxide in their pledges, arguing it is a mineral and thus distinct. This is despite the EU banning the chemical in 2022 over potential health concerns similar to those raised about other dyes. The article notes that replacing titanium dioxide is challenging, as alternatives are less effective and could alter food's taste and texture.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's military announced that its security forces killed 33 militants in an overnight operation in the Zhob district of Balochistan province, near the border with Afghanistan. The military stated the fighters were attempting to cross into Pakistan and described them as belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, also referring to them as "Indian-sponsored" without providing evidence. This operation occurs amid ongoing tensions, with Pakistan accusing both India and Afghanistan's Taliban government of supporting militant activity within its borders, claims both nations deny.

          <p>Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, sharply criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's condemnation of Israel's plan to take over Gaza City. In a social media post, Huckabee suggested that if Starmer had been prime minister during World War Two, the UK would now be "speaking German," and referenced the Allied bombing of Dresden. Starmer had called Israel's decision "wrong" and warned it would only lead to more bloodshed. The diplomatic spat highlights the deep international divisions over Israel's military strategy in Gaza, with the U.S. notably not condemning the move.</p>

          <p>Italian football club AC Milan is reportedly keen on signing Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund, just as United finalizes a deal for a new forward, Benjamin Sesko. Despite Hojlund recently stating his intent to stay at Old Trafford, increased competition may make a move possible. It is understood that Milan is proposing an initial loan deal for the Danish forward with an option to buy next summer, a structure influenced by both clubs' financial constraints due to their absence from European competition this season. The situation is expected to become clearer in the coming week.</p>

Activists gathered to protest what they allege is a covert and inhumane detention facility operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. The demonstration, one of several this week, demanded unrestricted access for officials and journalists to the site, where footage has shown detainees in overcrowded, bare rooms.

          <p>Tech giants Meta and Alphabet reported stronger-than-expected quarterly sales, largely driven by the success of their AI-powered advertising systems. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg credited AI with improving efficiency and contributing to a 22% year-over-year revenue increase, with a notable recovery in ad spending from Asia-based retailers. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, struggling with internal platform issues and advertiser uncertainty. The results underscore a growing gap where large, AI-investing companies are capturing a greater share of the digital ad market, while smaller competitors face significant pressure.

          <p>This article profiles new Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Alex Call, detailing how he transformed himself from a strikeout-prone minor leaguer into one of MLB's toughest at-bats. After a dismal 2019 season, Call dedicated himself to improving his plate discipline, using the 2020 pandemic shutdown to work on his swing and train with a virtual reality hitting system. This commitment paid off, drastically cutting his strikeout rate and helping him reach the major leagues. Now known as a "straight grinder," his ability to work counts and get on base is the key skill the Dodgers acquired at the trade deadline.</p>

The permit allows Tesla Robotaxi LLC to run a "transportation network company" anywhere in the state, including with fully autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver. The company has been running a limited, invitation-only pilot program in Austin with human-supervised vehicles, which has drawn some federal scrutiny after vehicles were observed disobeying traffic rules.
