          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to end mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted. He claims the practice is corrupt and that states must follow federal directives on election administration, a position that legal experts argue contradicts the U.S. Constitution, which grants states the authority to regulate elections. The president has also made unsubstantiated claims that the U.S. is the only country using mail-in ballots, though over 30 other nations, including Canada and the U.K., utilize the system. Election security experts assert that mail-in voting is a secure and long-standing practice in the United States, vital for many voters.</p>

          <p>Arab mediators are anticipating Israel's official response after Hamas accepted a new ceasefire proposal presented by Qatar and Egypt. The plan reportedly involves a 60-day truce, during which about half of the remaining hostages would be released while negotiations for a permanent ceasefire and the return of all others would commence. Israel's government has recently stated it would only accept a comprehensive deal for the release of all hostages and has been preparing for a potential major offensive in Gaza City. This development comes amid immense international pressure and large-scale protests within Israel urging the government to secure the hostages' return.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant portion of Americans, approximately 60%, use dietary supplements, yet the health benefits and safety of many products remain scientifically unproven. According to health experts, the industry is loosely regulated under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which allows manufacturers to make vague health claims without undergoing rigorous clinical trials required for pharmaceuticals. While some supplements like creatine can offer modest benefits when combined with specific activities, many others, such as collagen, lack convincing evidence of efficacy. Health professionals generally advise obtaining nutrients from a balanced diet unless a specific deficiency is diagnosed by a doctor.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, currently a Category 3 storm, is projected to strengthen as it moves northward in the Atlantic, parallel to the U.S. East Coast. While not expected to make landfall, the hurricane will generate dangerous rip currents and high waves, prompting warnings and some beach closures from North Carolina to New Jersey. Officials in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued evacuation orders for some areas due to the risk of significant coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center urges the public to heed local warnings, as the hazardous ocean conditions are expected to persist for much of the week along the entire coastline.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Sarah McBride of Delaware has accused President Trump of launching an "all-out assault" on American democracy. In a social media post, McBride, who is the first openly transgender person to serve in Congress, criticized the president's recent calls to ban voting machines and eliminate mail-in voting. Her comments followed Trump's announcement that he is preparing an executive order aimed at overhauling election procedures before the 2026 midterms. The president's push for these changes intensified after he claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed that mail-in voting undermines election integrity, a statement made without evidence.</p>

U.K. authorities had sought access for law enforcement purposes, but tech companies and cybersecurity experts argued that any such back door would compromise user security and be exploitable by malicious actors. This resolution could have broad implications for the global debate over encryption and may allow Apple to reintroduce its most secure cloud data services in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume operations after its flight attendants' union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), reached a tentative agreement with the airline, ending a four-day strike. The labor dispute, centered on pay and scheduling issues, had grounded hundreds of flights and affected approximately 130,000 travelers daily. The breakthrough occurred after a lengthy negotiation session with a government-appointed mediator, following the union's defiance of a back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board. The airline stated that while some flights would restart Tuesday evening, a full return to service may take several days.</p>

          <p>Following diplomatic meetings at the White House, President Trump announced that he is working to arrange a face-to-face meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate an end to the war. The development came after Trump met with Zelenskyy and several European leaders, who discussed potential U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a long-term peace agreement. While Moscow has not officially confirmed the meeting, the initiative is seen as a potential breakthrough in the nearly two-year-long conflict.

          <p>A former coach at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, a prestigious Iowa academy known for training Olympians, has been arrested by the FBI on federal charges related to child sexual abuse imagery. The coach, Sean Gardner, was suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022 following allegations of sexual abuse from at least three young gymnasts at the academy and claims he secretly recorded others at a previous job. Despite the suspension and an initial police investigation, the case remained unresolved for years, highlighting concerns about the slow and opaque disciplinary process for abuse cases in Olympic sports. The investigation was reopened in 2024 after another former student came forward.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has effectively ended the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) student loan repayment plan by resuming interest charges for all borrowers, causing financial distress for millions. Many of the 8 million people enrolled in the Biden-era plan, which offered interest forbearance, now face significantly higher monthly payments or the prospect of accruing more debt. Borrowers interviewed for this article expressed feelings of regret and anxiety, stating the changes have forced them to take on extra work, seek parental help, and delay major life plans like having children.

The embrace of cow products aligns with a broader romanticization of a bygone, agrarian era, often promoted by tradwife influencers on social media.

          <p>Recent court rulings and legal settlements allowing universities to directly pay student-athletes in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball are threatening the existence of non-revenue teams such as squash, diving, and rowing. For decades, profits from major sports subsidized these other programs, a system critics call unfair to the often-uncompensated players who generated the income. As athletic departments reallocate funds to pay star athletes, many non-revenue sports face budget cuts. This shift challenges the traditional model of college athletics, prompting a debate over whether universities should continue to fund a wide array of sports or focus resources on academics and need-based aid.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. and Europe have historically differed on free speech, particularly regarding hate speech, European governments and courts are now increasingly criminalizing expression that falls short of incitement to violence. This article argues that a trend of legislative crackdowns and court rulings is corroding free expression across the continent, targeting everything from protests to social media posts deemed offensive. Citing reports from Amnesty International and various court cases, the author suggests that by prioritizing the prevention of offense over protecting speech, Europe is sliding toward illiberalism.

The research found that gastroenterologists were about 20% less effective at identifying polyps during colonoscopies on their own after just three months of using an AI-assisted detection system. The findings suggest that doctors may subconsciously wait for the AI to flag abnormalities rather than actively searching for them.

          <p>E-commerce company Shein is reportedly considering moving its headquarters back to China from Singapore to gain Beijing's approval for a potential initial public offering in Hong Kong. The fast-fashion retailer, which sources most of its products from China, has faced significant regulatory hurdles and delays in its attempts to list publicly in London and the United States. A move back to China could be a strategic effort to align with Chinese authorities, though the discussions are said to be preliminary. The company has been navigating increasing policy headwinds in Western markets, including the removal of a key U.S. tariff exemption.</p>

          <p>After a two-week walkout to prevent a quorum, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, allowing the Republican-led legislature to resume its controversial mid-decade redistricting efforts. The Democrats fled the state to block a GOP plan, prompted by President Trump, to redraw U.S. House maps to create up to five more Republican-leaning districts ahead of the 2026 midterms. In response, California Democrats have initiated their own redistricting plan to counteract the potential gains in Texas, setting the stage for a contentious, nationwide battle over congressional maps. With the Democrats' return, the Texas redistricting proposal has now passed a key committee.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced plans to deploy 4.5 million armed militia members across the country in response to what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. The move follows the Trump administration's decision to increase the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million on drug trafficking charges and the launch of U.S. anti-drug naval operations in the Caribbean. Maduro characterized the actions as an escalation and called for the formation of additional peasant and worker militias to defend Venezuela's sovereignty. The announcement signals a significant heightening of tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking the first time it has missed on both metrics since 2014. Despite this, the home improvement retailer maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating total sales growth of 2.8% and a comparable sales increase of about 1%. The company noted that homeowners continue to show a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects due to the sluggish housing market and high borrowing costs. However, Home Depot saw positive signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the flood-prone Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to nature-based solutions to combat the increasing intensity of rainfall caused by climate change. By restoring wetlands and giving rivers more space through "depoldering," authorities are creating natural buffers that can absorb excess water during storms and release it slowly during droughts. These projects, part of a comprehensive flood management strategy known as the Sigma Plan, complement infrastructure upgrades like reinforced dikes. Initially met with resistance, the initiatives have gained local support by incorporating public access for recreation and demonstrating clear benefits for community safety.</p>

          <p>A proposal by former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt to build a gondola from Union Station to Dodger Stadium remains undecided after eight years, facing both community opposition and significant bureaucratic delays. Community members and Los Angeles City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez rallied against a state bill aimed at fast-tracking the project's legal process, arguing it benefits a billionaire developer over public interest. Hernandez highlighted the city's slow pace on public works, noting that a traffic study to evaluate alternatives to the gondola took 16 months just to solicit bids. The prolonged timeline raises broader questions about the city's ability to efficiently approve and execute major infrastructure projects.</p>

Additionally, a shareholder lawsuit accuses CEO Elon Musk of inflating stock prices by exaggerating the capabilities of the robotaxi program, which has experienced glitches during its Austin rollout. These legal challenges are intensifying scrutiny of the company's autonomous driving technology at a critical time of falling sales and increased competition.</p>

          <p>The California State University (CSU) system is facing a significant housing shortage, with an estimated 11% of its students experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. While CSU has added over 17,000 beds in the last decade, demand continues to outpace supply at many of its 22 campuses, particularly in expensive real estate markets, leaving thousands of students on waitlists. To address the crisis, the system is planning further construction and state lawmakers are considering a 2026 bond measure to fund more affordable housing projects. However, the need is uneven, as some campuses with declining enrollment have empty dorms, complicating systemwide planning.</p>

The satellite, which has been successfully monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide for over 10 years, is part of NASA's Earth science division, which faces a proposed 50% budget cut. Critics argue that destroying the highly valuable, functioning satellite instead of mothballing it represents a politically motivated effort to undermine climate science.
