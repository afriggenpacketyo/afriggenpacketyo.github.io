          <p>Republican senators allege the FBI analyzed phone records of several GOP lawmakers in 2023, as part of a probe into efforts by President Trump and allies to overturn the 2020 election results. This data, covering days around January 6, 2021, revealed call times and dates but not communication content. Senators, including Chuck Grassley, condemned the action as a "violation of personal property and constitutional rights," adding new detail to the now-shuttered Justice Department investigation. The disclosure has prompted calls for internal FBI review by Trump loyalists and raises significant concerns about government overreach and the balance of power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new article in Polar Record by Professor Jukka Tuhkuri challenges the long-held theory about the sinking of Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship, Endurance, in 1915. Tuhkuri argues the ship's loss stemmed from structural weaknesses and engineering flaws, rather than solely from the crushing pressure of the Antarctic ice. Designed for Arctic conditions, the vessel's engine room notably lacked cross-beams and diagonal bracing, rendering it vulnerable to side-to-side compression. This research, based on expedition diaries and structural analysis, offers a fresh perspective on the famous maritime mystery, suggesting Endurance's reputation for indestructibility was unwarranted.</p>

          <p>Bill Nye, joined by hundreds of space advocates at Capitol Hill, protested proposed 25% budget cuts to NASA for fiscal year 2026, warning the U.S. risks ceding leadership to countries like China. Nye, CEO of The Planetary Society, emphasized that NASA's budget is a minuscule portion of federal spending, yielding immense returns in technological advancements and the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life. He highlighted the economic benefit, asserting that every dollar invested in NASA Science returns threefold to the economy. Nye stressed the priceless value of space exploration for human history and continuous innovation.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off southwest Mexico, with forecasts predicting it will reach Category 2 status and potentially major hurricane strength. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches for parts of Baja California Sur and the Mexican coast, warning of heavy rains, gusty winds, and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Although Priscilla is expected to remain several hundred miles offshore, its outer bands could bring 2-6 inches of rain, increasing flash flooding risk in higher terrain areas. The storm, currently moving north-northwest with sustained winds of 85 mph, is expected to begin weakening by midweek.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of Citic Securities emphasizes Hong Kong's evolving role as a financial hub, asserting it should connect the broader Asia-Pacific region, not just mainland China, with the global market. He highlights the city's deep fundraising pool, capital freedom, and unique advantages under the "one country, two systems" principle as crucial for attracting listings and raising capital from across Asia. This perspective emerges as mainland capital increasingly flows into Hong Kong amid US-China decoupling, with external direct investment from the mainland exceeding 1 trillion yuan last year. The article positions Hong Kong as poised to establish itself as Asia’s primary financing hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion for U.S. farmers, particularly soybean growers impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. Discussions involving the Treasury and Agriculture Departments are in early stages, with top economic adviser Kevin Hassett promising "big measures" soon to address the issue of unsold produce. This initiative aims to alleviate the financial strain on farmers, as China, which purchased $12.6 billion in U.S. soybeans in 2024, has made no purchases this year.

          <p>Renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of the year, a historic first according to energy think tank Ember. This milestone was driven by strong growth in solar and wind power, which met all new electricity demand and slightly reduced fossil fuel use. While developing countries, especially China, led this clean energy charge, some richer nations like the US and EU increased reliance on fossil fuels. Despite these regional disparities, Ember calls this a "crucial turning point," with solar power providing the largest share of new electricity and seeing dramatic cost reductions globally.</p>

          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has directed its members to continue working during the U.S. government shutdown, despite being unpaid, warning that job actions could lead to termination. This directive comes as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reported a slight increase in sick calls among controllers, who are deemed essential workers. NATCA emphasizes the importance of maintaining professionalism and air safety, even as the shutdown creates "uncertainty and hardships" for its members. The article highlights the pre-existing nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbating the impact of the current funding lapse on airport operations and potentially causing further delays.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is set to increase parking meter prices by 50 cents per hour across its 35,000 paid spaces and extend paid parking hours, including Sundays and until midnight in nightlife areas. This move, the first rate increase in over a decade, aims to generate an estimated $14.4 million for the city's financially struggling coffers and encourage vehicle turnover for businesses. City transportation officials believe these changes will benefit the city, businesses, and motorists seeking parking. The article notes that this decision comes amidst a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, driven by legal payouts and lackluster tax revenues, and follows similar rate increases in nearby cities.</p>

Entrepreneurs hope the new plan will offer a lifeline, as they've been drained by sluggish demand, price wars, and unexpected administrative penalties.

By shedding the label, China aligns itself with the Global South, leveraging perceptions more than material advantages. This tactical retreat avoids direct clashes, yields minimal ground, and reframes the global trade battlefield in terms that favor China's long-term position, despite having already conceded some privileges in practice.
