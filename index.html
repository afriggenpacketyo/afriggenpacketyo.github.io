          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning for thunderstorms and torrential rain, with forecasters predicting more than a month's worth of rain in just a few hours. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and baked, increasing the risk of dangerous, fast-flowing flash floods. The Met Office has warned of likely disruptions to transport, potential power cuts, and the possibility of homes and businesses flooding quickly, urging residents to exercise caution.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in Pakistan as the government has warned the sons of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan against participating in planned nationwide protests for his release. An advisor to the current prime minister stated that if they break the law, they will face consequences. Khan's ex-wife, Jemima Goldsmith, accused the government of a "personal vendetta," claiming their sons were threatened with arrest if they visit. This development adds another layer to the political standoff between Khan's PTI party and the state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced at the White House that ten more hostages being held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly." This development comes as his administration continues its diplomatic push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The current proposal reportedly involves the return of these ten living hostages, along with the remains of 18 others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The news signals potential progress in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a U.S. Marine veteran, has found profound healing by bringing a wartime vision to life. To cope with the trauma of the Vietnam War, he would imagine a peaceful carousel; decades later, after battling PTSD, he spent 26 years building one. He restored a broken-down carousel and hand-carved new animals, creating the non-profit "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado. The project has delighted over a million visitors and has served as powerful medicine for Harrison himself.</p>

          <p>During a White House dinner, President Donald Trump commented on the recent military hostilities between India and Pakistan, stating that he believes "five jets were shot down actually." He did not specify which country's aircraft he was referring to or provide further details on the source of his information. The conflict, which began after an attack in Kashmir, saw both nuclear-armed nations make conflicting claims about aerial combat losses before a ceasefire was reached in May, which Trump has claimed credit for brokering.</p>

          <p>After The Wall Street Journal published a story about an alleged letter from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, many of the president's most prominent supporters have rallied to his defense. The article, which is now the subject of a lawsuit from Trump, appears to have unified his base against a common adversary: the media. This shift in sentiment follows days of criticism from some of these same figures regarding the administration's handling of the Epstein files, with many now praising Trump's subsequent call to release related grand jury testimony.</p>

CVI is a condition where veins struggle to circulate blood effectively, often managed with simple lifestyle changes like exercise and wearing compression stockings.</p>
