        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a closely watched Romanian presidential runoff, pro-European Union candidate Nicusor Dan emerged victorious against hard-right nationalist George Simion, signaling a potential shift away from skepticism toward the EU. The election, triggered by the cancelation of the previous election due to allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, saw a significant swing in voter sentiment. Dan's win is viewed as a rejection of hate and reactionary politics, embracing a pro-Western direction for Romania, although the country remains divided with a new political landscape challenging older parties to adapt. The president-elect will nominate a new prime minister and focus on national security and foreign policy. </p>

          <p>After the devastating fire in 2019, hundreds of skilled craftspeople, known as compagnons, have been working diligently to restore Notre Dame Cathedral to its former glory. These artisans, part of a medieval French organization, have employed traditional techniques to clean stained-glass windows, brighten stone walls, and recalibrate the organ's 8,000 pipes. Marble restorer Olivia Salaun meticulously recreated missing pieces of the 17th-century marquetry, while metalworker Philomene Thivet Mazzantti helped create lead ornamentation for the roof. Painting restorer Diana Castillo emphasized that the cleaning process revealed the vibrant colors that were originally present in the Middle Ages, shocking many with their intensity. </p>

          <p>Gary Lineker, the BBC's highest-paid presenter, is expected to leave the network following a social media post about Zionism that included an antisemitic image. This comes after a previous suspension in March 2023 over impartiality concerns related to a post about a government asylum policy. Lineker had announced his departure from Match of the Day in November 2024 but was set to remain with the BBC for FA Cup and World Cup coverage. Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman, and Gabby Logan have been announced as new presenters for Match of the Day starting in the 2025-26 season. </p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Gleason score is used to describe how prostate cancers look under a microscope; 9 and 10 are the most aggressive. The cancer is Stage 4, which means it has spread, but doctors say that survival rates have almost tripled in the last decade. </p>
