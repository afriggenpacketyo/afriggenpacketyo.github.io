          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia this week is seen by European observers as lending symbolic weight to the relationship between the two nations, though they acknowledge subsequent developments could be more significant. These observers caution that Beijing faces a challenging balancing act, needing to strengthen ties with Moscow during the Ukraine conflict while also maintaining closer relations with Europe. Xi's itinerary includes attending a May 9 military parade in Red Square, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The article underscores the complex diplomatic position China is navigating amidst global geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>A new report reveals that renewable energy production in the U.S. has tripled in the last decade, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the nation's energy resilience. Solar energy production is nearly eight times higher, and wind energy production has more than doubled, now powering millions of homes. However, almost $8 billion in clean energy investments have been canceled due to market uncertainty and debates over tax credits, which raises concerns about the future of renewable energy growth.

          <p>Germany's new coalition government, while committed to climate neutrality by 2045, is facing challenges in prioritizing climate action amidst economic and international pressures. Experts suggest that environment and climate protection are not high priorities for the incoming government, with potential conflicts arising between economic and environmental ministries. The decision to move domestic and international climate policy back under the environment ministry raises concerns that other ministries might neglect or reject climate-related plans.

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry brand, has cautioned that proposed U.S. tariff hikes could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry industry.

The company had previously warned of a potential revenue hit due to tariffs on countries like Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an electronic warfare device capable of creating 'ghost' fleets of warships to deceive enemy missiles. The technology, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, involves networked jammers that send signals to simulate multiple vessels, potentially diverting missiles from actual warships. The anti-ship missile targets a fleet of eight Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army warships showing on its radar, but it is not an armada â€“ it is just a single vessel. This technology could be used to trick enemy missiles into pursuing "ghost" fleets while the real warships avoided the radar entirely.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule in football, suggesting that a player should be considered onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is level with the last defender. Wenger compares the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup when the doubt benefits the striker. He believes this change is necessary to restore the advantage to the striker and address the frustration caused by VAR's precision in offside calls.</p>
