          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo who was dismissed just three games into the season. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham three months prior despite leading them to a Europa League victory, is known for his aggressive, possession-based 4-3-3 tactical system. This move signals a significant stylistic shift for Forest, which has recently invested in more technical players. The club's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, cited Postecoglou's consistent record of winning trophies as a key reason for the appointment, expressing ambition to compete for major honors.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that renaming the U.S. Department of Defense to the "Department of War" would be a costly and superficial change that undermines America's moral standing. The author contends that the focus should instead be on deep-seated institutional reforms to address the notoriously unwieldy and inefficient governing structure of the Pentagon. The current system, intended to ensure civilian oversight, often results in duplication, inter-service rivalry, and bureaucratic inertia. True improvement requires overhauling this sprawling hierarchy, not engaging in cosmetic rebranding that would cost billions without enhancing military effectiveness.</p>

This agreement highlights the sustained high demand for the powerful computing equipment necessary for training and operating advanced AI systems.

The survey of likely voters shows Mamdani with 46% support, far ahead of former Governor Andrew Cuomo at 24%. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trail with just 15% and 9% respectively. Mamdani's strong position in the polls reflects the backing he has received from prominent progressive figures like Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ahead of the November election.</p>

          <p>At least 21 people were killed and numerous others were wounded in a Russian airstrike on the village of Yarova in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. According to Ukrainian officials, the victims were civilians who had gathered to collect their pension payments from a postal service vehicle. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a ruthless act, sharing graphic footage and calling for a global response.

          <p>An analysis examines why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in bilateral trade deals under the Trump administration. These high-value, high-profile purchases serve as visible symbols of cooperation and help partner countries demonstrate a commitment to reducing their trade surpluses with the U.S. Unlike agricultural or steel imports, aircraft orders are less politically sensitive for domestic industries in countries like Japan or South Korea. Furthermore, the long production backlogs for planes mean that these multi-billion dollar announcements can be made without immediate financial strain, serving both pragmatic and performative purposes.</p>

          <p>Recent analysis suggests the Boko Haram insurgency is renewing its offensive in Nigeria, with a significant increase in fatal attacks and abductions in the first half of 2025. Experts attribute this resurgence to several factors, including Niger's withdrawal from a regional joint task force, which has made the border more porous for arms smuggling. Additionally, the Nigerian military's resources are stretched thin by other security crises across the country, leaving communities more vulnerable. Despite military claims of stability, residents report ongoing fear and tension, and analysts see no immediate end to the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>France's government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, was ousted after losing a no-confidence vote in parliament, deepening the country's political crisis. The collapse was triggered by a deadlock over the 2026 budget, as Bayrou's centrist minority government failed to secure support for proposed spending cuts aimed at reducing the nation's large deficit. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a new prime minister, the fifth in under two years, or risk calling another snap election.

Proposed by a commission convened by Mayor Eric Adams, the initiatives aim to streamline the development of affordable housing by working around the city council's discretionary power, known as "member deference," which often kills projects. The council claims the measures could confuse voters, but critics argue it is an anti-democratic move to preserve their power over local development.

          <p>A public inquiry into the deadly Southport attack heard harrowing testimony about a young girl who was stabbed six times as she protected her younger sister from the assailant, Axel Rudakubana. Both sisters survived the July 2024 attack on a dance workshop, which killed three other children. Their mother told the inquiry that the girls' father found the severely wounded older child covered in blood and fainted from shock. The inquiry's first phase is examining the killer's history and potential missed opportunities by agencies to prevent the tragedy, as families of survivors call for accountability.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced he is more than doubling the deployment of troops to the country's borders, sending 25,000 soldiers amid an escalating standoff with the Trump administration. The move follows increased U.S. military maneuvering in the Caribbean and a raised bounty for Maduro's capture over accusations of drug trafficking. In a separate, defiant gesture aimed at bringing "joy" to the populace, Maduro also decreed that Venezuela's Christmas season would begin early on October 1. The military deployment is focused on securing oil infrastructure and border regions to defend national sovereignty against perceived U.S. threats.</p>

          <p>French authorities have launched an investigation after pig heads were found outside at least nine mosques in Paris and its suburbs. The city's police chief, Laurent Nunez, condemned the incidents as "despicable acts" and stated that every effort is being made to apprehend the perpetrators. The discoveries have been denounced by Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and Muslim community leaders as outrageous and Islamophobic. The rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris described the acts as a sad new stage in the rise of anti-Muslim hatred in France, which is home to the largest Muslim community in the European Union.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie, facing questions from a parliamentary committee, asserted that "no-one is irreplaceable" in the wake of several high-profile scandals involving the corporation's talent.

Shah affirmed his determination to "stamp out" bad behavior, stating that abuse of power will not be tolerated regardless of an individual's fame or status. Davie acknowledged that culture change takes time and more issues may surface, but he stressed that clear consequences, including dismissal, will be enforced for those who do not uphold the BBC's values.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Gamze Kubasık, whose father was murdered by the German neo-Nazi group NSU in 2006, reflects on her family's decades-long struggle. She describes the immense pain of their loss, compounded by years of wrongful suspicion from police, who investigated her family for mafia or drug connections instead of pursuing a racist motive. Kubasık explains how this institutional failure and societal prejudice isolated her family until the NSU's existence was revealed in 2011. Now, she works to educate young people about the terror group's crimes to ensure the victims are not forgotten and to combat the rising tide of right-wing extremism in Germany.</p>

They join former Commons leader Lucy Powell and left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the contest to replace Angela Rayner. Candidates have a tight deadline to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs to proceed. Phillipson is positioning herself as a unifier who can defeat Reform UK, while Thornberry has signaled she would be a critical voice, urging the government to listen more to the party's membership on issues like welfare and Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Novel 'Pan' by Michael Clune Explores the Metaphysical Experience of Panic Attacks</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michael Clune's new novel, "Pan," offers a vivid and unconventional portrayal of an adolescent besieged by panic attacks. The book review highlights how Clune eschews a standard medical recovery narrative, instead delving into the protagonist's subjective and often surreal experience of anxiety. The narrator, Nicholas, perceives his panic not just as a mental illness but as a form of profound, terrifying insight, possibly connected to the mischievous Greek god Pan. Through a mix of 1990s suburban realism and philosophical inquiry, the novel transforms the harrowing nature of panic into a quest for transcendent meaning, using sharp, high-resolution prose to capture its disorienting effects.</p>

At the ceremony, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed emphasized the dam is a source of prosperity and electricity for the region and insisted it poses no threat to downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan. The $5 billion project, funded almost entirely by Ethiopia, is central to the nation's economic development, aiming to address widespread electricity shortages.

          <p>Construction work in downtown Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, unearthed a 500-pound unexploded bomb from World War II, leading to significant evacuations on Tuesday. The emergency measures affected several city blocks and required the temporary closure of a major bridge over the Danube River, disrupting traffic during the morning rush hour. Bomb disposal experts were called to the scene to defuse the device. The area was the site of an oil refinery that was heavily targeted by Allied bombing raids in 1944, and unexploded ordnance is periodically discovered during construction projects.</p>

          <p>Economists anticipate that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will issue a significant downward revision to its jobs data, potentially showing that hiring was weaker than previously reported by hundreds of thousands of jobs. The preliminary benchmark revision, covering the 12 months through March 2025, aims to more accurately account for business openings and closures. This revision could indicate that the labor market slowdown began earlier than recent monthly reports suggest, providing more context to the stalling job growth observed over the summer. The updated figures are closely watched as they may influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
