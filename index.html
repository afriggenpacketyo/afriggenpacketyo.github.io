          <h2>David Lammy Condemns Israel for Denying Entry to Labour MPs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 02:38:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has voiced strong disapproval of Israeli authorities for denying entry to Labour MPs Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, who intended to visit the country. Lammy described the action as unacceptable and counterproductive, emphasizing that it is not the way to treat British Parliamentarians. Israeli authorities justified their decision by claiming the MPs intended to spread hate speech against Israel, a claim Lammy disputes. The Foreign Office is providing support to the affected MPs. </p>

          <p>Manchester United is evaluating the future of forward Alejandro Garnacho after a dip in performance levels and a frustrating showing against Nottingham Forest. Despite a promising start to the season, Garnacho's form has declined, leading to fan discussions about whether the club should sell him. Head coach Ruben Amorim had previously dropped Garnacho due to issues with his reaction to instructions, though the matter was resolved quickly. Since then, Garnacho has struggled to replicate his earlier success, scoring only one goal in 21 appearances. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Will Hutton argues that Britain should not be cowed by Trump's trade policies but instead seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond. He criticizes Trump's view of trade as a zero-sum game and advocates for Britain to combine with other nations to sustain a rules-based global trading system. Hutton suggests associating Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU and extending this association to a newly relevant Commonwealth. He believes this approach would create a fresh system that benefits Britain, the world, and the US if it chooses to participate. </p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan before a recent drill, likely as training to counter American warships and explore alternative routes in case of conflict. The Shandong bypassed wider waterways, transiting via narrower passages of the Philippine archipelago. Analysts suggest this new route offers the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel. The Shandong conducted joint maneuvers with naval and aerial units southeast of Taiwan, including a Type 055 destroyer and other warships. </p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. The IDF initially claimed the medics approached suspiciously in darkness without lights, but video footage shows the vehicles were marked and had lights on. While the IDF insists some medics were linked to Hamas, they admit the team was unarmed. The IDF has promised a thorough examination of the incident, while international organizations are calling for an independent investigation. </p>

          <p>Mark Cuban has cautioned that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, coupled with cuts led by the White House DOGE office, could lead to a severe economic crisis. Cuban suggests that the combination of these policies could create a situation worse than the 2008 financial crisis. He emphasizes the potential for long-term economic harm if the tariffs remain in place and are inflationary, alongside continued cuts to the federal workforce. The 2008 crisis saw significant declines in GDP and a surge in unemployment.
