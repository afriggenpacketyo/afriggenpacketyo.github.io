          <p>The UEFA Europa League is reportedly considering a vote to suspend Israel over the conflict in Gaza, potentially barring Israeli teams from international competitions, including the World Cup. An Israel Football Federation spokesperson stated they have no indication of facing such a vote and are focused on upcoming matches. The U.S. State Department intends to block any efforts to ban Israel's team from the World Cup. Last year, the Palestinian Football Association proposed sanctions against Israel, leading FIFA to launch an independent investigation into alleged discrimination. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and political implications within international soccer. Optimism for this situation is low.</p>

          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue exceeding analyst estimates, driven by double-digit growth in membership income and e-commerce sales. The company's net income rose to $2.61 billion, with revenue increasing from $79.7 billion year-over-year. Same-store sales increased by 6.4%, excluding gas price and foreign exchange impacts, marking two consecutive quarters of deceleration. Costco has attracted younger members with convenient online shopping, a wider variety of merchandise, and cheaper meals. The retailer has also taken measures to reduce tariff-related costs, including rushing orders and rerouting imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order approving a proposal to keep TikTok alive in the U.S. by placing it under the control of American investors. The deal, which still requires Chinese approval, involves a new joint-venture company overseeing TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund will be main investors, controlling a roughly 45% stake. Trump stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal, ensuring American operation of TikTok.

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million of federal grants for animal testing as major federal health agencies phase out research on live animals. Pressure for change comes from animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress. Animal tests have played a crucial role in developing vaccines and medications. Federal agencies have promised to phase out animal research, but watchdogs have found recent examples of new animal research. This is a step in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Health-care providers could lose more than $32 billion in revenue if the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits expire this year. The lapse in Obamacare subsidies could lead to an additional $7.7 billion in unpaid medical bills from uninsured patients. Average premiums could rise by about 75% for millions of Americans if the subsidies go away. Republicans have said they are open to discussing extending the subsidies but do not want to include such negotiations in government funding talks. (not investment advice)</p>

The agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments. This is a smart move for the SSA.</p>
