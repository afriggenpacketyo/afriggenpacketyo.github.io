        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imported goods illegal, citing that he overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The ruling halts tariffs assessed on virtually every other country and raises questions about the future of Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs to bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs and generate federal revenue. While the administration plans to appeal, the decision provides potential relief to U.S. businesses and consumers who bear the cost of these tariffs, though some tariffs remain in place under other trade rules. Uncertainty remains as the ruling's impact unfolds and the Trump administration considers alternative routes to impose tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economic tensions between the US and China are intensifying, shifting from tariffs to advanced technology, following Washington's moves to potentially pause exports of semiconductor design and jet-engine manufacturing technologies to China. The US Department of Commerce has reportedly instructed American electronic design automation firms to cease supplying their technology to China, while some licenses allowing American companies to sell products and technology to China's state-owned aerospace manufacturer, Comac, have been suspended. This escalation poses a threat to the "Geneva ceasefire," a temporary pause in the tariff war achieved during recent high-stakes bilateral talks, according to analysts. The decoupling of US-China tech sectors is expected to be prolonged and increasingly complex, irrespective of tariff negotiations.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's announcement of plans to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students, applicants in Beijing are expressing anxiety and uncertainty. While hundreds of thousands of Chinese students pursue education in the U.S., many now fear the potential impact of the new policy, which targets those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has condemned the move as discriminatory, stating it harms the lawful rights of Chinese students and undermines America's image of freedom and openness. Experts suggest China may retaliate in unrelated areas or view the measures as self-defeating, potentially leading more students to choose alternative destinations for their education.</p>

The company's first-quarter earnings report highlights the disruptive impact of evolving trade policies on U.S. businesses with global supply chains. Best Buy is adapting to the tariffs by encouraging vendors to diversify manufacturing locations and negotiating lower costs, while also focusing on improving customer experience and driving efficiency.</p>

          <p>A Fox News newsletter titled "Antisemitism Exposed" focuses on rising anti-Jewish prejudice, highlighting the Trump administration's conflict with Harvard University. The newsletter details the administration's decision to claw back Harvard's remaining federal funding due to concerns about the school's tolerance of antisemitism. It also covers the suspension of a Twitch streamer for broadcasting the manifesto of a suspect in the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers and includes commentary from Israeli Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, condemning UN officials for allegedly spreading false claims related to the murders. The newsletter also features First Lady Melania Trump's dismissal of claims that her husband's feud with Harvard is about something other than the school's tolerance of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>High school sports coverage, a popular local program on PBS stations, is at risk due to potential federal funding cuts. PBS stations in states without professional sports have expanded their high school sports programming, leading to increased viewership and donor support. However, President Trump's executive order to cut federal funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, alleging biased news coverage, threatens this programming.

Answering the question of whether you are trying to maximize the amount of cash that you're earning or if it is a per purchase choice can help guide you on whether a short-term CD or a long-term CD would be a better option for your particular situation. A CD ladder strategy, using CDs with varying maturity dates, can also be beneficial in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. court ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal means to maintain its trade policy. Goldman Sachs economists suggest options such as Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. These measures could allow the administration to reimpose tariffs, although they may require formal investigations or congressional action. The swift appeal by the Trump administration indicates the importance of this issue and the potential for the Supreme Court to ultimately decide the matter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on immigration applications, offering relief to immigrants from various countries whose legal status was threatened. The ruling supports pro-immigrant advocates who argued that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law. The programs affected rely on legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. The order prevents those who entered the U.S. under those policies from obtaining other forms of legal status, like asylum, Temporary Protected Status or permanent residency.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling that struck down President Trump's tariffs is being viewed as a vindication of the rule of law, rather than judicial overreach. The court determined that neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes Trump to impose the tariffs he ordered, affirming Congress's power over trade. This decision is supported by the Constitution's delegation of tariff power to Congress and the fact that states, acting as checks on federal power, requested the ruling. The Court of International Trade's role is to exercise authority over trade disputes, making this ruling central to its purview.</p>

For the first year, the index included health as a category due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While no U.S. cities ranked in the top 10, New York City and Minneapolis received the "gold city" distinction, ranking at No. 17 and No. 30, respectively. The United States had 18 cities ranked, making up almost 10% of the entire index, which Dr. Bartoszewicz calls a good result.</p>
