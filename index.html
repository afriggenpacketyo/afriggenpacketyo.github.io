          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado resulted in two students being critically wounded by gunfire, with the juvenile male suspect also hospitalized with injuries. The incident occurred just before 12:30 p.m., prompting a massive law enforcement response and a school lockdown. Deputies were on the scene within two minutes and made contact with the shooter quickly, and no officers fired their weapons. The event caused chaos as students fled, leading to a difficult reunification process for parents and highlighting the ongoing challenge of preparing for such emergencies in schools.</p>

          <p>Conservative youth activist Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University. The governor has labeled the incident a "political assassination," and a person of interest is reportedly in custody. The attack, which involved a single shot from a distance, has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from President Trump and former President Biden. The event has shocked the nation, prompting calls to reject political violence and leading to the closure of the university campus as the FBI assists in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>A long-standing perk for California drivers of clean air vehicles is ending, as the federal program allowing solo drivers in carpool lanes was not extended. Starting October 1, the half-million vehicles with active Clean Air Vehicle decals will no longer have this privilege, a change that Governor Newsom blamed on congressional Republicans. The program, which began over two decades ago, was designed as an incentive to encourage the adoption of zero-emission vehicles. While the state had passed a bill to extend the program, it cannot continue without federal authorization, a move critics say will increase traffic and smog.</p>

It details his founding of Turning Point USA at age 18 and his role in building the young MAGA movement, creating a counterweight to liberal dominance on college campuses. The piece also notes the controversies surrounding his platform, including the promotion of far-right personalities and falsehoods, while highlighting his crucial role in the Trump campaign's ground-level organizing.

          <p>Following a successful Initial Public Offering where its stock climbed on the first day, financial commentator Jim Cramer suggested that Swedish online lender Klarna remains a worthwhile investment. The "buy now, pay later" company saw its shares rise 14.55% after pricing its IPO above the expected range, reaching a valuation over $17 billion. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and impressive automated underwriting standards as positive signs.

          <p>State lawmakers have introduced legislation to reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," in an effort to encourage housing construction. The bill, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass's office, would significantly reduce the property transfer tax for newly constructed apartment buildings and commercial properties. Critics of Measure ULA have argued that, while intended to fund homelessness programs, it has had a chilling effect on new development. The proposed changes are also part of a political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA and other local taxes entirely.</p>

Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the competitive gap has narrowed and warned of the danger of losing pre-eminence. He advocated for exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks"—which integrate chips, algorithms, and applications—to allies as a strategy to prevent China from gaining global market share.

The 23-year-old plaintiff claims that after she vomited in the vehicle, the driver left her near a Sacramento gas station, miles from her destination and without her phone or keys. She was then reportedly approached by two individuals who offered help but instead took her to an apartment where she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint.

MPs also questioned the program's value, as it is forecast to cost taxpayers £3 billion over five years, with research suggesting most users could have bought a home without it.

          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. The key may lie in what is known as "dark DNA," the vast non-gene portions of the genetic code whose function is largely a mystery. Scientists theorize that this dark DNA, which is three times more abundant in these spiders than in humans, could enable rapid adaptation and speciation. By decoding the genetics behind the spiders' varied colors, songs, and mating dances, the research aims to shed light on the broader processes that generate biodiversity in the natural world.</p>

          <p>Top security analysts are expressing concern over the strengthening ties between China, Russia, North Korea, and India, viewing it as the potential formation of an "anti-Western alliance." Recent high-profile meetings, including a military parade in Beijing attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, are seen as evidence of a strategic shift. Experts suggest Beijing is actively pursuing a new world order based on military strength and repressive regimes, representing a "psychological decoupling" from the West. While not a formal military pact like NATO, this adaptable network is seen as a significant challenge to the current global order.</p>

Proponents argued that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military actions without contemporary congressional approval.

It connects the incident to a political environment of intense polarization, calcification, and existential stakes, where individuals feel powerless and resort to violence.

          <p>In a move reflecting heightened security concerns, NASA has restricted access for Chinese citizens to its facilities, materials, and networks. The new policy affects Chinese nationals on U.S. visas who previously could contribute to agency work as contractors, students, or university scientists, provided they had no ties to Chinese state institutions. A NASA spokeswoman confirmed the "internal action" was taken to ensure the security of the agency's work. This decision comes as both the U.S. and China are actively pursuing crewed missions to the moon, intensifying the competition in space exploration between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison momentarily surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's wealthiest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison's net worth surged to $393 billion after Oracle's stock soared over 40% due to a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. The company reported a significant increase in demand from AI companies for its data centers. Although Musk reclaimed the top spot by the end of the trading day as Oracle's shares settled, the event highlights the massive wealth being generated by the AI boom.</p>

          <p>This article examines the deployment of 2,200 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., by President Trump, following an assault on a tech executive. The discussion, featuring Georgetown law professor Rosa Brooks, explores the constitutional limits of militarized policing and the potential for such actions to set dangerous precedents. The piece questions the effectiveness of "flooding the zone" in tourist-heavy areas while neglecting high-crime neighborhoods and raises concerns about the use of unidentified federal agents. Critics worry that normalizing military presence in cities could be used to intimidate voters or suppress dissent in future elections.</p>

          <h2>U.S.-Bound Freight Shipments Slow Significantly, Defying Peak Holiday Season Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 16:42:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to typical seasonal trends, freight trade to the United States has slowed to a crawl during what is normally the peak period for holiday shipments. Imports from China have dropped sharply, and logistics experts see no signs of the usual late-September rush ahead of China's Golden Week holiday. This slowdown is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted retailers to front-load inventory earlier in the year, and now increasing inventory levels in the U.S. are causing a pause in new orders. As a result, ocean carriers are announcing blank sailings, signaling a pessimistic trade outlook for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant escalation occurred as at least 19 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, prompting a military response from Polish and other NATO jets. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described the event as the closest the region has been to open conflict since World War II. While Russia issued a non-denial denial, NATO leaders condemned the act as a reckless provocation and a test of the alliance's resolve. The incident has triggered an emergency meeting under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, underscoring the gravity of the threat to the alliance's territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour has finally offered her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada." The movie's demanding boss, Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, was widely seen as being based on Wintour. Speaking on a podcast, Wintour called the film a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Streep's fantastic performance. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, uncertain of what to expect, but was ultimately not offended by the portrayal. Her comments come as a sequel to the film is reportedly in production.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha has raised questions about potential military escalation and the future of Qatari-led ceasefire negotiations. While Qatar condemned the attack, analysts believe a direct military response is unlikely due to its strategic alliance with the U.S., which maintains a major military base there. The incident has, however, prompted Qatar's emir to state he is "reassessing everything" regarding his country's mediation role, expressing frustration with the process. The strike underscores the delicate balance Qatar maintains in hosting Hamas's political office while serving as a key negotiator for Western interests.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under political pressure regarding Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the U.S., following new revelations about his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Recently released documents included a letter where Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal." While Mandelson has expressed deep regret for the association, which he says he maintained for too long based on false assurances, opposition parties and some Labour MPs are calling for his dismissal. The Prime Minister has so far stood by his appointee, stating that full due process was followed before his appointment.</p>
