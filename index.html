          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has announced a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the long-term effects of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This initiative marks the first large-scale effort to provide restitution for the atrocity that devastated the Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. The plan involves raising private funds to support housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives within the affected community. This move seeks to rectify historical injustices and promote healing and economic empowerment for the descendants of the victims. The program hopes to create a more equitable and just future for Tulsa's Black community, who continue to face the repercussions of this historical event.</p>

          <p>Over 50 people were killed and many more wounded near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, though Israel denies its soldiers were involved. Witnesses reported gunfire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claimed it delivered aid without incident and dismissed reports of chaos. U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the GHF system, citing violations of humanitarian principles and Israeli control over aid distribution, and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have faltered, with each side blaming the other. The incident occurred amidst warnings of potential famine in Gaza due to restricted aid and widespread looting.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released the list of names for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which begins on Sunday. Forecasters predict a 60% chance of an above-normal season, with 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes expected. The names, set by the World Meteorological Organization, are rotated every six years, and retired if a storm is particularly deadly or costly. This year's list includes names such as Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and Dexter, among others, which will be used to help meteorologists and the public easily track and discuss specific storms.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that while he has been a strong ally of President Trump, he doesn't want to be held responsible for all of the administration's policies, as his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) concludes. Musk acknowledged the challenges of his role, where DOGE became a target for blame regarding government cuts. He also expressed disappointment with the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, which he believes undermines DOGE's efforts. Despite his support for Trump, Musk's comments highlight potential disagreements with certain policies.</p>

          <p>A California family is suing Forest Lawn Cemetery after discovering their mother was buried in the wrong plot for four years. The Demirchyan family made the discovery while burying their father, when a mortician revealed that their mother's headstone did not match her actual burial site. The family is seeking damages for emotional distress and aims to prevent similar mistakes from happening to other families. Despite the cemetery correcting the error, the family feels the emotional pain caused by mourning at the wrong location cannot be easily dismissed.</p>
