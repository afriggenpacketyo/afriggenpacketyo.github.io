        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has launched standard range versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, with the Model Y priced just under $40,000. The announcement follows online speculation but disappointed some investors who hoped for updates on other long-promised products like the next-generation Roadster. The move comes as Tesla faces a multi-quarter sales slump due to an aging vehicle lineup, increased competition, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's public rhetoric. The company is attempting to pivot investor focus towards its robotics and self-driving car initiatives amid these challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial planner advises that when choosing between traditional and Roth 401(k) contributions, savers should consider their effective tax rate rather than their marginal tax rate. While many decide based on whether their tax bracket will be higher or lower in retirement, the effective rate—total tax paid as a percentage of total income—is often much lower than the marginal rate. This calculation could indicate that pretax contributions are more advantageous if one's effective tax rate in retirement is expected to be significantly lower. Experts emphasize a multiyear perspective, aiming to pay taxes when rates are lowest. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the monthly cost of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable compared to previous months and the prior year. A $25,000 HELOC with a 10-year term now costs around $302 per month, down from about $313 a year ago, presenting a cheaper borrowing alternative to high-interest credit cards. The article notes that HELOC rates are variable and can fluctuate, so homeowners should budget for potential changes. It also explains the option of making interest-only payments during the initial draw period to further lower monthly costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The National Hurricane Center predicts it could intensify into a major Category 3 hurricane before weakening is expected to begin on Wednesday. While the storm's center is forecast to remain offshore, its outer bands are already affecting Baja California Sur, prompting a tropical storm watch and warnings of heavy rain, flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions. Moisture from the storm is also expected to bring a risk of heavy rainfall to the U.S. Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva held what Trump described as a "very good" phone call, signaling a potential thaw in their contentious relationship. The conversation follows a period of friction marked by U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports and Trump's strong condemnation of the prosecution and imprisonment of his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump had previously characterized Bolsonaro's trial as a "witch hunt" and an "international disgrace."

          <p>A week into the government shutdown, an increase in air traffic controllers calling in sick is causing significant flight delays and cancellations across the United States. Controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, leading to staffing shortages at key facilities like Burbank Airport, which had to close its tower. The FAA is slowing traffic to ensure safety, while the controller's union highlights the fragility of the system amid a national shortage of these professionals. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed concern over the financial stress placed on controllers, who face missing paychecks if the shutdown continues.</p>

          <p>The arrival of Texas National Guard members in a Chicago suburb has escalated a conflict between state and federal authorities. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have condemned the deployment as an "authoritarian march" and filed a lawsuit to block it, arguing it is an illegal militarization of cities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott confirmed he authorized the deployment at President Trump's request to ensure the safety of federal officials. The move is seen by Illinois leaders as a political maneuver by the Trump administration to create chaos and a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act.</p>

          <p>During a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump characterized the relationship between the U.S. and Canada as one of "natural conflict" alongside "mutual love." The meeting addressed ongoing trade tensions, steep U.S. tariffs, and the upcoming review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump indicated a willingness to either renegotiate the USMCA or pursue "different deals," while Carney emphasized that there are more areas of cooperation than competition. The visit occurs amid what some experts call the worst period in U.S.-Canada relations, fractured by Trump's trade policies.</p>

The loan is repaid when the owner sells the home, moves out, or passes away.

The plaintiff, a therapist, argues the law violates her First Amendment free speech rights by censoring conversations about changing a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity. Colorado defends the law as a regulation of professional conduct, necessary to protect minors from a practice widely deemed harmful by major medical and mental health organizations. The justices' questions explored the line between protected speech and professional malpractice, with some conservative justices appearing skeptical of relying on the consensus of medical experts.</p>

In a statement, Kneecap condemned the appeal as "political policing" and a "massive waste of taxpayers money," framing it as part of a "state wide witch-hunt against Palestinian solidarity."</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings undrafted rookie Myles Price is making an impression five games into his NFL career as the team's primary kick and punt returner. Price, who excelled in college but never scored a return touchdown, says he feels he is on the verge of breaking a long return every time he touches the ball. He describes his preparation process, which involves studying opposing punters and focusing on fundamentals like tracking the ball in the air and securing the catch. As a receiver low on the depth chart, his performance on special teams is his primary way to contribute to the team.</p>

          <p>The record-breaking price of gold, which recently surpassed $4,000 an ounce, is creating significant challenges for the jewelry industry. Mid-market companies that aim to offer affordable fine jewelry are feeling pressure, with some like Mejuri announcing price increases and others like Pandora exploring alternative manufacturing methods. The surge in gold's value is driven by investor demand amid global economic uncertainty and central bank purchasing. This forces jewelers to innovate with products like 10-karat gold or gold-plated items to maintain accessible price points for consumers who may not absorb the full cost increase.

          <p>A new geological study proposes that a massive earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone, located off the Pacific Northwest coast, could trigger a subsequent large earthquake on the northern San Andreas fault in California. Researchers analyzed ancient submarine landslide deposits and found evidence suggesting this back-to-back disaster scenario may have occurred multiple times over thousands of years, including after the great Cascadia quake of 1700. The findings imply that emergency planners may need to prepare for the possibility of two catastrophic seismic events occurring in close succession, which would severely strain national response resources.</p>

          <p>The world's leading rugby nations, including England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, have collectively announced that they will not select players who participate in the proposed breakaway R360 league. This move effectively forces players to choose between their international careers and the lucrative contracts offered by the new globe-trotting competition. The unions' joint statement expressed concerns that R360 could fragment the sport and weaken investment in community rugby, while also raising questions about player welfare and calendar conflicts. The decision is a significant blow to R360's plans, which had hoped players could do both.</p>

With infrastructure decimated and access to aid severely limited, the population faces widespread hunger, with the U.N. reporting famine conditions in parts of the strip.

          <p>Orlando Bravo, co-founder of private equity firm Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing parallels to the dot-com era. He cautioned that it is unsustainable to value a company with $50 million in annual recurring revenue at $10 billion, noting the immense pressure this places on management to generate massive cash flow. However, Bravo highlighted a key difference from the dot-com collapse: today's AI boom is being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets, which provides a different financial foundation than the speculative venture capital of the late 1990s.

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of denying back pay to some furloughed federal workers, a move that appears to contradict a 2019 law guaranteeing such compensation. A draft White House memo argues that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act requires new congressional action to appropriate funds for back pay, an interpretation disputed by Democrats and federal employee unions. President Trump stated that whether workers get paid "depends on who we're talking about," suggesting some may not "deserve to be taken care of." The move is seen as a pressure tactic to force Democrats to agree to a funding bill without their desired policy additions.</p>

The group, which remains anonymous, has successfully mobilized some of the largest anti-government demonstrations in the country's recent history, calling for the prime minister's resignation and reforms in education and healthcare. Organizers say they use Discord for its security, anonymity, and ability to facilitate democratic decision-making through online votes. This digital-native approach allows the movement to operate without a formal hierarchy, though it also presents challenges for engaging in direct dialogue with the government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced plans to significantly increase tariffs on imported steel, a move that UK steel industry leaders are calling a potential "disaster." The proposal would cut the amount of tariff-free steel that can be imported into the EU by nearly half, applying a 50% tariff on anything beyond that quota. As the EU is the UK's largest export market for steel, worth nearly £3 billion annually, the new measures could be devastating for an already struggling industry. The EU's action is partly a response to global overcapacity and pressure from member states to protect their own steelmakers from cheap imports.</p>
