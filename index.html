          <p>Google has appointed Koray Kavukcuoglu, previously Google DeepMind's CTO, as its new chief AI architect, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai. Kavukcuoglu will be responsible for accelerating the integration of Google's AI models into its products, aiming for seamless integration, faster iteration, and greater efficiency. This move comes as Google faces increasing pressure to monetize its AI technology, particularly from the DeepMind unit, amid intense competition from other tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Google plans to invest $75 billion in AI infrastructure this year while also cutting costs in other areas, such as offering buyouts to employees in Search and Ads. The company recently unveiled new AI products at its annual I/O conference, including a subscription plan with early access to AI tools and partnerships for its Android XR operating system. </p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his New York retrial, while the jury acquitted him on a separate count involving Kaja Sokola and remained deadlocked on a rape charge related to Jessica Mann. The split verdict followed days of tense deliberations, with the jury indicating internal discord and apparent threats. Weinstein, who did not testify, has maintained that all encounters were consensual, while prosecutors argued he used his power to sexually abuse young women. The trial involved accusations from Haley, Mann, and Sokola, with the defense portraying the encounters as consensual relationships in exchange for work opportunities, a claim Ms. Haley found insulting. The verdict provides hope to Haley that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading. The 73-year-old still faces a 16-year sentence for sex crimes in California, meaning he was already expected to spend the rest of his life in prison regardless of the retrial's outcome. </p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, primarily due to unexpected maintenance costs and hidden fees. The survey reveals that homeowners spend an average of over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, with costs reaching around $29,000 in states like Hawaii and California. Experts recommend thorough home inspections to identify potential defects and budgeting for ongoing maintenance to avoid costly surprises.

          <p>A second-grade class is rallying to support the African Meeting House in Boston after the museum faced significant federal grant cuts of $500,000. The African Meeting House, built in 1806, is the oldest Black church in America and a vital historical site, having served as a gathering place for the 54th Regiment during the Civil War and a platform for leaders like Frederick Douglass. The funding cut jeopardizes staffing positions and programs, but the Advent School's second-grade class, inspired by a field trip to the Meeting House, is raising awareness and funds through letter-writing and advocacy at the State House. The museum has already raised $100,000 in community donations, with the curator expressing gratitude for the students' efforts in preserving the legacy of the space for future generations. The students' activism demonstrates the enduring impact of the Meeting House and the importance of preserving its history.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urging countries to avoid participating in a UN conference focused on a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, according to a U.S. cable. The administration views the conference as counterproductive to efforts to end the war in Gaza and free hostages, threatening diplomatic consequences for countries taking "anti-Israel actions" following the event. This stance conflicts with the diplomacy of France and Saudi Arabia, who are co-hosting the conference aimed at establishing a roadmap for a Palestinian state while ensuring Israel's security. The U.S. opposes unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, arguing it would hinder conflict resolution and potentially coerce Israel, emboldening its enemies, with the ambassador to Israel suggesting an independent Palestinian state is no longer a U.S. foreign policy goal.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, decided to testify again in his New York retrial to stand up for herself and the truth after a previous conviction was overturned. Haley testified about the sexual assault she endured in 2006, recounting the details of the incident in Weinstein's apartment. She spent four days on the stand, facing cross-examination from Weinstein's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, who questioned her about the events of that night. Haley felt the cross-examination was offensive and disrespectful, but she remained determined to share her story and seek justice. Her testimony contributed to Weinstein being found guilty of sexually assaulting her, although he was acquitted on another charge, providing hope for a new awareness around sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering whether to further curb the president’s favorite tax cuts as they rewrite key portions of the sprawling domestic agenda bill passed by the House. This action comes amid concerns about the bill's budgetary impact and the need to balance competing priorities. The senators are seeking to refine the tax cuts to ensure fiscal responsibility and address potential economic consequences. This may involve adjusting the scope or duration of certain tax cuts to align with broader economic goals.</p>

          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and to diversify their holdings. Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s, with China, India, and Turkey being major buyers. The ECB said survey data had found gold was increasingly attractive to emerging and developing countries that were concerned about sanctions and the potential erosion of the role of major currencies in the international monetary system. However, there are signs that central bank purchases may cool in the months ahead, according to analysts, with the rate of central bank gold purchases falling 33% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year.

          <p>An uneasy calm has settled over Los Angeles following protests sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration raids, resulting in nearly 400 arrests. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass attributed the unrest to the "fear" and "panic" caused by the raids, suggesting the city was part of a national experiment to undermine local government. The deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines aims to quell the unrest, with authorities making "mass arrests" after a fifth day of protests. The military deployment to the LA area will cost $134m (£99m), the Pentagon said. Despite the calm, tensions remain high as the president vows to "liberate" the city, while California Governor Gavin Newsom accuses Trump of an "assault" on democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is proposing major rollbacks to power plant pollution limits, allowing increased emissions of unhealthy air toxins and planet-heating gases. The EPA's plan would repeal a climate rule aimed at eliminating greenhouse gases from power plants by the 2030s and weaken regulations on hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Administrator Lee Zeldin claims the rollbacks will save households money and defy what he calls "the climate change cult", despite scientific evidence of the dire consequences of climate change and the harm caused by pollutants. Health experts warn the moves would lead to the biggest pollution increases in decades, contradicting the EPA's mission to protect public health and the environment.</p>

Legal experts widely view such a move as a violation of Posse Comitatus, which prohibits using troops for law enforcement purposes.

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025, with registrations surging by 20% from January to April, driven primarily by corporate sales and EU regulations. While public enthusiasm for EVs remains stagnant, a mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions has spurred corporate buyers to accelerate fleet electrification. However, challenges remain, including consumer skepticism about EVs, the need for expanded charging infrastructure, and increased competition from Chinese brands. Tesla's sales have plummeted, partly due to backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political involvement, while Chinese automakers are gaining ground thanks to heavy state subsidies, underscoring the fast-changing dynamics of the European auto market.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk expressed regret for some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, stating that they "went too far." The conflict between Musk and Trump arose from Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill. Musk's opposition to the bill sparked a public dispute with Trump, dissolving a tight partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency, fueling market concerns over the outlook for Tesla and SpaceX. Despite the initial fallout, Musk has now softened his stance, indicating a potential reconciliation with the president.</p>
