          <p>President Trump, alongside state and federal officials, toured a new temporary immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The center, built in eight days at a remote airport, is intended to house, process, and deport undocumented immigrants, with officials highlighting its isolated and unforgiving terrain as a deterrent. While the administration touts the facility as a professional model for other states, critics and protesters have condemned it as a "callous political stunt," and environmental groups have filed a lawsuit to block its opening pending an environmental review.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a significant domestic policy package favored by President Trump with a 51-50 vote, requiring a tie-breaker from Vice President JD Vance.

          <p>As home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) become a more attractive borrowing option due to falling interest rates, homeowners are advised to avoid several key mistakes. The article warns against failing to monitor the fluctuating rate climate, assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions, and overborrowing due to rates being lower than alternatives like personal loans. It also cautions against using home equity for non-strategic, short-term expenses like vacations, instead suggesting it be used for value-adding home renovations or as an emergency fund.

          <p>Shares of defense contractor AeroVironment dropped by 8% after the company announced plans for a significant capital raise to manage its debt. The drone manufacturer intends to offer $750 million in common stock and $600 million in convertible senior notes. The primary use of the proceeds will be to repay existing debt, with any remaining funds allocated for general corporate purposes, such as increasing manufacturing capacity. This stock dilution comes after a period of strong performance, with the company's shares having soared 85% this year, partly fueled by its recent acquisition of Blue Halo.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has expanded its use of Guantanamo Bay for immigration detention, now holding individuals from China, Jamaica, Liberia, and the United Kingdom, according to internal records. This marks a significant shift from primarily detaining Latin American nationals at the controversial Cuban base. U.S. officials state that most of the 54 immigration detainees are considered "high-risk" due to criminal records or disruptive behavior. The move underscores a broad crackdown on illegal immigration and has drawn strong criticism from civil rights advocates over the legality of holding immigration detainees outside the U.S.</p>

The new charges detail a scheme starting in 2019 where she allegedly stole from her husband's business accounts, used altered bank documents for loans, and defrauded a friend.

Instead, it recommends actively shopping for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, which tend to offer more competitive yields.

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis concludes that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would financially harm the lowest-earning Americans while benefiting wealthier households. The study found that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9% (about $700), while the top 20% would gain 2.2% ($5,700). This disparity is attributed to sharp cuts in social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which disproportionately affect low-income families, while the bill's tax cut extensions provide a larger net benefit to the rich.

          <p>An Algerian court has sentenced French sports journalist Christophe Gleizes to seven years in prison, a verdict that has drawn condemnation from press freedom advocates. Gleizes was detained 13 months ago while researching an article on the Algerian football club JSK Kabylie. His supporters contend his work was strictly about football and that he is being punished for contacting an exiled opposition figure who was formerly involved with the club. The case highlights strained diplomatic relations between France and Algeria and follows a similar harsh sentence against French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal for allegedly threatening state security.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock fell nearly 5% after President Donald Trump suggested that the federal government should investigate the subsidies received by Elon Musk's companies. In a social media post, Trump claimed that without government support, Musk's ventures like Tesla and SpaceX would fail, and urged his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to review the funding. The comments mark an escalation in a public feud between the two, which was reignited by Musk's harsh criticism of the major tax and spending bill currently moving through Congress. Musk responded by stating he supports cutting all subsidies.</p>

          <p>The family of Jane Wu, a prominent China-born neuroscientist who died by suicide in 2024, has filed a civil complaint against Northwestern University. The lawsuit alleges discrimination and isolation, claiming the university dismantled her research lab, reassigned her grants to white male colleagues, and cut her salary during a years-long federal investigation into her China ties. Although the investigation by the National Institutes of Health concluded without any findings of misconduct against her, the family states that Northwestern never restored her lab or funding, effectively ending her career.</p>

A major emerging threat is the surge in GPS jamming and spoofing near conflict zones, which can interfere with aircraft navigation systems.

Both bills introduce work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, but the Senate version expands these requirements to parents of older children.

While the tournament was financially lucrative, with City earning approximately Â£37.8 million, the early exit means they missed out on significant additional prize money.

While acknowledging potential biases, the study adds to evidence suggesting that what we eat can influence the quality of our sleep and dreams.</p>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the largest monthly drop since February 2023.

Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate stood at 2.1%, though this is the slowest pace in nearly a year.

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare is launching a new system that allows millions of websites to block artificial intelligence bots from scraping their content without permission. The tool targets AI crawlers that collect data to train large language models, often without directing traffic or revenue back to the original creators. This move is seen as a significant step for publishers and content creators who have accused AI firms of using their work unfairly. Cloudflare is also developing a "Pay Per Crawl" system to create a new economic model where AI companies can pay for access.</p>
