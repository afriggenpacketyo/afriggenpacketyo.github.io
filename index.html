          <p>A suspected clerical error on the Deliveroo app led to some Co-op products being priced with up to a 100% discount, allowing some customers to acquire items like pasta sauce, coffee, and cookies for free. The Co-op spokesperson said that the error was quickly resolved, and they apologized for any inconvenience caused. Some shoppers, who learned of the glitch through social media, quickly placed orders before the prices were corrected. One customer in Lancashire secured over Â£80 worth of goods for just Â£3.29 and plans to donate most of the items to a local food bank. There is no suggestion that this was linked to the cyber attack that affected the Co-op's IT systems recently.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will prioritize its national interests during ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States. While acknowledging the talks as positive, Ishiba emphasized the need for both nations to exert maximum effort to bridge existing gaps. Top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa called for a review of President Trump's tariff policy during meetings with U.S. officials. The United States has been hesitant to exempt Japan from higher tariffs on key imports like cars, iron, steel, and aluminum, and further negotiations are scheduled for mid-May. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato suggested Japan could leverage its U.S. Treasury holdings as a negotiating tool.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson has drawn intense scrutiny due to their significant age gap. Relationship expert Jackie Dorman suggests the public's fascination stems from the contrast with Belichick's previous relationships, including his marriage to his childhood sweetheart and a 16-year partnership with someone closer in age. Dorman notes that people are questioning whether Belichick's legacy is being tarnished by this relationship, with some speculating about transactional motives. She highlights the statistical improbability of success for relationships with such a large age difference, while emphasizing the importance of shared life goals and compatibility. Former Patriots star Julian Edelman suggested that Hudson was acting more like a publicist than a girlfriend.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has taken on an unprecedented four government positions, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security advisor. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage these roles, especially under President Trump's unconventional approach to governance. Trump announced Rubio's newest position on social media, surprising even State Department officials. Analysts have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist's role in overseeing record preservation for agencies Rubio also leads. It remains unclear whether Rubio will receive additional compensation or how he will balance his responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, seizing a seat from the Labour Party in Runcorn and Helsby. Sarah Pochin, Reformâ€™s candidate, won by just six votes, signaling a potential shift in British politics towards a more polarized, multiparty system. The victory could bolster Farage's claim that Reform is emerging as a genuine rival to the major parties. The party also performed strongly in mayoral and local council elections across England, potentially winning hundreds of municipal seats. The election results reflect voters' frustration with the economy and tensions over immigration, particularly regarding the housing of migrants in local hotels.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala's theme for the year is "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," which explores how tailoring has shaped Black identities. The exhibition is inspired by Monica L. Miller's book "Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity." The event will be co-chaired by actor Colman Domingo, Formula 1 racer Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, and singer Pharrell Williams. The theme seeks to challenge social and cultural hierarchies through fashion, examining issues of identity, representation, and power. The article also reflects on past Met Gala moments, such as Rihanna's papal-inspired ensemble and Doja Cat's feline transformation, highlighting the event's history of pushing fashion boundaries.</p>

          <p>Secure 2.0 introduces a higher 401(k) catch-up contribution limit for workers aged 60 to 63, increasing it to $11,250 in 2025. This allows eligible investors to defer up to $34,750 into their 401(k). While most retirement plans have adopted this feature, a small percentage have not, potentially limiting catch-up contributions for some workers. Experts like Dan Galli see this as a valuable tool, especially for higher earners seeking a tax deduction. However, only a small fraction of employees actually maximize their 401(k) contributions, indicating that affordability remains a significant barrier for many.</p>

Jenkyns's political career has been marked by both triumphs and controversies, including a resignation from Lincolnshire County Council and a public gesture outside Downing Street.

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesverfassungsschutz (BfV), has classified the entire Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as anti-constitutional. This classification means the AfD is considered opposed to the free democratic basic order and acting in a nationalist, racist, or xenophobic manner. The classification allows authorities to observe AfD meetings, tap telephones, and recruit informants. The party could face a ban, though this would require a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court and a lengthy judicial process. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged restraint and spoke out against any rushed move to ban the AfD.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, although profits declined from the previous year due to falling crude oil prices.

The company's global production business saw a significant increase in earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana. Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases.

          <p>As debates surrounding President Trump's policy agenda intensify, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction are being discussed. The $10,000 limit on the federal deduction, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 without congressional action. Raising the SALT cap has been a priority for lawmakers from high-tax states, and Trump has expressed support for reform. Lawmakers are considering various updates, but a complete repeal is unlikely due to budget constraints. A higher SALT deduction limit could impact higher earners in high-tax states.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners* blends supernatural horror with a depiction of the Jim Crow South, highlighting the economic constraints faced by Black people. The film follows twin gangsters who open a juke joint, but their success is hampered by the segregated economy and the exploitative practices of sharecropping and convict leasing. The film conveys two forms of peonage prominent in the 1930s Southâ€”labor arrangements not far removed from slavery. The twins' struggle to run a profitable business exposes them to supernatural forces, illustrating how systemic oppression can lead to unforeseen dangers. The only unadulterated monsters in the film are the Ku Klux Klan, who show up at the juke joint the next morning to kill the twins and take back the property the Klan leader sold to them, thus pocketing the money.</p>

          <p>California cities are increasingly adopting tiny house shelters and enforcing anti-camping bans to address homelessness. The shift follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce anti-camping bans even when shelter is unavailable. Cities like San Jose and San Francisco are expanding interim housing options and increasing arrests of homeless individuals who refuse shelter. This approach, combining law enforcement with temporary housing, aims to reduce street homelessness. However, critics argue that it may create a two-tiered housing system and divert resources from permanent housing solutions.</p>

Besides concerns about President Trump's tariff policies, they are also losing faith in the U.S. due to fears that capital markets might be weaponized to achieve economic goals. Patterson suggests that these investors are gradually reducing their exposure to U.S. assets, which could have significant consequences.
