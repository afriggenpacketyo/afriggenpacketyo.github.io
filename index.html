          <p>Retail sales in the UK saw a 0.4% increase in March, marking the third consecutive month of growth. Warmer weather positively impacted sales of clothing and DIY goods, while food sales, particularly at supermarkets, remained weak.  A separate survey revealed a decline in consumer confidence to its lowest point since November 2023, driven by rising bills and economic pessimism.</p>
