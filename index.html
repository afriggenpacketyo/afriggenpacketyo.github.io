          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a crucial 6-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, forcing a decisive Game 7. Addison Barger's early single and later two-run home run fueled Toronto's offense, while Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also contributed with a solo home run. Despite opportunities, the Mariners struggled to capitalize, squandering bases-loaded situations. Trey Yesavage's strong pitching performance with seven strikeouts aided the Blue Jays. The final game will determine which team advances to the World Series, a title the Blue Jays haven't held since 1993 and the Mariners have never achieved. </p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 4.8% in the third quarter, meeting analyst forecasts, despite a slump in the real estate sector. Fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted, raising concerns about downward pressure on fourth-quarter GDP growth. Retail sales rose, but slowed compared to August, while industrial production exceeded expectations. China's exports remained resilient, but headline inflation fell, signaling persistent deflationary pressures. (not investment advice) </p>

Participants carried signs and banners, and some events featured marching bands and costumes, creating a street party atmosphere. Organizers claimed the rallies drew more people than previous events, fueled by outrage over immigration policies, attacks on the media, and perceived authoritarian actions. While Republicans criticized the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, participants asserted their love for the country and desire to fight for its values. </p>

While lamps and firecrackers light up homes and streets, they also worsen air pollution, especially in northern India. This year, the Supreme Court permitted the sale and use of "green crackers" in Delhi to curb air pollution. Diwali is about much more than fireworks, with food playing a central role in the celebrations. </p>

Resale platforms are investing heavily in verification to combat increasingly sophisticated counterfeits. Trust is a key factor, as younger shoppers with limited spending power are driving the growth of the secondhand luxury market. (not investment advice) </p>
