          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily reduce the prices of some of its most popular drugs for American consumers. As part of the deal, these medications will be available at significant discounts on a new government-operated website called TrumpRx.gov. In exchange for this and a commitment to invest in U.S. manufacturing, Pfizer's products will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. The company stated this move will help address the disproportionate costs Americans have paid for medical innovation.</p>

          <p>A group of former inmates is volunteering to help renovate Boston's historic Tremont Temple Baptist Church, America's first integrated church. For volunteers like Felipe Colon, who served 21 years in prison, the restoration work has provided a new sense of purpose and a chance to rebuild their lives. The project involves painstaking tasks such as reupholstering and reinstalling balcony chairs that date back to the 1890s. The pastor and volunteers see the church's renovation as a powerful symbol of personal reform and second chances, with the work expected to be completed in October.</p>

They are expected to attend numerous Turning Point events in the coming months to support the group's mission and its new leader, Kirk's widow Erika.

          <p>A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced former president Joseph Kabila to death in absentia for treason and war crimes. The charges against Kabila, who ruled the country for 18 years until 2019, included murder, sexual assault, and insurrection. He was specifically accused by the current president of being the mastermind behind the M23 rebels, a Rwanda-backed militia that has captured significant territory in the country's eastern provinces. Kabila, whose current whereabouts are unknown, has denied the allegations and has been in exile.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that top officials violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. In a detailed decision, U.S. District Judge William Young found that the administration misused its authority to suppress constitutionally protected speech and create a chilling effect on student activism. The judge condemned the actions as a misuse of power intended to terrorize non-citizens into silence for expressing views the administration found unwelcome. He also criticized the use of masked ICE agents as a tactic to intimidate.</p>

          <h2>Potential Government Shutdown Threatens Access to Smithsonian Museums and National Zoo</h2>

          <p>A federal government shutdown would likely lead to the closure of Washington, D.C.'s most prominent cultural institutions, including the 21 Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. Since the Smithsonian relies on the federal government for over 60% of its budget, a lapse in funding would force it to close its doors, although care for the zoo's animals would continue. While outdoor monuments like the Lincoln Memorial are expected to remain physically accessible, tours of federal buildings such as the U.S. Capitol will be suspended. Privately funded institutions, however, will remain open to the public.</p>

          <p>India secured a 59-run victory over Sri Lanka in the opening match of the Women's World Cup, overcoming a significant mid-innings collapse. After losing four wickets for just four runs, a crucial 103-run partnership between Deepti Sharma and Amanjot Kaur revived the host nation's chances. Sharma also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets to help bowl Sri Lanka out for 211. The match, played in front of a record crowd for a group game, gives India a strong start as they pursue their first World Cup title in either the men's or women's format.</p>

          <p>If Congress fails to pass a funding agreement, a government shutdown will have wide-ranging consequences across the United States. As many as four million federal employees, including military service members and TSA officers, could go without pay, with many deemed essential and required to work regardless. The shutdown would also disrupt numerous federal services, potentially closing national parks, halting food safety inspections, and delaying the distribution of some benefits. Past shutdowns have resulted in billions of dollars in lost economic activity, and the effects are felt nationwide, not just in Washington, D.C.</p>

Trustworthy programs are typically accredited by professional organizations like the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators and have a transparent fee structure that prohibits charging upfront costs before services are rendered. A safe company will also provide honest communication about the inherent risks, such as potential damage to your credit score, and offer a realistic timeline of two to four years for the entire process. They must also handle funds through a federally insured account that the consumer controls.</p>

In contrast, Cramer suggests that while index funds should form about half of a portfolio, individuals can and should also research and select individual stocks in an effort to achieve above-average returns.

It no longer implies a centrist viewpoint but rather encompasses a diverse range of voters who simply reject partisan labels. This shift is driven by a political primary system that rewards conformity, leaving many general election voters feeling alienated from the candidates presented to them.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is facing another shutdown as Congress struggles to reach a funding agreement before the fiscal year deadline. This year's threat is considered more serious due to a White House directive for agencies to prepare for permanent mass layoffs, a sharp escalation from the temporary furloughs of past shutdowns. The political impasse stems from Republican insistence on a short-term funding bill without policy changes, while Democrats are demanding extensions for healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. If no deal is reached, hundreds of thousands of federal workers could be impacted immediately.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. For an $80,000 HELOC, current estimates place the monthly payment at approximately $966 for a 10-year repayment period and $759 for a 15-year period. While these costs are lower than in previous months, homeowners should remember that HELOCs have variable interest rates.

          <p>The widely misunderstood "7-year rule" for credit card debt has three main implications for consumers. Primarily, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most negative information like unpaid debts must be removed from a credit report after seven years from the first delinquency. Secondly, this timeline often aligns with state statutes of limitations, which typically prevent creditors from suing to collect the debt after a similar period. However, it is crucial to understand that the debt itself does not vanish; collectors can still attempt to contact you for payment, even if legal options are off the table.

          <h2>Trump Warns of 'Irreversible' Actions if Government Shuts Down</h2>

          <p>As a government shutdown deadline approached, President Donald Trump issued a warning to congressional Democrats, stating that a shutdown would empower his administration to take "irreversible" actions. He suggested this could include cutting programs favored by Democrats and implementing widespread layoffs of federal workers, effectively using the funding lapse as a tool to trim the budget in ways not otherwise possible. The president's comments escalate the political stakes, framing the shutdown not just as a pause in government function but as an opportunity to enact permanent changes to the federal workforce and its programs.</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley anticipates a sharp decline in electric vehicle demand following the end of the $7,500 federal tax incentive. He stated he wouldn't be surprised if the EV market share in the U.S. drops from a current high of around 10-12% to just 5% once the credit is no longer available. Farley noted that the policy change will create stress on the industry's EV capacity and battery plant investments. He also observed that customers have shown a greater acceptance of hybrid vehicles, or "partial electrification," as they find purely electric vehicles to be too expensive.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners considering a large home equity loan, a $200,000 loan currently translates to monthly payments of approximately $2,463 for a 10-year term or $1,936 for a 15-year term. These costs are slightly lower following recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the loan offers a fixed interest rate, providing payment predictability. However, taking on such a significant debt requires careful consideration, as the home serves as collateral, and failure to make payments can result in foreclosure. The viability of such a loan depends heavily on the individual's financial stability and equity position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of House Democrats has expressed concern that the Trump administration may be improperly seizing the tax refunds of defaulted student loan borrowers. In a letter to the Education Secretary, they argue that the government is failing to provide the required 60-day notice before the offset occurs, leading to severe financial hardships like evictions for affected families. The lawmakers suggest that notices issued years ago, before the pandemic-era pause on collections, are being considered sufficient, despite significant changes in borrowers' lives. This action could impact millions of borrowers who are currently in or near default.</p>

          <p>Seventy years ago, actor James Dean was killed in a car crash at the age of 24, a tragedy that cemented his status as an enduring cultural icon. Despite having made only three films, including "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant," his brooding performances captured a sense of youthful angst that resonated deeply with the 1950s generation. His death at the peak of his burgeoning fame created a legend of the "live fast, die young" ethos. The site of his fatal accident in Central California remains a point of pilgrimage for fans, and his timeless image continues to symbolize rebellion and vulnerability.</p>

The recommendation stands in stark contrast to the defense's request for a sentence of no more than 14 months.

The new target places a greater emphasis on technical qualifications and skills training, giving them a value more equal to that of a traditional academic degree.

Unions argue that Greek workers are already overworked and underpaid compared to their European counterparts and that the new law would legalize existing labor rights violations.
