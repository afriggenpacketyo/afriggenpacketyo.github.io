          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's economic policies, likening them to those of former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Farage's unfunded tax cut pledges could lead to an economic meltdown, similar to the consequences of Truss's policies. Farage's proposals, including more generous benefits for pensioners and parents and raising the income tax threshold, have been questioned by economists regarding their financial viability. Starmer's speech signals that he views Farage as a primary political opponent, especially after Reform's gains in recent local elections.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in imposing reciprocal tariffs, deeming them unlawful.

The ruling specifically applies to tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking and reciprocal tariffs imposed to address trade imbalances.

The court also noted that the president may only impose tariff rates of 15 percent or lower, and those tariffs may only remain in effect for 150 days. The decision can be appealed, but if upheld, it could significantly limit Trump's ability to impose broad tariffs.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes that they might establish nesting sites. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has translocated juvenile and sub-adult eagles. These eagles have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The return of golden eagles is a positive sign for wildlife conservation, as they were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th century due to persecution.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has stated that the Trump administration's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University student, is likely unconstitutional. The judge argued that the government's justification, citing a potential threat to U.S. foreign policy, could lead to arbitrary enforcement. However, the judge did not order Khalil's release due to concerns about undisclosed information in his residency application. Khalil's attorneys contend that his detention is an attempt to suppress free speech.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has committed to flying a migrant back to the U.S. after a judge ruled that his deportation process ignored due process. The Justice Department confirmed that it is securing a charter flight for the individual, known as O.C.G. The judge had ordered his return after finding that necessary due process steps were not followed in his removal proceedings. O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he sought asylum due to violent attacks in Guatemala.</p>
