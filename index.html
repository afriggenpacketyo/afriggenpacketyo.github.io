          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving at Boston's Logan Airport from Chicago veered off the runway and onto the grass during its landing. The Airbus A220, arriving from O'Hare International Airport, experienced the incident around noon with no reported injuries to passengers or crew. Airport officials temporarily closed runway 33-L to assess the aircraft, with passengers disembarking via stairs and buses to the terminal. The FAA issued a ground stop for departures from Logan, causing delays averaging 30 minutes, while the incident undergoes further investigation. The event underscores the complexities of air travel and the rapid response required by airport personnel to ensure safety. </p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.

Tensions among the jurors were high, with one juror expressing feeling unsafe due to threats from another juror.

They assert there is no rebellion justifying the use of federal troops and that state and local authorities can manage the situation.

          <p>The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) reported that families hid in attics during violent disorder in Ballymena, describing the violence as "racist." The unrest followed a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, resulting in injuries to 41 officers and 13 arrests. Police reinforcements were deployed, and Police Scotland agreed to provide additional support. The violence, primarily in the Clonavon Terrace area, targeted ethnic minorities and law enforcement, with officers facing attacks from petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks. </p>

          <p>Six activists from a Gaza aid boat were deported from Israel after their boat was intercepted while attempting to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza. Among those deported was French-Palestinian European parliament member Rima Hassan. Two other activists remain in Israeli custody and are expected to be deported on Friday. Activists claim mistreatment and punitive measures during their detention, while Israel maintains that unauthorized attempts to breach its blockade are dangerous and unlawful. </p>
