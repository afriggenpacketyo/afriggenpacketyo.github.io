          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who participated in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from Trump. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes accepting the pardon would contribute to a false narrative and propaganda. She feels that accepting the pardon would be hypocritical, as she acknowledges her guilt and the guilt of others involved. Hemphill sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally acknowledge her non-acceptance of the pardon with the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a large-scale drone attack on Russian airfields, which reportedly took 18 months to prepare, sending a message to both Russia and Ukraine's Western allies. The operation, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them remotely at airbases. While the extent of the damage is hard to verify, Ukraine claims to have destroyed or damaged a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet, causing billions of dollars in damage. The attacks also serve as a signal that Ukraine remains committed to the fight, despite Russia's advances and skepticism from some Western allies.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed a list of “sanctuary” states, cities, and counties from its website following criticism from the National Sheriffs’ Association. The association argued that the list of "noncompliant" sheriffs could damage the relationship between the Trump administration and law enforcement. Some city leaders also questioned the sanctuary label. DHS said it would continue to use the sanctuary tally, despite removing the list from its website.</p>

          <p>Advisers to President Trump are defending the administration's tariff policies despite ongoing legal challenges. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted that the tariffs are "not going away," while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would uphold them. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court temporarily paused the ruling. Trump warned that a ruling against the tariffs would allow other countries to hold the U.S. hostage with anti-American tariffs.</p>
