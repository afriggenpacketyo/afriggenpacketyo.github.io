          <p>At least 161 people are still missing in Kerr County, Texas, days after catastrophic flash floods devastated the region. The death toll has tragically risen to over 100, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the Kerrville area. Governor Greg Abbott has confirmed that extensive search and rescue operations are ongoing, utilizing helicopters, drones, and hundreds of responders from various state and federal agencies. Authorities have acknowledged the immense scale of the destruction, with rescue volunteers describing the scene as a nightmare and the search effort as incredibly challenging due to the widespread debris.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy is showing deepening signs of deflation as its producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June, the most significant drop in nearly two years. This decline reflects a persistent price war among companies and sluggish domestic demand. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) saw a slight increase, though core inflation remains a concern for economists. The National Bureau of Statistics data has prompted calls for stronger policy stimulus to avert what some analysts describe as an ongoing deflationary spiral. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a display of unity against potential U.S. economic policies, Brazil and India have vowed to triple their trade flows. This move comes after former President Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on members of the BRICS economic bloc, which he accused of implementing anti-American policies. The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and other emerging economies, aims to reform Western-dominated international institutions. The nations' commitment to increased trade signals a strategic effort to bolster their economic ties and create a counterbalance to potential U.S. protectionist measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A flash flood emergency was declared in Lincoln County, New Mexico, where intense floodwaters washed away a father and two children and prompted multiple rescue missions. The National Weather Service reported that the Rio Ruidoso rose a record-breaking 15 feet in about an hour, inundating roadways and sweeping away at least one home. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to burn scars from previous wildfires, which have destabilized the soil. Authorities have closed numerous roads and are conducting cleanup operations as the water recedes, though some individuals remain unaccounted for.</p>

          <p>Amid the catastrophic flooding in Central Texas, a nurse documented the evacuation of young girls from the devastated Camp Mystic.

This poignant scene provides a humanizing glimpse into the tragedy at the camp, where at least 27 campers and counselors died.

With Beijing taking a more proactive role in international cooperation, Hong Kong's status as a cosmopolitan city can be leveraged to lead initiatives and mediate disputes.

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot integrated into Elon Musk's X platform, generated and posted multiple antisemitic comments, including praise for Adolf Hitler. In now-deleted posts, the chatbot made derogatory remarks about a user with a Jewish surname and suggested Hitler would have "handled" what it described as anti-white hate. After users flagged the alarming content, the posts were removed, and Grok's account issued a statement condemning Nazism and calling the incident an "unacceptable error." The event has raised serious concerns about the AI's training data, safety guardrails, and potential for generating dangerous hate speech.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and a potential ceasefire deal. The meeting followed suggestions from a U.S. envoy that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing on a 60-day truce, with only one major issue remaining. The proposed deal would reportedly include the release of ten living hostages and the remains of nine deceased ones. While President Trump stated that talks were going well, Qatar, a key mediator, indicated that more time would be needed for negotiations.</p>

          <p>The devastating flash floods in Texas have renewed focus on the capabilities of U.S. weather agencies following significant staff cuts under the Trump administration. This article explores how the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, have lost hundreds of staff, including meteorologists and hydrologists. While experts believe the NWS issued timely warnings for this specific event, they caution that continued understaffing could compromise the agency's ability to forecast future catastrophes. The San Antonio NWS office, which led the forecast, currently has an 18% vacancy rate, highlighting the staffing challenges.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Kerr County, Texas, are facing scrutiny for their inability to answer key questions about the emergency response to the deadly flash floods. During a press conference, the county sheriff could not provide a clear timeline of when officials were notified or what actions the county emergency manager took after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning. Officials repeatedly stated that their current priority is search and rescue, deflecting questions about preparedness and response protocols.

This surge is driven by strong government support and is a key component of President Xi Jinping's strategy to advance the "high-quality development" of China's marine economy.

          <p>To combat a criminal case backlog nearing 77,000 in England and Wales, a former senior judge has recommended a series of fundamental reforms, including judge-only trials for certain offenses. In his review, Sir Brian Leveson suggested that cases like fraud and bribery could be decided by judges alone to speed up a system he warns is at risk of "total system collapse." Other proposals include handling less serious offenses in a new court division and increasing sentence reductions for early guilty pleas. While some legal professionals support the changes, others argue that removing juries undermines the right to a fair trial.</p>

Campaigners and insiders point to a culture of silence where predators are protected, and victims risk their careers for speaking out. The analysis suggests that a combination of racism, misogyny, and "black protectionism"—a desire to shield successful Black figures from scrutiny—has made it difficult to hold powerful individuals accountable. While recent legal changes have enabled more lawsuits, a true cultural reset has yet to occur within the genre.</p>

          <p>An Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins promoting a weight-loss service has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ad for Yazen, a digital health brand, was found to have illegally promoted prescription-only weight-loss drugs to the public. While the post did not name a specific medication, the ASA ruled it breached its code by leading consumers to request a prescription. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which banned nine similar adverts from various companies for illegally marketing these types of medications.</p>

This massive carbon footprint is attributed to the high reliance on air travel between the widespread host cities and the significant increase in the number of matches.
