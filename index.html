          <p>A passenger train collision with a slurry tanker has resulted in at least one fatality and 27 injuries near the German border in southern Denmark. The crash, which occurred between the towns of Tinglev and Kliplev, caused several train carriages to derail. A 60-year-old woman was confirmed dead, and among the five seriously injured, two remained in critical condition. Emergency services were on site using a crane to check for any other trapped passengers from the train, which was carrying 106 people, including a group of schoolchildren who were not seriously harmed.</p>

The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines, which will power the superheavy launcher, can operate in sync under various conditions. The Long March-10 is designed to be nearly three times as powerful as China's current most powerful rocket, the Long March-5. The national space agency's plan involves using two of these rockets to separately launch the Mengzhou crew spacecraft and the Lanyue lander for a rendezvous in lunar orbit.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded a high-stakes summit in Alaska without securing a ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. While Trump described the talks as "productive" and noted that progress was made, he stated, "there's no deal until there's a deal." Putin characterized the meeting as constructive and emphasized Russia's interest in ending the conflict but reiterated demands that the "primary roots" of the war be addressed. The meeting, Putin's first visit to the U.S. in a decade, was seen by many as a diplomatic victory for the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, English football icon Wayne Rooney discussed pivotal moments from his career, his challenging foray into management, and his transition into punditry. He recounted a turning point at age 14 when a youth manager confronted him about underage drinking, which focused him on his professional path. Rooney also spoke candidly about the difficulties of management at clubs like Derby County and Birmingham, which led him to pursue a media career. He emphasized his commitment to being an honest pundit and shared personal insights into his family life and efforts to educate himself outside of football.</p>

          <p>Political analysts observe that the Alaska summit provided Russian President Vladimir Putin with a significant diplomatic victory by welcoming him back onto the world stage, complete with a red-carpet reception on U.S. soil. Despite the lengthy discussions, the meeting produced no tangible deliverables, such as a ceasefire or a clear path toward peace in Ukraine. This article notes the unusual dynamic where Putin spoke first and appeared more energetic, while Trump seemed subdued and vague. Ultimately, the summit is framed as a win for Moscow in terms of optics and international standing, even as the core conflict remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is advancing a policy that would require mainland Chinese nationals applying for residency to prove they have relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. The proposed amendment is part of a broader strategy announced by President Lai to counter perceived security threats from Beijing, including infiltration and identity ambiguity. Applicants would need to provide notarized proof of renunciation or have their Chinese passport physically invalidated. This move represents a significant shift in cross-strait residency governance, reflecting heightened security concerns under the current administration.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, ending a recent poor run of form and moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered six strong innings, and the bullpen successfully protected a narrow lead, a notable improvement from their recent struggles. The win came despite the team placing infielder Max Muncy on the injured list before the game. A seventh-inning home run by Teoscar Hernández provided the decisive run in a tightly contested game that the Dodgers needed to win to halt their slide.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to rescind its order that would have placed Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal command. The decision came after the city filed a lawsuit and an emergency court hearing where a judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the takeover. Under the new agreement, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain control of the force, while a federal official will act as an intermediary. The revised directive still requires the MPD to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, a point of contention that will see further legal arguments.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a controversial proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps in an effort to gain up to five U.S. House seats. This move is positioned as a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas and aims to bolster the Democratic party's chances of controlling Congress. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. Critics, including Republicans and former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, have condemned the proposal as partisan gerrymandering that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections found that Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of murder, spent six months meticulously planning his escape from a state prison. Hardin told investigators that "very lax" security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform. He escaped after a tower guard unlocked a gate for him without confirming his identity. The report details multiple procedural failures, leading to the firing of two employees and highlighting systemic security issues that enabled the high-profile escape.</p>

Mayor Matt Mahan expressed hope that this new housing model will be adopted by other cities to help address the state's housing crisis.

The plaintiff claims this practice violates federal and state wiretap and privacy laws.

          <p>A new study indicates that dust from the shrinking Salton Sea's exposed shoreline is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the sea have been the focus of efforts to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. The report's authors suggest that since pollution comes from numerous sources like agriculture and diesel exhaust, a better strategy may be to focus on exposure control. This would involve improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools rather than solely concentrating on source control at the sea.</p>
