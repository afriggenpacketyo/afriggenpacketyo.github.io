          <p>The UK is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to reach 31C on Sunday after peaking on Saturday. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions in England, warning of risks to the wider population, especially the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The hot, dry weather has led to hosepipe bans for millions and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland, with firefighters also battling blazes in Surrey. The heatwave is expected to break on Monday with cooler temperatures and rain, though scientists note that climate change is making such events more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal in the death of John O'Keefe, she has secured a book deal, while witnesses and the victim's family report facing continued harassment. Key figures in the case, including witness Jennifer McCabe and the Albert family, have hired private security due to alleged online targeting by Read's supporters. A witness told Fox News that the Norfolk District Attorney's Office has not offered protection, leading to a feeling of abandonment. Meanwhile, the lead state police detective was fired for misconduct, and the special prosecutor in the case was paid over half a million dollars for his work.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams in Tibet May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Flow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers preliminary evidence that could ease concerns in India about China's planned mega-dam in Tibet creating a water crisis. By analyzing data from two existing large dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that downstream water flows to India actually increased during the dry season. The data, measured since 2014, showed low flows were up by over 50% in February. Contrary to fears of drought, the study indicates that these upstream dams have so far resulted in more, not less, water for India during its driest periods.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers from both parties have toured the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades for the first time. Democratic representatives described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat in the medical area, small food portions, and claims from detainees about lack of showers and water. They were not permitted to take photos inside the facility. In contrast, Republican lawmakers stated they were satisfied, with one senator describing the beds as comfortable. State officials have consistently denied the allegations of inhumane conditions, stating the facility meets all required standards.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. In a letter, Trump cited persistent trade deficits and a lack of reciprocity, warning of even higher taxes if the trade partners retaliate. The EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened "proportionate countermeasures" while remaining open to negotiations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum insisted the country's sovereignty is non-negotiable. The move is part of a broader tariff strategy by the Trump administration, which has now proposed new trade conditions on 24 countries and the EU.</p>

Tensions flared after the Justice Department and FBI announced they would not release additional records and that a rumored "client list" never existed, a move that angered some of Trump's far-right supporters. The fallout reportedly led to a confrontation between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, fueling speculation about division within the administration.

While proponents tout health benefits like no cholesterol and lower saturated fats, the industry faces significant hurdles, including high production costs and consumer skepticism about ultra-processed foods. Despite a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales, companies are targeting a "silent revolution," hoping to first replace cheese in products like frozen pizzas before reaching supermarket shelves.</p>

Mr. Renwick, who had recently been evicted from a nearby farm, faced police searches and public shunning, even resorting to wearing a disguise. Both individuals were later cleared, and two other men were convicted, but the experience highlights the dangerous consequences of premature public speculation and online vigilantism.</p>

          <p>An Italian music festival in the Campania region is facing widespread criticism for inviting Russian conductor Valery Gergiev to perform, breaking a widespread European ban on the artist. Gergiev, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, has been barred from most European stages since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine for refusing to condemn the war. The regional leader, Vincenzo de Luca, defended the decision, insisting culture should not be influenced by politics. However, critics, including a European Parliament vice-president and Ukrainian activists, have condemned the move, labeling Gergiev a "cultural mouthpiece for Putin" and part of the Kremlin's strategic propaganda efforts.</p>

De Paula, who is currently ranked as the top prospect in the Dodgers' farm system, expressed how the moment was emotionally significant, especially with his father in attendance. The performance showcased the considerable talent of the young player, who hopes to remain with the Dodgers organization for a long time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a precarious future as the industry faces decline, high energy costs, and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. The closure of blast furnaces at Tata Steel in Port Talbot has already cost thousands of jobs, shaking the identity of a community built on steelmaking. While a 25% U.S. tariff on UK steel remains, a key concern is that the U.S. may not consider Tata's product "UK steel" since it is imported from India before being finished. This uncertainty adds to the challenges facing an industry that was once a cornerstone of the British economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he is considering resigning from his position. The speculation arose from reports of his unhappiness with a joint Justice Department and FBI decision to conclude the review of the Jeffrey Epstein case without releasing a "client list" or other files anticipated by some conservatives. The decision caused a backlash among some of President Trump's supporters and reportedly led to a "heated confrontation" between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In a social media post, Patel dismissed the reports as "conspiracy theories" and affirmed his commitment to serving the president.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, a crucial source of the world's coltan, which is currently controlled by M23 rebels. The vast site, which holds 15% of the global coltan supply, employs over 10,000 miners working in difficult conditions. The M23, which took control of the area last year, claims to have brought security and organization to the mining operations, though a UN report alleges the group profits heavily by taxing the mineral. This access comes as a fragile US-brokered ceasefire between DR Congo and Rwanda is in place, with the US reportedly seeking mineral rights in the region.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the UK reality show Love Island is experiencing a resurgence, driven largely by its massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV ratings have improved, the show's official accounts have gained 1.8 million followers in 2025, with TikTok clips often garnering more views than entire broadcast episodes. Content creators and fans note that short-form recaps and commentary make it easier to keep up with the daily drama and participate in the online discourse. This shift in consumption habits suggests that social media has become essential for the show's survival and ability to attract new, younger audiences.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Arizona's Kaibab National Forest near the Grand Canyon has grown over 20-fold in 24 hours, scorching more than 20,000 acres and forcing evacuations. This comes as smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada is drifting south, blanketing much of the Upper Midwest and causing "unhealthy" to "very unhealthy" air quality across several states. In Canada, the province of Manitoba is under a state of emergency with over 12,000 people evacuated due to the fires. The concurrent events highlight an intensifying wildfire season, with officials warning of dangerous conditions due to both the flames and the widespread smoke.</p>

One couple saved thousands on a honeymoon to Mexico by booking just two days before departure, finding it cheaper than a trip to Europe. Another family saved over £3,000 on a trip to Spain by traveling off-peak and using a "free child place" filter on travel websites. Other money-saving hacks include using home-swapping websites to get free accommodation, collecting credit card points for flights, and house-sitting to enjoy a holiday with minimal lodging costs.</p>

The victims included at least 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic, a youth summer camp that was devastated when the river rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. The disaster was caused by a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone region while many were asleep. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the lack of timely warnings and evacuation orders, with some survivors stating they received no alerts before the deluge hit.</p>

The St. Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children, who were often shunned and separated from their families. The unmarked grave was discovered in a defunct sewage tank structure after research by a local historian, Catherine Corliss, revealed the high number of child deaths with no corresponding burial records. The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a measure of truth to a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>
