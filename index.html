        <h2>Trump's Minerals Deal and its Impact on Green Technology</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-13 21:26:54 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Donald Trump's focus on acquiring critical minerals, essential for both defense and green technology, could have an unexpected positive knock-on effect on the US green technology sector.  While China dominates the market, Trump's actions might accelerate US mining and processing, though the timeline is uncertain. The Inflation Reduction Act's success in boosting green investment in Republican states adds another layer of complexity.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The Trump administration requested military options to ensure unfettered access to the Panama Canal, raising concerns about potential conflict.  Trump claims China controls the canal and threatens US interests, a claim disputed by Panamanian officials.  Any military action would likely violate international law.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The CDC's Traveler Genomic Surveillance Program tests airplane wastewater at four major US airports for seven viruses.  While this program provides early warning of potential outbreaks, experts worry its limited scope may not adequately prepare the US for future pandemics.  The program successfully detected new COVID variants weeks before they appeared elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he will vote to keep the government open, likely preventing a shutdown.  He criticized the Republican funding bill but argued a shutdown would give Trump and Musk excessive power to cut federal services.

Witnesses described the killings of civilians, including a rapper and his family, and other young men.  The M23 has not responded to the allegations, and an independent investigation is unlikely. The situation is characterized by fear and silence among residents.</p>
