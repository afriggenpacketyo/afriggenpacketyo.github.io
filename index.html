          <p>A married couple from Rhode Island, Thomas and Agatha Perkins, died when their small plane crashed on Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, igniting in flames. The crash led to a highway shutdown and also injured a woman driving on the highway, who was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, which involved a Socata TBM-700 aircraft that had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport en route to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Witnesses described a chaotic scene with wreckage strewn across the highway, and officials are still determining if weather conditions were a contributing factor to the incident. The community mourns the loss of the couple, who were known for their contributions to historic restoration through their company, Kirby-Perkins Construction, leaving behind a somber atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Carrie Elizabeth Romney, the sister-in-law of former Utah Senator Mitt Romney, was discovered dead near a shopping mall in Santa Clarita, California. Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding her death, speculating that the 64-year-old may have fallen or jumped from a five-story parking structure. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner is conducting tests, including toxicology reports, to determine the official cause of death, which could take several months to finalize. Mitt Romney, who previously served as the governor of Massachusetts and was the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, has not yet released a public statement regarding the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Tina, a brain injury survivor, has found a new means of communication through British Sign Language (BSL) after struggling to speak following a traumatic accident in 2018. The accident, which left her in a coma for six weeks, significantly impacted her ability to speak, prompting her to learn BSL. Tina and her husband Mark participated in a BBC series where actress Rose Ayling-Ellis taught BSL to older residents, which allowed her to gain confidence and a new way to express herself. Now, Tina has earned a Level 1 BSL qualification and Mark leads regular practice sessions, highlighting the benefits of sign language for communication and emotional understanding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and other world leaders convened in Egypt to sign a Gaza peace deal following the release of all living hostages by Hamas. The agreement, dubbed "The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity," outlines commitments to protect human rights and resolve disputes diplomatically. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent due to a Jewish holiday, Trump praised him as a great wartime leader during an address to Israel's parliament. Trump also emphasized the need for rebuilding Gaza and urged Iran to engage in peace negotiations, signaling a potential shift in regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Two Venezuelan activists, Yendri Velasquez and Luis Peche, were shot and injured in Bogota, Colombia, in what authorities suspect was a targeted attack. Velasquez, an LGBTQ+ and human rights activist, and Peche, a political analyst, have been living in Colombia since 2024 after alleging political persecution in Venezuela. Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado condemned the attack, calling for a thorough investigation by the Colombian government. The incident highlights the ongoing political and economic crises that have driven millions of Venezuelans to seek refuge in neighboring countries, with Colombia offering asylum and protections for human rights activists.</p>

          <p>In Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, the Milwaukee Brewers executed a strange double play against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Max Muncy hit a long drive to center field, which Brewers center fielder Sal Frelick misplayed off his glove, hitting the wall. Frelick recovered and threw the ball to the infield, where the defense forced out Teoscar Hernandez. Will Smith misjudged the play, allowing William Contreras to tag him out at third, ending the inning and preventing the Dodgers from scoring. The Dodgers, defending their 2024 World Series title, are competing against the Brewers, who are back in the NLCS for the first time since 2018.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation, Assembly Bill 749, to study inequalities in youth sports, creating a commission to examine access regardless of race, sex, or gender identity. The move follows controversy over transgender athletes, with some Republicans arguing the bill is intended to support transgender participation. The commission will assess the need for a new state board to improve access, addressing disparities in participation among different racial groups. The legislation aims to promote equal opportunities in youth sports and address systemic barriers that limit access for many children.</p>

Jewish community leaders express relief at the hostage release but acknowledge the devastation in Gaza. The protests have raised concerns about antisemitism and free speech, leading to ongoing debates and investigations on campuses.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has entered the national battle over redistricting, as Republicans and Democrats aim to redraw congressional maps to shift the balance of power. Following actions in California and Texas, North Carolina Republicans are attempting to nullify Democrat redistricting efforts. This political struggle involves redrawing electoral boundaries to favor a specific party, known as gerrymandering, which is legal unless racially motivated. The efforts could significantly impact the 2026 midterms, as both parties seek to gain control of the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC cautioned that the recent market rally was driven by too many speculative stocks, which he sees as unreliable leadership. He prefers when established companies lead market gains, rather than risky investments in sectors like nuclear power and quantum computing. The market rebounded after President Trump's tariff threats against China, but Cramer noted that speculative stocks saw the biggest gains. He highlighted the potential for volatility in these investments, as their share prices rise quickly without substantial profits, creating market froth.</p>

          <p>The government is advising organizations to prepare for potential cyber-attacks by creating backup plans using pen and paper, as recent hacks have caused significant disruptions. The National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) has reported an increase in severe cyber-attacks, urging businesses to focus on "resilience engineering." These plans should detail how to operate without IT systems and rebuild them quickly following an attack. While the total number of attacks remained steady, there was a notable rise in nationally significant incidents, prompting the government to recommend better use of free cybersecurity tools.</p>
