          <p>At least 43 people, including 15 children, have died after catastrophic flash floods struck central Texas's Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming local communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, from which over two dozen campers remain missing. Hundreds of people have been rescued, some found clinging to trees, in a massive ongoing search-and-rescue operation involving state and federal agencies. Officials stated the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, and the region, which lacks a comprehensive warning system, was caught by surprise by the flood's ferocity.</p>

Renee Smajstrla, 8, was described by her family as having the "time of her life" at Camp Mystic before being swept away by the floodwaters. Jane Ragsdale, the director and co-owner of the Heart O' the Hills camp, was also killed and is being mourned as the "heart and soul" of the institution. These personal stories highlight the profound human tragedy unfolding as authorities continue to identify victims from the catastrophic event.</p>

          <h2>Officials Face Scrutiny Over Warning Systems and Response to Deadly Texas Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:15:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As rescue efforts continue in Texas, officials are facing intense scrutiny over the preparedness and timeliness of their response to the catastrophic flooding. While the National Weather Service issued increasingly urgent warnings in the early morning hours, many residents and summer camps were caught unaware by the rapidly rising waters. Kerr County's top elected official admitted that "nobody saw this coming" and that a proposal for a flood warning siren system was abandoned years ago due to cost. The disaster has prompted questions about evacuation protocols and the effectiveness of current alert systems in preventing such a high loss of life.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," following an informal poll on his social media platform, X. The move comes shortly after President Donald Trump signed a $3.3 trillion spending bill, which Musk has vocally opposed, citing concerns about national debt and wasteful spending. Musk stated the party's goal is to secure a few key seats in Congress to act as a swing bloc, thereby breaking the influence of what he calls the "one-party system." The announcement has drawn criticism from some conservatives who fear it could split their voter base.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump's unpredictable and often contradictory approach to foreign policy aligns with the "Madman Theory," a strategy where a leader feigns irrationality to gain concessions. By questioning long-standing commitments like NATO's Article 5 and embracing adversaries, Trump has successfully pressured European allies to significantly increase their defense spending. However, the article questions whether this doctrine, which relies on a reputation for volatility, can be effective against entrenched adversaries like Russia and Iran. Critics suggest this approach could ultimately undermine U.S. credibility and lead to greater global instability.</p>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings product, is dividing opinion among savers and financial experts. Designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement, it offers a 25% government bonus on up to £4,000 saved annually. While some users have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, many others have been penalized by its strict rules. Key criticisms include a significant penalty for early withdrawal and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not been updated since 2017, making it obsolete in many parts of the country.

For decades, a combination of scientific advancement, public health initiatives, and activism has transformed HIV from a death sentence into a manageable condition.

While President Trump expressed optimism about a potential deal, the conflicting statements highlight the significant gaps that remain between the two sides.

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and subsequently released from the hospital after responding to a call at an ICE detention facility late on the Fourth of July. Officials report that when officers arrived, suspects opened fire, leading to a chase that resulted in the arrest of several armed individuals. A federal law enforcement source indicated that a group of masked individuals had vandalized the facility's parking lot and launched fireworks, possibly to lure police to the scene. The Justice Department stated it is closely monitoring the incident and has zero tolerance for assaults on federal officers.</p>

          <p>Heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath played their final concert in their hometown of Birmingham, with frontman Ozzy Osbourne taking the stage for a powerful farewell performance. Despite his Parkinson's disease, the 76-year-old Osbourne sang from a throne, joined by the original band lineup for the first time in 20 years. The all-day event, dubbed the "heavy metal Live Aid," featured an all-star lineup of rock legends including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, who paid tribute to the band's immense influence. The emotional show concluded with the classic anthem "Paranoid," marking the end of an era for the genre.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as Western nations begin to re-engage with the country following the fall of the Assad regime. The new government is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group formerly proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK. Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" and will use humanitarian aid to encourage stability, inclusivity, and accountability. The visit comes amid international concern over recent violent attacks against minority groups and fears that the new government is restricting social freedoms and marginalizing women.</p>

          <p>A Nottingham-based Islamic charity has received an official warning and one of its trustees has been disqualified after an "inflammatory" sermon was delivered just days after the October 7 Hamas attacks. The Charity Commission found that the sermon included divisive language and that the trustee, who is not a trained imam, failed to provide appropriate context. The regulator deemed this a case of misconduct, noting that no consideration was given to the sensitive timing of the sermon. This is one of over 300 cases the commission has investigated related to the Middle East conflict since late 2023.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards at Newport Beach rescued 350 people on the July Fourth holiday as powerful and dangerous rip currents created hazardous swimming conditions. One particularly large "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 people far from shore, requiring a significant rescue effort involving lifeboats and assistance from a police helicopter. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions and strong rip currents for coastal areas throughout Southern California through the weekend.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly halted a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, with Democrats alleging he falsely cited concerns about low U.S. weapon stockpiles. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused supplies, delaying critical air defense missiles and munitions needed by Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks. While President Trump defended the pause as necessary to ensure U.S. readiness, Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee insist that stockpile numbers do not justify the decision.

Kartal, who has risen rapidly in the world rankings after overcoming injuries and a period of being self-funded, draws inspiration from other shorter players like Jasmine Paolini.

          <p>The England cricket team's aggressive "Bazball" philosophy, which has famously rejected playing for a draw, is facing its ultimate test against India. Needing an effectively impossible 536 runs on the final day to win, England's most realistic path to preserving their series lead is to bat for a draw. For the first time since the approach was adopted, assistant coach Marcus Trescothick has hinted at flexibility, stating the team is not "stupid enough" to ignore the possibility of a draw. This potential shift in strategy will be closely watched on the final day of the Edgbaston Test.</p>

The ranking is based on feedback from over 300,000 vehicle owners regarding issues across various categories. Subaru's success is attributed to its conservative redesigns, use of shared components across a relatively small model lineup, and a back-to-basics approach that minimizes new technology risks. The Forester model was a standout performer with a near-perfect reliability rating, significantly boosting the brand's overall score.</p>
