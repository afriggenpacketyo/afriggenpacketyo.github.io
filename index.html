          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that intelligence indicates Russia is planning new offensive operations, dismissing any suggestions of genuine peace negotiations. Zelenskyy emphasized that Russia's actions show a disregard for global peace efforts, highlighting the ongoing drone attacks between the two nations as evidence of escalating conflict. Ukraine's air force reported neutralizing a significant number of Russian air attack vehicles, while Russia claimed to have downed numerous Ukrainian drones. These near-nightly strikes underscore the protracted nature of the war and the absence of any immediate resolution. Optimism regarding de-escalation remains low given these developments.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering reallocating $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools nationwide, citing Harvard's alleged antisemitism and slow response to requests for information on foreign students. The funds in question are part of existing cuts the administration has already announced, rather than new reductions. This proposal follows Trump's previous suggestion of taxing large university endowments to fund an American Academy with free online educational content. The potential shift raises questions about the future of scientific research currently funded at Harvard, as trade schools typically focus on practical skills rather than scientific studies.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the longtime congressman from Harlem, passed away at the age of 94, leaving behind a significant legacy in the community he represented for over four decades.

He served as the first Black chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, though his career was marked by ethical lapses that led to his censure.

This action comes amid ongoing debates over voter identification and election integrity, with citizens set to vote on the amendment in November.

          <p>A growing number of small-scale distillers in Japan are producing craft gins with homegrown ingredients, contributing to a domestic gin boom. These distillers are using local specialties to create unique flavors, such as bitter gourd from Okinawa and camellia flowers from the Goto Islands. The flexibility of gin production, which doesn't require aging, allows for quick monetization and encourages shochu and whiskey makers to utilize existing facilities. The trend has also spurred the rise of gin-dedicated bars and e-commerce sites, with major manufacturers joining the market by releasing canned gin products.</p>

Researchers are analyzing the complex ways sound waves travel, aiming to inform regulations and minimize disturbances. This research is becoming increasingly important as SpaceX tests Starship, the largest and potentially loudest rocket ever built, with the goal of frequent launches.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is calling on resident doctors in England to vote against industrial action in an upcoming ballot. Streeting argues that strikes would hinder progress in the NHS and that the government's proposed 5.4% average pay rise for resident doctors is substantial. However, resident doctors argue that the pay increase is insufficient to compensate for below-inflation pay awards since 2008, and their union is encouraging members to vote in favor of strike action.</p>

          <p>The government is implementing a shake-up of apprenticeship funding, focusing resources on training opportunities for individuals under 21 years old in England. The changes involve scrapping funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, for those over 21, shifting the financial burden to employers. This move aims to address the decline in entry-level apprenticeships and create 120,000 more training places for young adults. The shift has drawn criticism for potentially undermining advanced training in sectors like healthcare and limiting professional opportunities for those who don't attend university.</p>

However, Bitcoin has since surged over 380%, reaching $112,000 this month, demonstrating Cramer's inaccurate prediction. This misfire is not unique, as Cramer's stock recommendations have often been incorrect, leading to the phenomenon known as the 'Cramer Curse.'

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, has become the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing the 62-mile journey to advocate for shark protection. Pugh undertook the swim to challenge negative perceptions of sharks, which he says were unfairly portrayed in the film "Jaws." Swimming in frigid waters for multiple hours daily, he aimed to raise awareness about the threats sharks face and the need for their conservation. He hopes to change public attitudes and emphasize the importance of sharks for a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>
