        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. According to a spokesperson, the company is not modifying any GPU designs for China to comply with these restrictions. A source familiar with the matter clarified that Nvidia is leasing new space in Shanghai for existing employees, continuing its longstanding presence in the region without transferring intellectual property or GPU designs. This statement follows reports that CEO Jensen Huang discussed establishing a new R&D center in Shanghai to assess compliance with U.S. regulations while catering to the local market, with actual production and design remaining outside China.</p>

          <p>Staff employees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts are moving to unionize, citing months of layoffs and job uncertainty following changes initiated by the Trump administration. More than 150 employees across various departments, including education, donor relations, and arts programming, are concerned about the institution's mission and legacy. Staff members report a lack of transparency and communication from leadership, with ticket sales reportedly down 50%. The unionization effort aims to restore job security and improve communication, with employees planning to vote with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).</p>

          <p>The Justice Department and Boeing are reportedly close to a deal that would allow the aerospace giant to avoid a guilty plea or trial in a criminal case related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. This potential deal follows a previous agreement where Boeing would plead guilty to a fraud charge, which was later rejected by a judge due to concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion. The fraud charge is tied to Boeing's development of the 737 Max, with accusations of misleading regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes. This resolution would be the latest development in holding Boeing accountable for the crashes.</p>

Local police are treating the disappearance as theft and have launched an investigation. The statue, commissioned by US artist Brad Downey, was intended to be durable and resistant to destruction, but it was ultimately removed from its base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years, according to a memo from Chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will involve consolidating functions, modernizing business practices, and offering voluntary deferred resignation programs to eligible employees. This initiative aims to ensure the Fed is right-sized and able to meet its statutory mission. The central bank had nearly 24,000 employees in 2023, and a 10% reduction would bring the number below 22,000. This decision comes amid calls for cost cuts across civil service agencies, though Powell's memo did not explicitly mention these external pressures.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting a photo on Instagram of seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some interpreted as a call for violence against President Trump. Comey deleted the image and claimed he didn't realize the numbers had violent connotations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel have stated that the post is under investigation. President Trump has responded, claiming Comey knew exactly what the post meant and calling it a "terrible thing."</p>
