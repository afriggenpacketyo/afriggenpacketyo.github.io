          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 01:03:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. The election result is a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to obstruct Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, bolstering the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic values and Polish sovereignty within the EU, while also advocating for continued support for Ukraine, although he opposes its NATO and EU membership during the ongoing conflict with Russia. The optimism score reflects the divided political landscape in Poland following the close election. </p>

          <p>A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a "targeted act of violence" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails at a march in support of Israeli hostages, injuring eight people. Soliman was reportedly heard yelling "free Palestine" during the attack, which is now being investigated as an act of terrorism. The victims included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one person in critical condition. The optimism score is notably low given the intentional and violent nature of the attack. </p>

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson and its affiliate Brickworks announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, causing their shares to surge. The new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity with A$13.1 billion in holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger aims to simplify the structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, a 10.1% premium over the previous closing price (not investment advice). The optimism score is relatively high given the positive market reaction to the merger announcement. </p>
