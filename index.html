          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's new 50% tariff on Brazil, even though the U.S. has a trade surplus with the country. Hassett argued the move is part of a comprehensive global strategy to onshore production and reduce the national security risk posed by a large overall trade deficit. He stated that without a consistent strategy across all countries, objectives could be undermined by practices like transshipping, framing the tariff as a necessary component of a larger economic plan.
