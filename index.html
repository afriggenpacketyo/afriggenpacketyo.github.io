          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs are significantly slowing global economic growth and increasing inflation. The IMF's report forecasts a reduced global growth rate of 2.8% for 2025, citing lower bilateral trade between the U.S. and China as a major factor. Germany's economic growth is projected to be zero in 2025. The IMF also notes heightened financial stability risks due to tighter financial conditions and increased economic uncertainty. Mexico has rejected the IMF's pessimistic economic projections for its own economy.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans have a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. The survey reveals that Musk is a highly polarizing figure, with Democrats and independents holding largely unfavorable opinions. Tesla's struggles may stem from the fact that potential customers are more positive about electric vehicles in general than they are about the company. Republicans, however, are strongly positive on Tesla but negative on EVs overall.</p>

While gold is considered a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, the stock market rally on hopes of easing trade tensions led to a decrease in gold prices.
