          <p>Former US President Donald Trump has reiterated his strong support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and stated he would "absolutely" consider ordering new strikes on Iran if intelligence warranted it. This comes as Iran's foreign minister indicated a readiness to resume nuclear talks with the US, albeit with calls for a more respectful tone from Washington.

          <p>Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia has claimed it launched a ballistic missile targeting a site in southern Israel, an attack the Israeli military said was likely intercepted. The action was framed as a response to the ongoing war in Gaza. Meanwhile, Qatari mediators have expressed cautious optimism, suggesting the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire has created a "window of opportunity" to restart stalled negotiations for a truce in the Gaza Strip.

Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who had ties to a neo-Nazi group, killed the 19-year-old Ivy League student in 2018 because he was gay and Jewish. The defense claimed the killing was an impulsive act of rage, but the jury's verdict means Woodward now faces a sentence of life in prison without parole.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to the mound, pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, his four-seam fastball was clocked at 101.7 mph (164 kph), the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career. Although he went hitless at the plate in the game, his performance as a pitcher was a positive sign in his recovery from elbow surgery. Ohtani stated his velocity naturally increases in high-pressure situations with runners on base.</p>

          <p>New rules banning smoking have gone into effect across France, covering public spaces such as beaches, parks, bus shelters, and areas near schools and libraries. The measure is a key part of the government's plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aims to protect children from the dangers of passive smoking. Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban, however, does not extend to the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed significant institutional failures in the handling of a prolonged stalking case within the Church of England.

The perpetrator was eventually convicted after the victim compiled extensive evidence himself.</p>
