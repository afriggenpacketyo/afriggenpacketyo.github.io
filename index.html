          <p>British energy giant Shell reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a general drop in global oil and gas prices. This performance follows a strategic update in March focusing on shareholder returns, cost savings, and liquified natural gas expansion, which has been positively received by investors. Shell's share price has risen 8% this year, outperforming rivals. The article also notes Shell's recent dismissal of speculation regarding a takeover bid for BP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A system outage at NATS, the UK's air traffic control provider, caused significant disruption, leading to over 150 flight cancellations and thousands of groundings. Airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair expressed strong disappointment, with a Ryanair executive calling for NATS CEO Martin Rolfe's resignation, citing past incidents. The issue, which NATS resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, was radar-related and not cyber-related. Travel experts warn that disruption will continue for days as airlines work to reposition stranded passengers, planes, and crew during the busy summer season.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's August 1st tariff deadline approaches, the global trade landscape remains uncertain, with some major partners securing deals while others face increased levies. Eight framework deals have been completed, setting tariffs higher than pre-Trump levels but lower than threatened rates, with countries like South Korea, the EU, and Japan making significant concessions. However, nations like Brazil, India, Mexico, and Canada still face the prospect of no deal and higher tariffs, often due to political rather than economic impasses. A US court will hear arguments on the president's authority to impose these tariffs, adding another layer of uncertainty to the impending deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two changes to his squad for the third and final Test against the Wallabies in Sydney, with the series already secured.

Despite the series win, Farrell maintained a pragmatic approach, opting against giving Test spots to all players, focusing on team cohesion. Eleven players have been selected to start all three Tests, highlighting the coach's consistency in selection.</p>

          <h2>Former Chinese Envoy Questions EU's Strategic Autonomy Amid US Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat, former ambassador to Germany Shi Mingde, suggests that the recent trade deal between the European Union and the United States may deepen the EU's economic and security dependence on the US. Speaking at an event marking 50 years of China-EU relations, Shi argued that while the EU aims to reduce reliance on China through its "de-risking" policy, its increasing dependence on the US undermines its pursuit of strategic autonomy. Beijing views the de-risking policy as an attempt to contain Chinese growth, particularly in technology and the economy, highlighting a fundamental disagreement in geopolitical strategy.</p>

          <h2>Canada Plans to Recognize Palestinian State in September, PM Carney Announces</h2>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state in September during a UN meeting, aiming to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution. This move is contingent on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to governance reforms and elections without Hamas involvement. Israel criticized the decision as a "reward for Hamas" that harms ceasefire and hostage release efforts. Canada's announcement follows similar intentions from France and the UK, reflecting growing international outrage over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The White House, however, opposes the recognition, with President Trump stating it would be "rewarding Hamas."</p>

Patel met with New Zealand's police, foreign affairs, and spy agency ministers to discuss cooperation on transnational organized crime, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, and espionage.

          <p>Arkansas State Police have arrested James Andrew McGann, 28, in connection with the double homicide of Clinton and Cristen Brink, a couple found dead while hiking with their two young daughters at Devil's Den State Park.

          <p>Ford, the automotive giant, anticipates that President Trump's tariffs will cost the company approximately $2 billion this year, exceeding previous expectations. The firm already incurred an additional $800 million in duties during the second quarter, primarily due to higher-than-expected tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has facilities, and levies on aluminum and steel. While Ford is less impacted than some rivals due to its significant US manufacturing, CEO Jim Farley stated the company is in regular contact with the White House to secure lower tariffs, especially on vehicle parts.

South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung stated the deal includes a $350 billion investment fund to facilitate Korean companies' entry into US industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, with $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding cooperation. While US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed "90% of the profits" from the investment would go to Americans, Seoul's interpretation differs, expecting mutual benefits and reinvestment. The deal also includes a $100 billion purchase of US LNG and energy products by Seoul. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill, AB 379, increasing penalties for some offenders who solicit 16- and 17-year-olds for sex, allowing felony charges for first offenses if the suspect is at least three years older than the minor. This "wobbler" provision targets older "johns," avoiding felony charges for all younger offenders. The bill faced controversy as Democrats initially sought amendments, arguing that prosecutorial discretion could harm victims and that a separate provision on loitering with intent to purchase commercial sex might target minorities. The new law also creates a survivor support fund from increased fines on offenders and hoteliers failing to report sexual assault.</p>

          <p>As Canada, France, and the UK announce plans to recognize a Palestinian state, a significant chasm has opened between the US and its traditional allies regarding the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These allies, driven by the escalating humanitarian crisis and widespread starvation in Gaza, are pushing for a rekindling of the two-state solution, even without US participation. The Trump administration has boycotted such international efforts, having previously abandoned its own "day after" principles for Gaza. This diplomatic divergence highlights a strategic vacuum from the US on Gaza's long-term governance, prompting European and Arab nations to lead efforts for urgent aid and a peace plan.</p>
