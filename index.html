          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 14:50:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. This move follows a request from a lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being seen on Saipan. While the prevailing theory is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan crashed after running out of fuel, alternative theories, including that she was on a US spy mission and captured by the Japanese, have persisted for decades. It remains unclear what, if any, classified documents exist on the matter.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during racial justice protests in 2020 following the death of George Floyd. A termination letter cited a "lack of judgement," a move the FBI Agents Association condemned as a violation of the agents' rights. The dismissals occur as the Trump administration continues to remove officials and policies it deems left-wing, part of a broader trend of recent high-profile firings within the agency. Proponents of the agents' actions argued the kneeling was a de-escalation tactic rather than a political statement.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace defeated Liverpool with a 97th-minute goal from substitute Eddie Nketiah, ending the match 2-1 and handing the reigning champions their first loss of the season. Palace dominated the first half, with Ismaila Sarr scoring early, but Liverpool equalized late through Federico Chiesa before Nketiah's decisive winner. The victory extends Crystal Palace's unbeaten streak to 18 games in all competitions, moving them to second place in the Premier League table. The result exposed defensive vulnerabilities in a Liverpool side that has relied heavily on late goals this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Labour party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating their policies "will tear this country apart." Starmer specifically condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, calling it one of the "most shocking things" the party has said. As Labour trails Reform in some opinion polls, Starmer is positioning his party as a patriotic alternative to what he describes as Reform's divisive agenda.

          <p>Robert Barnett, a prominent Washington, D.C. attorney known for negotiating major book deals for political figures like the Obamas and Clintons, has died at 79.

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities, particularly an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building that has been a site of protests. In a social media post, Trump stated he was directing the Secretary of War to provide necessary troops and authorized the use of "full force" against what he termed "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." The move drew immediate criticism from Oregon's Democratic governor and Portland's mayor, who asserted that federal intervention was unnecessary and unwelcome in the city.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's tendency to openly admit or boast about actions that past presidents would have concealed is altering the American political landscape. By being transparent about controversial conduct, such as pressuring the attorney general or leveraging his office for business, he seemingly neutralizes the shock value that traditionally fuels political scandals. Observers suggest this strategy creates a "new theory of scandal," where public brazenness is perceived by some supporters as authenticity rather than corruption. This approach, combined with the sheer volume of controversies, desensitizes the public and weakens institutional checks and balances.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and left two others in critical condition. The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, fired from the rooftop of a nearby building before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, noting that unspent shell casings found near the shooter contained anti-ICE messages.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Science reveals that wild chimpanzees regularly consume fermented fruit, ingesting significant amounts of alcohol. Researchers observed chimpanzees in Uganda and the Ivory Coast eating fruits with an average alcohol content of 0.3%. Based on their daily fruit intake, the animals consume an amount of alcohol equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for a human. These findings suggest that regular alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots in primates, rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon, supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, Austin police have identified a suspect in the infamous 1991 quadruple murder at an "I Can't Believe It's Yogurt!" shop. The suspect, Robert Eugene Brashers, was identified through advanced DNA testing; he died by suicide in 1999 during a police standoff. The case involved the killing of four teenage girls—Amy Ayers, Eliza Thomas, and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison—who were bound, shot, and left in the store as it was set on fire. The breakthrough comes after decades of investigation and the wrongful conviction of two other men whose sentences were later overturned.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis has become central to the fight against "nudify" websites after discovering a man had used their social media photos to create explicit deepfake pornography. Using a site called DeepSwap, the man generated sexually explicit images and videos of over 80 women without their consent. The victims, including Jessica Guistolise and law student Molly Kelley, found they had little legal recourse as the images were not publicly distributed. Their experience has spurred legislative action in Minnesota, highlighting a major legal and ethical gap in regulating the rapidly advancing field of generative AI.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products imported into the United States, set to begin on October 1, 2025. The tariffs will not apply to generic drugs or to companies that are currently building or have broken ground on manufacturing plants in America. The move is expected to heavily impact European Union countries like Ireland and Germany, which are major exporters of pharmaceuticals to the U.S. Critics warn the policy could disrupt supply chains, increase costs for American consumers, and potentially limit access to lifesaving treatments.

          <p>This article explores the positive and unified team environment that propelled England's Red Roses to their Women's Rugby World Cup victory. A conscious effort was made to foster a more inclusive and enjoyable atmosphere than in previous campaigns, with scheduled team-bonding activities like movie nights and group dinners. Players also developed their own traditions, from getting commemorative tattoos to running a book club, helping to manage the pressure of being tournament hosts and favorites. This strong sense of camaraderie, where even non-selected players actively supported the team, was a key ingredient in their championship run.</p>

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., son of the Houston Texans' late founder, is suing the National Football League for more than $60 million, alleging "tortious interference." The lawsuit claims the NFL conspired with his brother, current Texans CEO Cal McNair, to remove him from leadership roles within the family's businesses. McNair Jr. alleges he was silenced and excluded after questioning player scandals that could have implicated the league. The suit contends the NFL improperly intervened in the restructuring of the McNair family trust to ensure he could not influence NFL-related matters.</p>

          <p>A new detail has emerged in the investigation into the death of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez, whose body was found in a Tesla registered to singer D4vd. The vehicle had been parked on a Hollywood Hills street long enough for residents to complain, leading to it being ticketed for violating a 72-hour parking ordinance on September 3. The car was impounded two days later, but the girl's body was not discovered in the trunk until September 8. This timeline suggests the car was stationary for an extended period, a key focus for detectives tracing the final movements of the victim.</p>

The facility, Europe's largest nuclear plant, lost its external power connection after the final line was severed, an event Ukraine blames on Russian shelling. The UN's nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned of a potential catastrophe if the cooling systems for the reactor cores and spent fuel fail. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy announced a $90 billion arms deal with the U.S. and criticized Hungary for conducting "dangerous" drone surveillance over Ukraine.</p>
