          <h2>Psychotherapist Debunks Pervasive Mental Health Myths Popularized on Social Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Licensed psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses the oversimplification and misuse of psychological terms online, which can be harmful despite good intentions. In his book "Psychobabble," he tackles myths such as diagnoses defining a person's identity and the vague concept of "people pleasing," arguing that such labels can be limiting and lack necessary nuance. The article emphasizes that while therapy is a useful tool, it is not a prerequisite for relationships, and true mental wellness involves understanding context, agency, and the limits of self-analysis.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians completed a remarkable comeback, erasing a 10-game deficit in under a month to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the American League Central. Cleveland's 5-2 victory was fueled by a strong pitching performance from Gavin Williams and a shaky outing from Tigers' ace Tarik Skubal, who was involved in several uncharacteristic errors. The Tigers' collapse includes seven consecutive losses, while the Guardians now hold the tiebreaker, positioning them favorably for the final games of the season.</p>

The remains, which had gone missing from police custody in the 1950s, were located at a cemetery, renewing hope in the state's oldest unidentified-person case. Investigators will now use advanced forensic testing on the degraded remains, aiming to finally identify the victim and bring closure to a case that has been unresolved for nearly eight decades.</p>

          <p>In response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, North Carolina's legislature has passed a comprehensive criminal justice bill known as "Iryna's Law." The measure aims to tighten bail requirements for violent offenders and mandate more mental health evaluations, addressing public outrage over the suspect's prior release. Controversially, the bill also includes a provision that could restart executions in the state by allowing alternative methods if lethal injection is unavailable, sparking a debate over capital punishment.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested a man in connection with a major cyber-attack that has caused significant disruption at several European airports, including Heathrow. The attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company providing essential check-in and baggage software, forcing airlines to resort to manual processes and causing widespread delays and cancellations. While the arrest is a positive step, the investigation is ongoing, and airports are being advised to prepare for at least another week of manual workarounds.</p>

This departure from his previous suggestions of territorial concessions boosted investor confidence in the defense industry, with major European firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab seeing their share prices climb. The comments were seen by industry leaders as an encouraging sign that the U.S. is increasingly recognizing the reality of the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent announcement from the Trump administration suggesting a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) and autism has provoked a furious backlash from medical experts and the public. Scientists have labeled the association as "utterly spurious," highlighting a lack of scientific foundation for the claims. Pregnant individuals expressed frustration, as their options for pain management are already limited, while others criticized the move as a dangerous, bad-faith distraction from other political issues and an attempt to sow distrust in scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>An article written in partnership with the Prison Journalism Project details the immense challenges incarcerated women face in managing their menstrual cycles. With inadequate supplies of sanitary products, limited access to laundry facilities and cleaning agents, and a lack of privacy, a basic biological function becomes a source of public struggle and shame. The account highlights how the prison system, largely designed for men, disregards the specific needs of women, turning stained underwear into a symbol of the constant indignity they endure.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Portland, Oregon, are in a standoff with the Trump administration over an ICE facility that is allegedly violating its city-issued permits. An investigation found that the federal agency has been holding detainees overnight and in numbers exceeding the limits stipulated in its 2011 conditional use permit. The city has issued a notice of violation to the building's owner, escalating a local conflict that comes amid nightly protests at the facility and broader threats of federal intervention from the president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend of "job hugging" is emerging in the American labor market, as workers choose stability over seeking new opportunities amid economic uncertainty. The rate of people quitting their jobs has fallen to a low not seen since 2016, and hiring has slowed, which experts say could mask rising employee disengagement and underutilization of skills. While low turnover may seem positive for employers, this stagnation poses risks for the broader economy by potentially flattening wage growth and reducing overall market momentum.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the conservative alignment with the anti-vaccine movement, exemplified by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which is rooted in a misplaced nostalgia for a "natural" past. This viewpoint romanticizes an era before widespread vaccination, ignoring the reality of high infant mortality and deadly childhood diseases like measles and smallpox that are now rare. The author argues that this fantasy of a healthier, pre-modern world is dangerously wrong and risks relinquishing the hard-won public health successes of the last century.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that in the wake of his assassination, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being posthumously transformed into a martyr for the MAGA movement, a process that mirrors the veneration of martyrs in early Christianity and Islam. This reframing shifts Kirk from a political commentator to a revered religious figure, blurring his specific Pentecostal faith into a generic "MAGA Christianity" to unify various conservative religious factions. This creation of a martyr could help the movement evolve from a personality cult around Donald Trump into a broader, more enduring faith.</p>

By featuring pointed jokes and a segment with Robert De Niro, Kimmel signaled that the recent controversy has only strengthened his commitment to scrutinizing the administration.</p>
