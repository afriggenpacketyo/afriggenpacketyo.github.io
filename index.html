          <p>Cassandra Ventura, in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, testified about her early relationship with Combs, describing him as sweet and attentive. The jury was shown affectionate messages exchanged between them, including Ventura's declaration of love. However, the defense challenged Ventura's claims of sexual assault, presenting messages suggesting her willing participation in sexual events, which Ventura denied. Ventura pushed back against the defense's insinuation that she willingly participated in 'freak off' sex sessions to please Combs, saying there was 'a lot more to that'.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that a recession is still a serious possibility for the U.S., even after recent tariff rollbacks on China. While he acknowledges the tariff pauses are a positive sign, he emphasized that import taxes remain significantly higher than the previous year, potentially hindering investment. Dimon deferred to his bank's economists, who estimate recession odds at just below 50%, a slight improvement from last month's forecast. He stressed the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the need for continued dialogue to mitigate economic damage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York Times article explores the growing concern over 'debanking,' where financial institutions close accounts or deny services based on political positions. While some view it as discrimination, others see it as banks exercising discretion to manage risk and profitability. Figures like Brian P. Brooks are advocating for stricter regulations to prevent politically motivated debanking. The Trump administration has taken steps to address these concerns, including ceasing enforcement of a bank regulatory tool related to reputational risk, while Senator Elizabeth Warren has also raised concerns about individuals and businesses whose A.T.M. cards are shut off without warning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article examines how the 'reverse logistics' industry, which recirculates overstocked and returned goods, may benefit from the tariff war with China. As retailers reduce orders due to tariffs, companies like ReturnPro, which sort, clean, and repackage returned items, are expected to see increased demand. ReturnPro handles a wide array of goods returned to retailers, potentially generating significant revenue for retailers compared to liquidating or sending them to landfills. With fewer new goods coming in, retailers may rely more on refurbished products to meet consumer demand.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty to federal obstruction charges after allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities at her courthouse. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from an illegal immigrant scheduled for arrest after a court hearing. The trial is set to begin in July, and Dugan's attorneys have moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming she has immunity from criminal prosecution due to acting in her official capacity. Dugan has been suspended from the bench following her arrest.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe accused Nigel Farage's party of being 'the cult of Nigel' and claimed he was a victim of a 'political assassination attempt'. Lowe suggested his relationship with Reform UK soured when Elon Musk praised him more than Farage. Lowe, who was suspended by the party in March, criticized Farage's leadership style as 'brutal' and described his team as 'long-term lightweight sort of servants'. He added that he doesn't think Farage is 'fit to be leader'.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to economic changes and policy uncertainties. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon.

While he didn't mention President Trump's tariffs directly, he has previously suggested they could slow growth and increase inflation.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' after experiencing higher-than-expected growth in the first quarter of the year. The 0.7% growth rate was driven by increased consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts cautioned that this growth may slow due to the impact of US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite the positive figures, Reeves acknowledged that the cost of living crisis remains a reality for many families.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers at 75 U.S. stores initiated a strike in response to the chain's new dress code, impacting over 1,000 employees. The union, Starbucks Workers United, argues that the new policy, requiring solid black shirts and specific bottoms, should be subject to collective bargaining. Workers criticized the company for prioritizing dress code over more pressing issues, like understaffing and long wait times. Starbucks maintains that the strike has limited impact, with over 99% of stores remaining open.</p>

One in four samples exceeded the FDA's limit for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal. While the USA Rice Federation claims that U.S.-grown rice has the lowest arsenic levels, a global concern remains due to rice's widespread consumption. The report also suggests that ancient grains, like farro, generally contain fewer heavy metals, but they contain more cadmium.</p>
