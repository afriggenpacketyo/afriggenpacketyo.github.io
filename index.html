        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur with close ties to Elon Musk, for the position of NASA Administrator. The decision came just days before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote, with Trump citing a "thorough review of prior associations" as the reason for the withdrawal. The White House stated that the next NASA leader must be fully aligned with Trump's "America First" agenda, promising a new nominee soon. Musk expressed his disappointment, praising Isaacman's competence and character, while Isaacman himself had previously voiced his commitment to advancing space exploration under Trump's leadership. The context of this withdrawal involves Trump's desire for complete alignment with his agenda and Musk's support of Isaacman. The article provides a summary of the context around this decision.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is advocating for Asian countries to boost their military spending to counter China's growing influence and military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. Addressing the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth emphasized the need for a credible deterrent against potential Chinese aggression, particularly concerning Taiwan. He drew a parallel to the Trump administration's efforts to encourage European nations to increase their defense spending, suggesting that Asian countries should follow suit. Other news includes Trump's tariffs affecting Georgia's economy, Australia's criticism of US steel tariffs, concerns over US immigration authorities collecting DNA of children, alarms raised by US energy department workers over budget cuts, queer business owners preparing for Pride under Trump, and tensions among Bruce Springsteen's fanbase over his views on Trump.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how George Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently affected John Boehner's early congressional campaign. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a scandal during an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show." Although Boehner's campaign responded, Wendt later apologized, and Boehner still won the election. The article also provides background on the political landscape of Ohio's 8th Congressional District at the time, including the scandal involving Buz Lukens and the challenge posed by Tom Kindness.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees, but corrected the figure after consulting with a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area, and beekeepers worked to recover the hives and ensure the bees returned to them. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the recovery efforts, and most bees were expected to be back in their hives by the following morning.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital flight to the edge of space from its West Texas launch site. The New Shepard rocket carried an international crew, including passengers from Panama, Canada, and New Zealand, to an altitude of nearly 65 miles, providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and views of space. The reusable booster returned to a landing pad near the launch site, while the capsule descended under parachutes for a soft landing in the desert. This marked Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight, bringing the total number of people launched by the company to 68.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, indicating they will seek amendments despite Israeli approval of the plan. The militant group aims for a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli military withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid flow. A senior Hamas official mentioned specific points of contention, including U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli forces' withdrawal.

          <p>The Hollywood film and television industry in California is facing growing concerns about its long-term viability, with a significant decline in production and job opportunities. Following the 2023 strikes, the industry has struggled to recover, with television production in Los Angeles decreasing by 58% since 2021. Productions are increasingly moving to other states and countries offering more attractive tax incentives, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to propose more than doubling the state's film and TV tax credits. However, some industry experts question whether this measure is sufficient to offset the high cost of working in California, as many in Hollywood are struggling to find work.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for key areas such as the NHS, defense, and education. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other unprotected areas. While funding increased in 2024 for various sectors, the IFS notes that spending will no longer increase year-on-year due to government commitments. The upcoming Spending Review on June 11 is expected to outline departmental budgets for the next few years, with concerns that some plans may not receive sufficient funding.</p>

          <p>The United States has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House, after a UN nuclear watchdog report indicated Iran has increased its enriched uranium production. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged receiving "elements of a US deal" from his Omani counterpart. The IAEA report highlighted Iran's possession of over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels, which prompted the US to send a "detailed and acceptable" proposal, though precise details remain unclear. Iran insists its program is peaceful, while the US emphasizes that Iran must never obtain a nuclear bomb.</p>

          <p>According to Ross Douthat, Donald Trump's political resilience stems from his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This adaptability reassures swing voters that any extreme actions are provisional and that Trump is generally willing to pull back. Recent shifts in Trump's policies, such as easing China tariffs and distancing from Elon Musk, have improved his poll numbers. This suggests that voters expect Trump to check himself and be checked by others, approving of his pressure on institutions they distrust, contingent on his acceptance of counterpressure.</p>
