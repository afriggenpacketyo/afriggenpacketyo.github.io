          <p>Oleksandr Usyk solidified his status in boxing history by defeating Daniel Dubois via a fifth-round stoppage at Wembley Stadium, reclaiming the undisputed heavyweight title. The 38-year-old Ukrainian fighter delivered a masterful performance, knocking Dubois down twice in the decisive round to extend his professional record to 24-0. This victory reunifies the heavyweight division's major belts under Usyk, as he regained the IBF title that was previously stripped from him, adding it to his WBA, WBO, and WBC championships.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler holds a significant lead heading into the final round of The Open at Royal Portrush, positioning himself to potentially win his third major. After a strong third round, he sits at 14-under par, with his closest competitor four strokes behind. A victory would place Scheffler three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam and make him one of only four players to win the Masters, PGA Championship, and The Open before turning 30. Other contenders like Rory McIlroy and Matt Fitzpatrick trail further behind.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges from water companies by half by the year 2030. This pledge follows significant public outrage over waterway pollution and data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes measures to ban wet wipes containing plastic and cut phosphorus pollution from treated wastewater. The announcement comes as consumer water bills are expected to rise to fund a record £104 billion investment in infrastructure improvements.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across the country, indicating a risk of flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruptions. The alerts follow a recent heatwave that has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the likelihood of flooding. While an earlier amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared intense downpours, warnings remain active for Scotland, Wales, and much of England through the weekend and into Monday.</p>

          <p>Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing sanctions on a Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The Trump administration placed visa restrictions on Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, calling the case a "political witch hunt." Lula described the sanctions as unacceptable interference in Brazil's justice system and a violation of national sovereignty. The move follows a ruling requiring Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor while he awaits a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protests took place in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, and other cities, with many arrests made for displaying placards in support of the group. The UK government banned Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act earlier this month, making support for the group a criminal offense.

          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open, calling the pace "out of control." Both golfers were warned by officials during the third round for their groups' timing, which they found inconsistent with the slower pace allowed during the first two days of the tournament. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness. The criticism follows a controversial slow-play penalty issued to another golfer earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians near food distribution centers in southern Gaza, killing 32 people and wounding dozens, according to hospital officials and witnesses. The incidents occurred near hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US- and Israeli-backed group. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after suspects approached its forces and ignored calls to stop, and it is investigating reports of casualties. Hundreds have been killed near these sites in recent months amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

This barrage is part of an intensified bombing campaign by Russia, which is increasingly using large numbers of drones in its attacks.

          <p>The Christian youth organization Generation Life is engaging with young people on the Jersey shore, promoting a message of "chastity before marriage" in a setting known for hedonism. The group's Gen Z activists attempt to connect with peers by discussing modern relationship challenges, such as the negative impacts of social media, before introducing their views on chastity. This article explores how the organization adapts its traditionally religious message for a generation that is increasingly secular, risk-averse, and navigating a complex digital dating landscape, framing abstinence as a "countercultural" act of self-worth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of Japan's upcoming upper house election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Nationalist groups like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing rhetoric similar to Western far-right movements, focusing on issues like unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners. While defenders of immigration point to Japan's severe labor shortages, these parties advocate for stricter controls and reject reliance on foreign workers, a position that resonates with some voters concerned about economic issues and cultural norms.
