          <p>The American Federation of Teachers is partnering with tech giants Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI to launch a $23 million AI training academy for educators. The initiative aims to help teachers harness artificial intelligence safely and ethically in the classroom, rather than being replaced by it. Starting this fall, the academy will offer free virtual training to the union's 1.8 million members, with the goal of training 400,000 educators in person over five years. This collaboration seeks to keep teachers in control of how AI is implemented in schools, enhancing learning while addressing concerns about the technology.</p>

          <p>An internal State Department cable reveals that an "unknown actor" used artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The impersonator created a Signal account and contacted at least five high-level officials, including three foreign ministers, a U.S. governor, and a member of Congress. The actor used AI-generated text and voice messages, likely aiming to manipulate the targets to gain access to sensitive information. The State Department has confirmed it is investigating the incident and taking steps to improve cybersecurity against such emerging threats.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has introduced a National Farm Security Action Plan aimed at preventing foreign adversaries, particularly China, from controlling American agricultural resources. The plan proposes legislative and executive actions to ban Chinese nationals from buying U.S. farmland and to assess land ownership near military bases. Top administration officials, including the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, framed the initiative as a crucial national security measure to prevent agricultural assets from being "weaponized" against the United States.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old man has been arrested and charged with attempted kidnapping and assault after allegedly snatching a 6-year-old boy from a crowded sidewalk in Coney Island. The boy's father stated that he and the boy's mother saw the man pick up their son and run, at which point they gave chase. The suspect then threw the child to the ground before the parents were able to pin him down until police arrived. The boy was not seriously injured in the frightening incident, and the investigation remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire, sparked by a car fire, has reached the northern edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, leading to what the mayor described as "guerrilla warfare" by firefighters. The blaze has forced the closure of Marseille Provence airport, and residents have been urged to stay indoors as emergency services battle the flames. The fire has covered approximately 700 hectares, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions, with officials describing the scene as "apocalyptic." This event occurs as other parts of Europe, including Spain and Greece, also contend with significant wildfires.</p>

          <p>A recently signed budget bill introduces "Trump accounts," a new type of government-seeded investment vehicle for children. Under the provision, U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028 will be eligible for an account seeded with a $1,000 government contribution. Parents and employers can make additional annual contributions. While financial experts call the initial grant a "no-brainer," they advise families to compare the accounts' tax implications with those of existing vehicles like 529 plans and Roth IRAs for specific long-term goals.

          <p>A Guardian columnist criticizes the U.S. justice system following a Justice Department memo that found no evidence of an Epstein "client list" or basis for investigating other individuals. The author argues that while Ghislaine Maxwell is imprisoned, the vast network of powerful people who enabled Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation has largely escaped accountability. The piece condemns what it calls a two-tier justice system where the wealthy and influential are protected, leaving countless victims without full justice.</p>

          <p>Melissa Turner has been convicted of second-degree murder in the 2019 stabbing death of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler, largely due to audio evidence from a neighbor's security camera. Turner claimed she acted in self-defense during a physical argument, but the camera captured audio of her screaming phrases like "So f****** die." This recording, combined with footage from a camera inside the couple's home, contradicted her account and was pivotal in the jury's decision to find her guilty. She was sentenced to 20.5 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, has dismissed concerns that President Trump's tariffs will lead to significant price increases, likening the odds to rare events such as "pandemics or meteors." He argued that there is currently no evidence of broad inflation resulting from the trade policies. However, many economists contend that price hikes are still likely, attributing the current stability to implementation delays, the time lag between policy and market impact, and proactive stockpiling by companies.

It makes urgent recommendations to reform the compensation process, which it criticizes as being slow and "unnecessarily adversarial," and calls for free legal advice for claimants.</p>
