          <p>John Woeltz, a 37-year-old cryptocurrency investor, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and torturing a 28-year-old Italian tourist in a Manhattan townhouse. The victim was allegedly held captive for three weeks and subjected to beatings, electric shocks, and threats in an attempt to force him to reveal his Bitcoin password.  Another individual, Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested in connection with the case, though she was later released pending further investigation.  The article details the victim's escape and the subsequent police investigation, which uncovered evidence of the sexual assault and torture.

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius indicated that compulsory military service could be reintroduced if voluntary enlistment fails to meet the country's defense needs. The new military service model will initially rely on volunteers, but the government is preparing legislation to allow for mandatory recruitment as early as 2026. This debate intensifies amid rising concerns about Germany's national defense readiness and the evolving security landscape in Europe, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany suspended its draft in 2011 but has since struggled to meet troop targets, making the potential reinstatement a significant policy shift.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The images were obtained using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The USS F-1 collided with another submarine during training exercises and remained lost for nearly 60 years until its rediscovery in 1972. The new images provide a detailed look at the submarine's wreckage, allowing for the creation of 3-D models and honoring the legacy of the lost sailors.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, conceived and largely developed by Israelis, is set to be implemented by foreign contractors, displacing experienced aid agencies like the United Nations. The plan, initially proposed by Israeli officials in late 2023, aims to undermine Hamas's control and bypass the UN, which Israeli officials accuse of anti-Israeli bias. The initiative involves private organizations, including one run by a former C.I.A. officer, to secure distribution sites in Israeli-controlled areas.  The UN has warned that this plan could restrict aid to limited parts of Gaza and potentially displace civilians.</p>

The messages warn drivers of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threaten steep penalties, including additional fines and suspension of driving privileges if the reader does not comply. These phishing scams by text, otherwise known as "smishing," or SMS phishing, have been on the rise in recent months.

As the solution tracks downslope, it gathers rare earth elements, which are then collected in large ponds.
