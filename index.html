          <p>President Trump's military parade is the first major event of its kind in Washington D.C. in over three decades.  Past military parades typically celebrated war victories or troop returns, with examples dating back to the Civil War and World War II.  The event's cost and its association with authoritarian regimes have drawn criticism.  The rarity of such parades in the US reflects a cultural suspicion of concentrated state and military power.</p>
