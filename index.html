          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its cautious approach while evaluating the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and improvements in business and consumer sentiment. However, he cautioned that the Trump administration's tariffs are likely to increase inflation and slow economic growth this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury found Karen Read not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, after a retrial. She was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene after an accident resulting in death, but was found guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, receiving a one-year probation sentence. The prosecution argued Read hit O'Keefe with her car and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense claimed O'Keefe was attacked by others and left outside. Following the verdict, supporters celebrated outside the courthouse, while some witnesses expressed disappointment.</p>

The list includes iconic films such as "Star Wars," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," "Jurassic Park," and "The Lion King." The compilation of summer's biggest hits from 1975 to 2024 have earned over $15 billion, unadjusted for inflation. The list also notes that box office tracking prior to 1981 was less reliable, and the summer of 2020 saw virtually no box office due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

          <p>Destroying Iran's nuclear program is a difficult task due to the fortified nature of facilities like the Fordo plant, which is built inside a mountain. The U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a "bunker buster" weapon capable of penetrating such sites, along with the B2 Spirit stealth bomber needed to deploy it. However, experts say multiple bombing rounds may be necessary, and there's no guarantee of completely destroying the facility. A U.S. strike could also provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, potentially escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>Tyler Perry is facing a $260 million lawsuit from an actor who alleges a pattern of sexual harassment, assault, and retaliation.

Perry's attorney denies the allegations, calling them fabricated and a setup for a scam. The lawsuit details alleged incidents of unwanted advances, suggestive comments, and groping over several years, as well as retaliation after Dixon distanced himself from Perry.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, the U.S. is considering direct military involvement, potentially using "bunker buster" bombs. These bombs are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding, with the GBU-57 MOP being the most powerful non-nuclear option. Only the U.S. possesses both the GBU-57 and the B-2 stealth bomber required to deploy it. Experts say the GBU-57 could cause significant damage to facilities like Fordo, but it might not completely halt Iran's nuclear program.</p>
