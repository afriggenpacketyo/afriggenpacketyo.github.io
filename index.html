          <p>The Hang Seng Tech index in Hong Kong experienced an 11% decline since its March high, entering correction territory.  Profit-taking, trade war uncertainty, and US restrictions on Chinese tech contributed to the downturn. While some analysts view the correction as normal after a strong rally and remain positive on China's tech sector, others express caution, citing potential for further volatility due to US tariffs and China's economic recovery.</p>
