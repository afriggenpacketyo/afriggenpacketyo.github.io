          <p>Volkswagen has announced the upcoming closure of a car factory in Nanjing, China, which it operates as a joint venture with its local partner SAIC. The plant, which produced models like the Volkswagen Passat and Skoda Superb, is being shuttered as the company accelerates its strategic transformation toward electric vehicle production. An urban location that complicates the necessary expansion for modern EV manufacturing was cited by the company as a key reason for the closure.</p>

The prestigious UNESCO listing is expected to further boost tourism and represents the culmination of a quarter-century of dedicated effort by Bavarian politicians to secure the recognition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that goods imported from the European Union and Mexico will be subject to a 30% tariff beginning August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, he cited the persistent trade deficit with the EU and insufficient border control by Mexico as the primary reasons for the new duties. Trump also warned that he would impose even higher taxes if either trading partner chose to retaliate against the measures. The move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has also targeted other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has significantly intensified its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, targeting cities like Kyiv and Odessa with hundreds of projectiles in combined assaults. Military experts suggest this escalation aims to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, destroy the country's military-industrial complex, and demoralize the civilian population through terror. The analysis highlights Russia's increased domestic drone production, which has reduced its reliance on foreign suppliers like Iran and is a key factor enabling these massive, sustained strikes.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: End of Mandatory Shoe Removal at Airports Signals Shift from Post-9/11 Security Theater</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent move away from mandatory shoe removal at U.S. airport security checkpoints represents a significant and positive shift away from the "security theater" that has defined travel in the post-9/11 era. The author contends that for over two decades, many security measures were more about creating a perception of safety than providing effective, risk-based protection. This change suggests a welcome evolution towards more intelligent and less burdensome security protocols for the traveling public.</p>

          <p>A boom in unregulated rare earth mining in Myanmar's Shan state is causing a severe cross-border environmental disaster, heavily polluting rivers that flow into Thailand. Activists and officials report dangerously high levels of arsenic and other hazardous metals in the Kok and Sai rivers, which are vital water sources for Thai communities and ultimately feed into the Mekong. The mining operations are largely controlled by an ethnic militia, with China being the primary importer of the critical minerals.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams are in their eighth day of searching for more than 170 people who remain missing after catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas. The death toll from the July 4 storm has climbed to at least 122, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River swelled to unprecedented levels. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, enabling FEMA to support the massive local and state search and recovery operations in the flood-ravaged region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to diplomatic sources, President Trump is considering approving new funding for Ukraine, a potential policy shift from his previous criticisms of aid levels. The move may be a response to Russia's recent intensified aerial assaults, with Trump expressing disappointment with Vladimir Putin and stating he has approved sending more defensive weapons. The potential funding could come from leftover presidential drawdown authority or from the $5 billion in seized Russian assets that the president has the authority to direct to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, stated that the Labour Party is failing to defend working people, causing them to turn away "in droves." The criticism comes after Unite voted to potentially rethink its relationship with the party, which could lead to a formal cut in ties and its substantial funding of over £1 million annually. The immediate trigger for the dispute was the union's suspension of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her handling of bin strikes in Birmingham.</p>
