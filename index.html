          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit seeking to remove 13 Democratic state representatives from office. The lawmakers fled the state to prevent a quorum, thereby blocking a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan. The plan would likely increase the number of Republican-held congressional seats. This legal and political standoff continues with Democrats vowing to stay away until the special session ends, while state Republicans have threatened arrests and suspended direct deposit paychecks to compel their return.</p>

          <p>Billy Long has left his position as the commissioner of the IRS just two months after his Senate confirmation. The departure adds to the leadership instability at the tax agency, which has seen several interim heads under the current administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily lead the agency, and President Trump is expected to nominate Long, a former Republican congressman, for an ambassadorship. The move comes as the IRS faces significant workforce reductions and internal disputes over its direction and data privacy.</p>

          <p>An ethics watchdog group, the Democracy Defenders Fund, has formally requested a federal investigation into the Department of Defense's acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar's royal family on behalf of President Trump. The group alleges that accepting the $400 million "gift" and using nearly a billion dollars in diverted defense funds to retrofit it may violate federal laws and represents a significant abuse of public trust. The request questions the necessity of the aircraft, as the Air Force One fleet already has replacements in production.</p>

          <p>Houston Texans player Jimmie Ward was arrested and jailed for the second time in two months after violating the conditions of his bond. The violation reportedly occurred when he tested positive for alcohol, which was prohibited under the terms of his release following a June arrest for felony assault. His attorney stated that Ward believed the condition was to avoid intoxication, not complete abstinence from alcohol, and clarified that no new allegations or contact with the complainant had occurred. Ward was originally charged with assault on a family member.</p>

          <p>Salad chain Sweetgreen saw its stock price drop by 23% after it reduced its full-year financial forecast for the second consecutive quarter. The company attributed the downgrade to several challenges, including a difficult transition to a new loyalty program, weaker consumer spending, and the impact of tariffs. Sweetgreen now anticipates negative same-store sales for the year and a lower restaurant-level profit margin. CEO Jonathan Neman described the recent period as a "really, really rough quarter," citing both internal operational issues and external economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Citing author Kelly Corrigan, it suggests that simple activities like a three-minute dance break or walking during phone calls can effectively reset one's mood and mental state. Rather than forcing productivity during low-energy periods, the piece advocates for working with the body's natural rhythms. The key insight is that these physical breaks are not a distraction but an integral part of creative and intellectual work.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has firmly rejected international criticism following its security cabinet's approval of a plan to take full military control of Gaza City. The move, part of a broader strategy to disarm Hamas and demilitarize the territory, has drawn condemnation from the UN, UK, France, and others, with Germany halting military exports to Israel. Israeli officials remain defiant, stating that external pressure will not deter their objectives. The plan would involve displacing over a million residents, escalating a conflict that has already created a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's implementation of new, sweeping tariffs is raising concerns among some economists about the potential for stagflation—a combination of high inflation and low economic growth. The new import duties have pushed the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest point since 1934, which could lead businesses to pass on costs to consumers, fueling inflation. Simultaneously, these costs could cause businesses to scale back on hiring and investment, slowing down the economy. While the White House dismissed these fears, recent data shows a wobbling job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson has been left out of the team's squad after reaching a mutual agreement with the club that he can leave during the current transfer window. The 24-year-old Senegal international is reportedly attracting interest from Newcastle. Chelsea, having already signed two new strikers, hopes to receive a transfer fee significantly higher than the £32 million they paid for him in 2023. If the club's asking price is not met, the plan is to reintegrate Jackson back into the squad.</p>

The new UC president stated that such a payment would "completely devastate" the public university system.

The individuals were identified as Ryan D. Fitzgerald, Barbara A. Keating, and another woman whose family requested privacy. The identifications were made possible by advances in DNA testing technology applied to remains recovered from the World Trade Center site. This ongoing effort by the city's medical examiner's office provides long-awaited answers to families, though around 1,100 victims remain unidentified.</p>

          <p>An analysis reflects on the state of Belarus five years after the historic 2020 protests against the rigged presidential election. Despite the massive uprising, President Alexander Lukashenko has solidified his power, largely with Russia's support, and the regime has systematically erased traces of the dissent. Thousands have been prosecuted for political reasons, and prominent opposition figures remain imprisoned with little to no contact. Experts note that while the West had little leverage to effect change at the time, it could still negotiate for the release of political prisoners.</p>
