          <p>Two Minnesota state lawmakers, State Senator John Hoffman and State Representative Melissa Hortman, were shot in what authorities believe were targeted attacks at their homes early Saturday morning. The shootings occurred in Champlin and Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, which are located about eight miles apart, just north of Minneapolis. Authorities suspect the shooter may have been impersonating law enforcement during the attacks. Governor Tim Walz has activated the State Emergency Operations Center and is working with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement to investigate the situation and provide updates as they become available. </p>

Massachusetts is the most expensive state, requiring over $300,000 annually, while Mississippi is the most affordable, needing at least $186,618. The study utilized MIT's living wage calculator to estimate essential costs, including housing, food, and childcare. The report indicates that costs of living grew in most states, with some experiencing double-digit growth rates. </p>

          <p>Parenting influencer Becky Kennedy challenges the predominantly negative narratives surrounding men and masculinity, asserting that many modern fathers are actively engaged and making positive contributions. She emphasizes that fathers are seeking connection and a "dad journey," not just "dad duty," and are increasingly involved in caregiving and emotional support. Kennedy's "sturdy parenting" approach encourages a balanced perspective, rejecting the expectation that men must become mothers while acknowledging their desire to improve their domestic lives. Kennedy's perspective offers positive reinforcement for fathers striving to be better parents. </p>

          <p>The upcoming live-action remake of "How to Train Your Dragon" aims to preserve the essence of Toothless, the beloved dragon, while creating a photorealistic version. Visual effects supervisor Christian Manz and his team at Framestore focused on maintaining Toothless' expressive face and eyes to retain his personality. Director Dean DeBlois emphasized that the goal was to create a version that lives alongside the animated films, not to replace them. The design changes, while subtle, include a larger size and smaller head and eyes to blend into a photorealistic world. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has left a notable imprint on Washington, despite his departure from the Trump administration. DOGE eliminated approximately 260,000 federal employee jobs and significantly reduced funding for scientific research and humanitarian aid. While DOGE claims to have saved the government $180 billion, this falls short of its ambitious $2 trillion target, and efforts are underway to rehire some of the laid-off workers. Elaine Kamarck from the Brookings Institution suggests that DOGE's tactics may have long-term negative consequences due to the insertion of chaos and fear into the federal workforce. </p>
