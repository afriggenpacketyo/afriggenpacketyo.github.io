          <p>President Trump has invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to place the city's police force under direct federal control and deployed the National Guard to combat what he described as rampant crime. This move comes despite local police data showing a significant decline in violent crime over the last year and a half. The president dismissed the official statistics and declared a public safety emergency, citing high-profile incidents as justification for the federal intervention. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the action "unsettling and unprecedented" but stated the city would comply with the law.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced the termination of its iconic dial-up internet service, effective September 30th, after more than 35 years of operation. The company, now owned by Yahoo, stated the decision was part of its routine evaluation of products to meet the demands of the modern digital landscape. While the service is now used by a very small number of households, its distinctive connection sound and "You've Got Mail" greeting are remembered as hallmarks of the early internet era. Free AOL email accounts and other services will not be affected by this change.</p>

          <p>Sportswear giant Adidas has issued a public apology following accusations of cultural appropriation for its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe design. The shoe was inspired by traditional "huarache" sandals from the Indigenous Yalalag community in Oaxaca, Mexico, who were not involved in the product's creation. The issue drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Oaxaca's governor, who highlighted the importance of protecting Indigenous intellectual property under a 2022 law. The shoe's designer also expressed deep regret, stating the intention was to honor, not appropriate, Oaxacan culture.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to extend the existing tariff truce with China for an additional 90 days, averting an immediate escalation in the trade dispute. The decision provides temporary relief and more time for negotiators, following recent talks in Stockholm. Just before the announcement, the president publicly urged China to significantly increase its purchases of American soybeans, framing it as a way to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. This extension comes amid ongoing fragility in trade relations between the two economic powers.</p>

The announcement has been met with caution from Ukraine, which insists any agreement must have Kyiv's involvement.</p>

          <p>An unusual agreement requires Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Analysts view this as a transactional approach by the Trump administration, effectively creating an "indirect tariff at source." From an investor standpoint, the deal is seen as a net positive, as securing 85% of revenue from the vast Chinese market is preferable to being completely shut out. The move gives the companies short-term certainty but raises long-term questions about whether the government might seek a larger share in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that his administration is actively considering reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a less restrictive drug category, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. This announcement follows reports that the president was weighing the move, causing a significant rally in cannabis stocks, many of which are currently penny stocks. Reclassification, likely to Schedule III, would ease tax burdens on marijuana companies and encourage institutional investment. While the president's support is crucial, the final authority rests with the Attorney General and the DEA. (not investment advice)</p>

Bayless asserted that the teams who passed on Sanders, allowing him to be drafted in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns, were made to look like "racist fools" and "petty fools." He argued that Sanders' fall in the draft was a deliberate attempt by the league to "teach a lesson" to the quarterback and his father, Deion Sanders.

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials related to the Ghislaine Maxwell case, ruling that their release would not provide meaningful new information. Judge Paul Engelmayer stated that the government's premise was "demonstrably false," as the records do not identify new individuals, crimes, or investigative paths beyond what is already public. He suggested the motion could be perceived as a diversionary tactic rather than a genuine effort at transparency. The Justice Department had argued for the release based on special circumstances, a claim the judge firmly rejected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of enterprise AI firm C3 AI dropped more than 20% after it released disappointing preliminary first-quarter revenue estimates and announced a sales organization restructuring. CEO Thomas Siebel labeled the sales results "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor performance to the disruptive reorganization and his own ongoing health issues, which limited his active role in sales. The company projects revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant decrease from the $87.2 million reported in the same quarter last year. Siebel expressed confidence that the company is now positioned to accelerate its growth going forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, causing its stock to rise. The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, or one cent per share, compared to a $32.8 million loss a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering industry-wide box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company also successfully refinanced its near-term debt, providing a more solid foundation to capitalize on what it believes will be continued growth in the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that seniors facing financial pressure from inflation and high living costs may want to consider a reverse mortgage to supplement their income. The tool is presented as particularly beneficial for those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash, or for those who wish to age in place and need funds for home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to borrow against their home's value without making monthly payments, providing tax-free funds. However, it is a significant financial decision that carries risks and is not suitable for every homeowner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major heat wave is affecting large parts of Europe, with temperatures exceeding 109°F (43°C) and fueling destructive wildfires in several countries, including France, Montenegro, and Turkey.

          <p>The United Nations human rights office has condemned a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed six journalists, including five from Al Jazeera, calling it a grave breach of international law. Israel's military claimed it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim he had denied and for which Israel has provided little evidence. The attack has drawn outrage from media rights groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders. The killings bring the number of journalists killed in the conflict since October 2023 to at least 186.</p>

The most common types of fraud include credit card theft, online shopping scams, and ransomware attacks, with 24% of respondents admitting they were tricked into giving away personal information. Cybersecurity experts warn of increasingly sophisticated methods, such as phishing attacks through unsolicited calendar invites and multi-factor authentication "fatigue" attacks. They advise users to be vigilant, change calendar settings, and use authentication apps that provide codes rather than simple approval prompts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to hear a Louisiana redistricting case is not an attack on the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but rather a challenge to racial gerrymandering. The author contends that drawing congressional districts to ensure the election of a representative of a specific race is a form of affirmative action that defies the color-blind language of the original law. The piece suggests that this practice has sometimes hurt the Democratic party by "packing" minority voters into a few safe districts. The author concludes that ending this practice would align with the act's original intent.</p>
