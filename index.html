The judge ruled that the FOMC is not a government agency under the act's purview and questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made with her late associate, Jeffrey Epstein, should have protected her from being charged. This appeal comes as Maxwell is reportedly in discussions with the Justice Department about potentially cooperating with the government. The central legal question is whether the Florida-based plea deal for Epstein extended immunity to his alleged co-conspirators in other federal districts.</p>

Prosecutors allege Craig poisoned his wife's protein shakes and administered a fatal dose of cyanide while she was hospitalized in March 2023. The defense did not call any witnesses but has suggested Angela Craig, who was described as having a "broken heart" over her husband's infidelity, may have taken her own life. Investigators found a document on Craig's phone where he claimed his wife asked him to help her die.</p>

          <p>A significant federal incentive for electric vehicle buyers is set to end, with the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones expiring on September 30. The termination of the credits, a reversal of previous climate policy, is expected to impact EV sales, which have already seen slowing growth. Auto dealers and manufacturers anticipate a short-term surge in sales as consumers rush to take advantage of the savings before the deadline. The change affects a wide range of electric and plug-in hybrid models, a crucial market in states like California.</p>

          <p>A federal trade court has declined to immediately block the Trump administration's decision to eliminate the 'de minimis' tariff exemption for low-value imports. The ruling came in a case brought by auto parts retailer Detroit Axle, which argued that ending the duty-free status for shipments under $800 threatens its business model. The court stayed the case, noting that the relief sought is already covered by a broader, ongoing legal challenge to the administration's tariffs. The decision keeps the new tariff rules in place pending the outcome of an appeal.</p>

According to an internal memo, the vast majority of these data pulls, or API calls, are not initiated by customers for active transactions but for other purposes like data harvesting. The bank, which is preparing to charge these firms for data access, claims the high volume increases costs and is linked to higher rates of fraud, signaling a potential shift in the "open banking" ecosystem.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirees to determine a safe annual withdrawal rate from their savings. The rule suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio in the first year of retirement, then adjusting for inflation annually, to make savings last approximately 30 years. When applied to annuities, the rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. The article explores how this comparison helps retirees evaluate trade-offs between liquidity, inflation protection, and longevity risk. (not investment advice)</p>
