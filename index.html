          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. significantly increased, while those from China decreased, reflecting Apple's adaptation to tariffs. According to Omdia, shipments from India reached roughly 3,000,000 in April, surpassing China's 900,000. While this growth demonstrates the adaptability of Apple's supply chains, analysts expect it to plateau as India's manufacturing capacity needs to expand to meet U.S. demand; Trump has also threatened tariffs on iPhones made in India. The article suggests Apple is playing a "dangerous game" as it navigates trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles addressed Canada's Parliament, a rare move amid trade disputes and annexation threats from President Trump, in what is viewed as a sign of solidarity. The King delivered a "Speech from the Throne," outlining the government's agenda after the Liberal Party's election victory, with the speech written by Prime Minister Carney's office. Experts suggest the visit is a reminder of Canada's independence and a rallying point for Canadians, especially given Trump's comments on annexing Canada. Carney has criticized Trump's gestures and affirmed Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A Catalist report analyzes the 2024 election results, revealing key shifts in voter demographics and their implications for Democratic strategy. The report indicates that Democrats' loss wasn't due to weak turnout from the progressive base, but rather a rightward shift among young and nonwhite voters. Younger voters were significantly more Republican in 2024 than in 2020, driven by a rightward drift of young men, while nonwhite voters, particularly young Black and Latino men, also showed decreased support for the Democratic nominee. The article underscores the need for Democrats to address the rightward shift of these key demographics.</p>

          <p>In Nashville, volunteers are organizing to counter ICE actions and document what they see as an unprecedented partnership between state troopers and ICE agents. The ReMIX Tennessee, an immigrant advocacy organization, is using a hotline and social media to warn community members of ICE activity. They say the actions are creating fear in the Hispanic community and that the documentation is preventing the problem from getting worse.</p>

          <p>North Korea has criticized the US plan for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, saying it risks turning outer space into a nuclear war field.

          <p>Garment manufacturers in China and Vietnam are cautious despite President Trump's statement that the U.S. is not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts. The statement came after weeks of fluctuating tariff policies, leaving exporters uncertain about the future. Businesses are still navigating a 90-day pause in tariffs and seeking a deal with Washington to prevent further duty increases.</p>
