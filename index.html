            <p>The UK will provide Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of military drones as part of a £450m aid package to bolster its war effort against Russia. The support includes funding for drone technology, vehicle repairs, and radar systems, aiming to strengthen Ukraine's defenses. This commitment underscores the UK's ongoing support for Ukraine and its efforts to deter Russian aggression. The delay in US-brokered peace talks has raised questions about the practical progress being made by the coalition of the willing.</p>

            <p>A tattoo belonging to a British man from Derbyshire has been incorrectly linked to a Venezuelan gang in a US government document. The tattoo, a clock face with his daughter's birth date and time, appeared in a Department of Homeland Security document used to identify members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organization, despite the man having no connection to the group. The man is worried that the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up "being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo".</p>
