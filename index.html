          <p>An early morning fire and subsequent explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood caused the collapse of three rowhome buildings and damaged adjacent structures. At least two elderly women were hospitalized, with one reported in critical condition, prompting the evacuation of some nearby residents as a precautionary measure. A large-scale, multi-agency investigation involving fire, police, and federal officials is underway to determine the cause of the incident. The operation is expected to be extensive as crews meticulously search the rubble for any other potential victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to prevent a major rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and stated the government is now in a "better position" after strengthening the plans in response to concerns about potential harm to disabled individuals. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. This U-turn has seemingly appeased most rebels, securing the bill's likely passage.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Air Force has reported that Russia launched its most extensive aerial assault to date, utilizing 537 drones and missiles to target cities across the country. While 249 projectiles were intercepted, the attacks hit civilian infrastructure and injured several people, including a child. Tragically, a decorated Ukrainian F-16 pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Ustymenko, was killed in action after shooting down seven Russian targets before his own aircraft was damaged. President Zelenskyy condemned the escalating aggression, noting over 1,270 drones and 114 missiles were launched in the past week alone amid stalled ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision that allows the Trump administration to proceed with its executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the change means the policy could take effect in as little as 30 days in the 28 states that have not filed legal challenges. Opponents will continue to fight the order on its merits, and new class-action lawsuits are being filed to protect noncitizen pregnant women. The administration has yet to provide clear details on how such a radical policy shift would be implemented.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Republican leaders are seizing the opportunity to portray the Democratic party as extremist. Key GOP figures, including Donald Trump, are labeling the 33-year-old Democratic socialist a "communist" to energize their base and attack Democrats on a national scale. While some progressive Democrats have celebrated the win, moderate party members have been more hesitant, creating an internal divide. In response to criticism and what some call Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani has emphasized his focus on city issues like affordability and combating antisemitism.</p>

          <p>England international striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin has confirmed he is leaving Everton Football Club after nine years. The 28-year-old, whose contract expires on Monday, announced his departure on social media, calling it an "incredibly difficult decision." Calvert-Lewin joined the club in 2016 from Sheffield United and went on to score 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees. In his statement, he expressed deep gratitude to the club, its staff, and his teammates, acknowledging Everton as the place that shaped him as both a player and a person.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to advance a major piece of Republican legislation, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a prolonged and tense session. The procedural vote succeeded after a bloc of four conservative holdouts flipped their votes following intense negotiations with GOP leadership over deficit reduction and Medicaid changes. President Trump celebrated the outcome, praising the senators for their work. Despite this advancement, the final passage of the roughly 1,000-page bill is not guaranteed, as some senators who voted to proceed remain non-committal on the final version. Democrats have initiated a request to have the entire bill read aloud, a tactic that could take over 15 hours.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is aggressively using Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to investigate and pressure universities, a tactic previously associated with Democratic administrations' use of Title IX. These investigations target alleged discrimination, including anti-Semitism and DEI programs, with threats of freezing federal funds or banning foreign students. Critics argue this is a pretext to intimidate higher education, while supporters claim it's a necessary enforcement of the law. This approach has forced institutions like Columbia and Harvard to face demands that critics say infringe on academic freedom and institutional autonomy, creating a new front in the culture wars over higher education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z and millennials. Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon argues this trend is a symptom of a "poor-impulse-control economy," driven by stagnant real wages, high living costs, and the normalization of debt. While these services offer interest-free payment plans, they also encourage spending on non-essential items and are leading to rising consumer loan losses. For many young people, BNPL is seen less as irresponsible and more as a tool for navigating an economy where traditional financial stability feels unattainable.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for the Gulf coast of Mexico as Tropical Depression Two gathers strength. The system is moving west-northwest and is expected to make landfall Sunday night, bringing heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated totals up to 10 inches. This rainfall poses a significant risk of life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in mountainous regions. Meanwhile, the Atlantic basin remains quiet with no immediate threats to Florida, partly due to a large plume of Saharan dust.

This development raises concerns about the foundation upon which policymakers, businesses, and investors make critical decisions.

The newspaper claimed that Freeman, while working as a paid advisor for environmental monitoring firm GHGSat, solicited help from the company to draft parliamentary questions for government ministers. This action potentially violates guidance from an appointments watchdog, which had previously advised him not to lobby the government on the firm's behalf due to his former role as science minister.

          <p>In an introspective essay, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) grapples with the challenge of resisting despair in a political climate she describes as authoritarian and suffocating. She advocates for holding onto opposing thoughts simultaneously: acknowledging horror while committing to action, and feeling rage while channeling it into purpose. The author points to the community-building power of protests and draws inspiration from activists like those at the City of Joy in Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, who organized grassroots aid. The essay concludes that in the face of failing systems, every act of care, love, and community building is a form of resistance and a step toward creating a new world.</p>

          <p>A Catholic school in the New Orleans area has dismissed a music teacher of 21 years after a parent discovered from his late husband's obituary that he was in a same-sex marriage. The teacher, Mark Richards, stated he was terminated due to his sexual orientation, which the school's employment contract prohibits as a violation of its morality clause. The decision has prompted significant backlash from other parents, who have organized a petition calling the firing unjust and praising the teacher's long service.

Legal experts note this consolidation of power could lead to legal challenges and further erode public trust in the institution.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Far From Home," moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska provides a candid look at her political career, including her contentious relationship with Donald Trump and her dismay over the Supreme Court's direction. She recounts voting to convict Trump in his second impeachment and his subsequent failed attempt to unseat her. Murkowski also reveals her pro-choice stance and accuses Justice Brett Kavanaugh of acting in bad faith by overturning Roe v. Wade after emphasizing the importance of precedent during his confirmation. The memoir offers a rare glimpse into the mindset of one of the few remaining centrists in a deeply polarized Republican party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The lone star tick, known for causing a severe red meat allergy called alpha-gal syndrome, is rapidly expanding its territory across the eastern U.S. due to rising temperatures from the climate crisis. Experts warn that the population of these aggressive ticks is seeing an "explosive increase," potentially spreading the allergy to millions of people. Cases of alpha-gal have surged from a few dozen in 2009 to a potential high of 450,000 today, and the number is expected to grow as the ticks move into previously colder regions. The condition causes delayed but severe allergic reactions to mammal products, forcing those affected to drastically alter their diets and lifestyles.</p>

          <p>A group of recently fired federal workers, part of a wave of over 59,000 let go since the Trump administration began thinning the federal workforce, are consistently lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Dubbed the "Tuesday Group," they seek to share their stories and advocate for assistance but are often met with indifference or outright rejection, particularly from Republican legislators. Despite their persistence, many lawmakers, including Senator Susan Collins, have avoided engaging with them. The workers, some of whom were with agencies like USAID and the EPA, describe the experience as frustrating but feel it is important to make their presence known and show the human cost of the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>A growing trend among Gen Z patrons to close their tab after every single drink is causing frustration for bartenders, according to a recent report. While some young customers see it as a method for responsible spending and monitoring alcohol consumption, those behind the bar find the practice disruptive and time-consuming, especially during busy periods. Each transaction requires a separate process, breaking the workflow of serving customers and preparing drinks. This habit also has a financial impact on establishments, as credit card swipe fees are incurred with every individual payment, accumulating costs for the business throughout the night.</p>

However, the stock has faced recent headwinds in 2025 due to sluggish sales, increased competition, and concerns over CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Musk now tells investors that the company's future value lies not in cars, but in solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

The article criticizes institutions like the University of California for perpetuating this erasure, even as they make gestures toward acknowledging Ohlone land.

          <p>An opinion piece harshly criticizes Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as head of the nation's health agencies, arguing he is lethally undermining public trust in vaccines. The author asserts that Kennedy, through his anti-vaccine rhetoric and actions like replacing the CDC's expert immunization committee with anti-vaccine activists, is responsible for eroding confidence in a cornerstone of public health. The article points to Kennedy's scientifically baseless claims about thimerosal, autism, and COVID-19 vaccines as evidence of his unsuitability for the role. The author concludes that Kennedy's actions are disastrous for public health both in the U.S. and globally, and will have deadly consequences.</p>

          <h2>Centennial of 1925 Santa Barbara Earthquake Offers Lessons for Modern Seismic Preparedness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts say the event holds crucial lessons for California's preparedness for the next "Big One." The 1925 quake, estimated at magnitude 6.5 to 6.8, exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address with mandatory retrofits. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a cohesive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style during its rebuild. Experts note that while progress has been made, many cities still lack ordinances for other at-risk structures, like soft-story apartment buildings, leaving them vulnerable today.</p>
