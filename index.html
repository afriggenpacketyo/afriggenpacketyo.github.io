          <p>In Formula 1, Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a tight qualifying session. He narrowly beat the McLaren team, with Oscar Piastri securing a career-best second place and his teammate Lando Norris finishing third. Verstappen noted that tricky, shifting wind conditions made the high-speed Silverstone circuit challenging, but his final lap was sufficient to top the time sheets ahead of the competitive McLarens.</p>

The protest was organized in support of Palestine Action, a direct-action group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. Following the ban, expressing support for the group is now a criminal offense, a move the government initiated after significant property damage was attributed to the group's activities.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Promotes '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat is promoting a '90-second rule' as a technique for better managing feelings of anger and stress. The rule is based on neuroscientific insight that the body's physiological stress response to a trigger, such as a surge in cortisol, only lasts for about 90 seconds. After that initial period, any prolonged negative emotion is the result of consciously or unconsciously replaying the thought, giving individuals a window to choose to refocus.</p>

          <p>A shop owner in Durham, UK, has voiced his frustration after a man who brazenly stole beer from his store received only a minor community resolution, which required him to pay for the stolen goods. The owner argues that this lack of meaningful punishment fails to deter crime and reflects a wider national problem where most reported shoplifting incidents do not result in charges. The case highlights the ongoing challenges faced by retailers and the public debate over effective crime prevention.</p>

          <p>Drawing inspiration from the Danish culture of happiness, a business school professor conducted a personal experiment by trying 17 different hobbies over the course of a single year. This journey, which included activities from woodworking to tennis, helped her overcome a doomscrolling habit, foster new social connections, and feel more confident and less lonely. The article makes the case that actively pursuing hobbies is a direct path to achieving work-life balance, rather than a reward for it.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the mixed verdict in Sean 'Diddy' Combs' federal trial exposes the legal system's inability to effectively address the complexities of domestic violence and coercive control. The author posits that prosecutors resorted to sex-trafficking charges because existing domestic violence laws are often outdated and ill-equipped to handle cases involving wealthy and powerful abusers. The piece concludes that the outcome represents a failure to secure true justice for survivors of intimate partner violence and highlights a need for legal reform.</p>

The state's appeal is largely credited to its tax-friendly policies, such as having no state income tax on Social Security benefits or retirement account withdrawals. In stark contrast, California experienced the largest net loss of retirees, with over 56,000 more seniors leaving the state than moving in. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the shifting motivations behind exercise, advocating for a move away from a singular focus on weight loss and aesthetics. It suggests that finding a form of movement that one genuinely enjoys, whether it be weightlifting, group fitness, or running, is key to building a sustainable and healthy habit. By reframing exercise as a source of strength, community, or mental clarity, individuals can develop a more positive and empowering relationship with their bodies and physical activity.</p>
