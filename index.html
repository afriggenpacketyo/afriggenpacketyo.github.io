          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has advanced to the quarter-finals of the Washington Open after a decisive straight-sets victory over former world number one Naomi Osaka. This win follows her earlier upset of the seventh seed, setting her up to face Maria Sakkari next. In the men's singles tournament, however, British contenders Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans were both knocked out in the last 16. Norrie lost to American Brandon Nakashima, while Evans, the 2023 tournament champion, was defeated by Corentin Moutet of France.</p>

          <p>Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez, the former Manchester United striker, has issued a public apology after being fined for making sexist comments on social media. The Mexican Football Federation condemned his statements, which included assertions that women are "failing" and "eradicating masculinity," as promoting harmful stereotypes. Hernandez expressed deep regret for any discomfort his words caused, stating he is committed to learning and growing from the experience. The remarks drew widespread criticism in Mexico, including from the country's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>

          <h2>Foldable Phones Offer Technological Appeal but Suffer from Practical Drawbacks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite their impressive technology and novelty, current foldable phones present significant compromises that may not justify their high price tags. Devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold and Google Pixel Fold offer large, flexible screens but are often bulkier, more fragile, and have shorter battery lives than traditional smartphones. The article argues that while the concept is exciting, the technology is still in an early phase with software that feels more like a beta version. It advises most consumers to wait for the technology to mature, noting that Apple is reportedly developing its own foldable models for a potential 2026 release.</p>

          <p>The parents of Raymond Orozco, a 22-year-old man fatally stabbed in downtown San Jose, are seeking justice and asking for public assistance in identifying the suspect.

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting the stage for the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after 50 years in public service, Evers' decision opens a key contest in the battleground state. His tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, but also by recent bipartisan cooperation on the state budget. The announcement is expected to draw a wide field of candidates from both parties.</p>

Nadella framed the current period as a dynamic and demanding era of progress, particularly with the rise of AI.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily extended a pause on a lower court ruling that would have prevented private individuals and groups from filing lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The case originates from a challenge by two tribal nations in North Dakota over a redistricting map they argued diluted Native American voting power. An 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel had ruled that only the U.S. Justice Department could bring such cases, a decision that would significantly weaken the landmark civil rights law.

          <p>The article posits that President Trump's proposal to relocate Gazans and redevelop the area has inadvertently fueled maximalist ambitions on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, complicating peace efforts. It argues that while many on both sides harbor private wishes for total control of the land, practical realities and international pressure have historically constrained these impulses. Trump's intervention, however, was interpreted by Israel's far-right as a green light for ethnic cleansing and resettlement, a stance Prime Minister Netanyahu has appeared to adopt. The author contends that for any lasting ceasefire to be achieved, the administration must disavow this vision and reaffirm that neither population will be displaced.</p>

Trump has persistently criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, a stance that challenges the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.

This behind-the-scenes struggle affects infrastructure projects, wildlife studies, and future hiring, with experts fearing the full impact will become apparent next summer.

          <p>Hulk Hogan, the iconic professional wrestler who propelled the sport into a global mainstream phenomenon, has died at the age of 71. Born Terry Bollea, he became a larger-than-life hero in the 1980s, known for his "Hulkamania" persona, signature leg drop, and catchphrases. He later reinvented himself as the villainous "Hollywood Hogan," leading the influential New World Order faction in the 1990s. Beyond the ring, Hogan was a pop culture figure who starred in movies and television, though his career was also marked by controversies, including a sex tape lawsuit and the use of racist language.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Sweeping Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Runaway Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite predictions of soaring prices, the sweeping tariffs announced by the Trump administration have not yet led to runaway inflation, though economists warn the effects are likely delayed rather than averted. Several factors have blunted the immediate impact, including the delayed implementation of tariffs on many major trading partners and businesses stockpiling inventory to absorb initial costs. However, with tariffs now in effect or soon to be, price increases on import-sensitive goods like electronics, apparel, and furniture are expected to become more noticeable later in the year. Economists suggest that the full inflationary impact may not peak until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers deciding where to place a significant sum like $25,000, the choice between a 6-month CD and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed rates and liquidity. Based on current rates, a CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more over six months than a savings account at 4.30%, with the added benefit of locking in that rate. The article advises that the decision should be based on individual financial needs; those requiring emergency access to funds may prefer a high-yield savings account, while those who can commit the funds for the full term can secure a better, guaranteed return with a CD.
