            <p>A Democratic National Committee social media post celebrating Easter featured photos of former presidents Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton, but notably excluded current President Joe Biden, sparking questions and criticism. Biden, who concluded his term earlier this year, chose not to seek re-election. Former President Donald Trump seized on the omission, criticizing Biden's policies and performance. The DNC did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the exclusion. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry revealed that "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders," contributed to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF initially claimed its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, but later video evidence showed the vehicles were clearly marked as ambulances with lights and sirens active. As a result of the inquiry, the deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed and another commanding officer will receive a reprimand. The Palestine Red Crescent Society has dismissed the report as an attempt to shift blame.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing bipartisan criticism for the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who was mistakenly deported despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican, called the deportation a "screw up," while Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, deemed it a "constitutional crisis." The administration's refusal to bring back Abrego Garcia has sparked debate over due process and the rights of immigrants, with Van Hollen advocating for a pressure campaign on El Salvador to return him.</p>
