        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent Russian incursions into NATO airspace, including drones in Poland and fighter jets in Estonia, have prompted a significant shift in European defense posture. Leaders from Poland, the UK, and even U.S. President Trump have issued strong warnings, suggesting that future violations may result in aircraft being shot down. This escalation reflects a growing consensus that the risks of inaction now outweigh the risks of a contained military response. NATO members are now actively planning to bolster air defenses, including a "drone wall," to counter what they perceive as deliberate Russian provocations designed to test the alliance's unity and resolve.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed lawsuits against California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania for refusing to provide their complete voter registration rolls. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the action is necessary to ensure states comply with federal laws requiring accurate voter list maintenance. However, the targeted states have cited privacy concerns and state laws that prohibit the disclosure of sensitive voter information, such as partial Social Security numbers. This legal battle unfolds amid President Trump's ongoing, unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud and his administration's efforts to implement stricter federal voting regulations.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are monitoring Tropical Storm Humberto and a nearby developing system, likely to be named Imelda, for a potential interaction known as the Fujiwhara effect. This rare phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, which can alter their paths and intensity. While experts consider a full merger unlikely due to the size difference between the storms, the possibility of them "dancing" around each other exists. Humberto is expected to strengthen into a hurricane over the Atlantic, but the potential interaction with the second, weaker storm adds a layer of complexity to forecasting its ultimate track.</p>

The project, significantly larger than the main White House building, is being funded by private and corporate donors, with President Trump also contributing personally. Major corporations like Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir are among those who have pledged nearly $200 million towards the construction costs. The new venue is designed to host up to 650 seated guests, greatly expanding the White House's capacity for large-scale events.</p>

          <p>Career federal prosecutors in Virginia have concluded in a memo that there is no probable cause to bring criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite this recommendation, President Trump's newly appointed U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury before the statute of limitations expires. This move follows a public directive from President Trump to prosecute his political adversaries, raising concerns among career officials about the politicization of the Justice Department. The internal conflict highlights significant tensions within the agency over prosecutorial independence and ethics.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop buying Russian oil as part of a broader effort to economically isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Trump linked potential compliance to favorable deals, including the sale of F-35 fighter jets and the lifting of sanctions on Turkey's defense industry. Despite being a NATO member, Turkey has maintained significant energy trade with Russia, positioning itself as a neutral party. The meeting highlighted the complex diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Turkey, with Trump leveraging military hardware to align Ankara with Western sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for the family of a 32-year-old man who died after riding the Stardust Racers roller coaster at Universal's Epic Universe state that his death was a result of blunt impact injuries, not his pre-existing spinal disability. They allege that Kevin Rodriguez Zavala repeatedly struck his head on a restraint during the ride, causing fatal trauma. The family's legal team is challenging Universal's initial statement that the ride functioned properly, arguing that a lack of malfunction does not preclude safety issues. The Orlando medical examiner ruled the death an accident caused by multiple blunt impact injuries, and the ride remains closed pending a review.</p>

While Sherrill's campaign aims to tie Ciattarelli directly to Trump's agenda, Ciattarelli insists that New Jersey's challenges are distinct from federal politics.

This multi-year initiative, now over 90% complete, responds to long-standing health and safety concerns raised by flight crews who have reported illness after exposure. These "fume events" are caused by heated engine oil leaking into the plane's bleed air system, which can lead to neurological problems. In addition to replacing the engines, Delta is also exploring the use of new synthetic turbine oils to further reduce risks to passengers and crew.</p>

If this analysis is correct, it implies that our own species and Neanderthals also began to emerge at least half a million years earlier than previously thought.

          <p>Shares of used-car retailer CarMax fell by more than 20% after the company failed to meet Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue. The company reported a 6% decline in revenue and a 28% drop in net income compared to the previous year, with overall vehicle sales also falling. CEO Bill Nash described the quarter as "challenging," attributing the poor performance to shifting market conditions and depreciation of its inventory. The significant stock drop, which sent shares to their lowest price since March 2020, also negatively impacted the stock prices of other auto retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order approving a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the United States, classifying it as a "qualified divestiture" under a recent federal law. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture where American investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake, though parent company ByteDance will retain a 19.9% share. A key component of the deal involves copying and retraining TikTok's powerful content algorithm to run exclusively on U.S. user data, which will be hosted and secured by Oracle to address national security concerns about potential Chinese government influence.</p>

          <p>The FBI has revealed that the sniper who attacked an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas left a note stating his goal was to make agents fear for their lives. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, killed one detainee and wounded two others before taking his own life. An investigation found that Jahn had recently searched for apps tracking ICE agents and downloaded a list of DHS facilities. The attack is being investigated as an act of targeted violence, prompting ICE to place all its facilities on a higher state of alert to prevent similar politically motivated attacks.</p>

          <p>Starting September 30, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will end its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, requiring nearly 70 million beneficiaries to receive payments via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The agency states the transition to an all-electronic system is a modernization effort that will improve efficiency, enhance security, and save costs. While the SSA has been notifying recipients of the change, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means to receive payments. The move follows a presidential executive order mandating the digitization of all federal payments to reduce fraud and delays.</p>

          <p>The recent price increase announced by Disney+ is the latest in a series of hikes across the streaming industry, including from Netflix, Apple TV+, and Peacock, frustrating consumers who initially cut cable to save money. This trend reflects a shift in the industry's business model, moving away from subscriber growth at all costs towards profitability. Analysts note that while companies are testing their pricing power, consumers are becoming more selective, subscribing seasonally to watch specific content before canceling. This has created a battle of wills, forcing streamers to find new ways to retain customers, such as bundling services or staggering episode releases.</p>

          <p>Country artist Margo Price's latest album, "Hard Headed Woman," marks a significant personal and professional reinvention, spurred by her decision to stop drinking alcohol in 2021. Price explains that this change allowed her to establish healthier boundaries, leading her to hire a new management team and replace her longtime band to refocus on her classic country sound. The new music reflects this journey of self-empowerment, with songs that are both deeply personal and politically outspoken. The album represents a deliberate return to her Nashville roots after her previous record explored more psychedelic rock influences.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his argument that the U.S. should regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, primarily due to its strategic proximity to China's nuclear weapons development and testing facilities. Although experts note China's main manufacturing sites are deeper inland, the Lop Nur test range is about 1,200 miles from Bagram. The push comes as the Pentagon monitors China's rapid nuclear arsenal expansion. However, the Taliban has rejected any plan to hand over the base, citing the 2020 Doha agreement, and defense officials suggest that reclaiming it would be a major military undertaking without a negotiated deal.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a "phased restart" of its operations after a cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. The company is now able to process invoices and clear a backlog of payments to its suppliers, though its manufacturing plants remain closed until at least next month. The prolonged shutdown has raised serious concerns about the financial viability of smaller firms in JLR's supply chain. In response, the UK government has confirmed it is working around the clock on a potential support package to prevent these critical suppliers from going bankrupt.</p>

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires has concluded that significant delays in issuing evacuation warnings were caused by a lack of resources and outdated emergency alert policies. The report, commissioned after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed over 30 people, identified critical staffing shortages, unreliable communication systems, and inconsistent field reporting as major weaknesses. While praising the heroic actions of frontline responders, the review highlighted systemic failures that hampered the overall effectiveness of the emergency response. The county's Board of Supervisors is scheduled to review the findings to improve future preparedness.</p>
