        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights the challenges women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) face when considering pregnancy, as contraception is often the primary treatment for the condition. Marianne Barry, a teaching assistant from Cardiff, shares her struggle with PMDD symptoms and her fear of discontinuing her contraceptive pill to conceive. Dr. Llinos Roberts emphasizes the limited research and treatment options available for PMDD, often leading to misdiagnosis as depression or anxiety. The Welsh government acknowledges the need for improved diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of PMDD within its Women's Health Plan for Wales, allocating £3m to address the issue.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to manage the complexities of global trade, particularly in response to tariffs. Companies are deploying AI tools to visualize supply chains, assess the impact of tariffs, and make informed decisions about adjustments to sourcing and pricing. Salesforce has developed an AI agent that processes changes to the U.S. customs system, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to simulate the impact of tariffs on different parts and materials. While AI is not a 'silver bullet,' it enhances trade policy by transforming global trade challenges into data-driven advantages.</p>

          <p>This article reports on the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where famine looms due to restricted aid access. While Israel has allowed a limited number of aid trucks to enter, critics argue it is insufficient, with the UN reporting delays in distribution due to security clearance issues. A substantial buffer zone has formed behind the border, with thousands of tons of food assistance and aid trucks awaiting entry. The article details the roles of UNRWA, WFP, UNICEF, and various international NGOs in providing aid, while also highlighting logistical challenges such as damaged infrastructure and fuel shortages that hinder distribution efforts. The article indicates the population of Gaza is at risk of famine in the coming weeks if the influx remains at 100 trucks and distribution issues continue.</p>

          <p>The government's child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, has been delayed, with a spokesperson stating it will be published later in the year, potentially in the autumn alongside the Budget. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, is evaluating measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. While the SNP has criticized the delay, accusing Labour of prioritizing imitating Nigel Farage over tackling child poverty, some charities believe the delay could allow for a more substantial and effective strategy to be developed. The government maintains its commitment to addressing the structural causes of child poverty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing trend of "quiet quitting" among Japan's Gen Z, who are increasingly prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs to have more "me time." Experts suggest this shift is influenced by witnessing their parents' sacrifices for companies and a desire for a more balanced life, especially after the pandemic prompted a reevaluation of priorities. The article highlights that this change could lead to happier individuals and potentially boost the economy as young people spend more on leisure activities.</p>

A rain delay limited starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw to just two innings, and the lengthy game forced the bullpen to cover 11 innings. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth, but Teoscar Hernández's RBI double in the 13th inning secured the win.

It discusses the pressures and expectations placed on local players, who are often seen as representing their community. While fans may idealize the notion of players spending their entire careers with their boyhood clubs, the reality is often different, with players sometimes sacrificing loyalty for opportunities at bigger clubs.

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan’s representative office and relocated it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a deepening relationship with Beijing. This move underscores a trend of diminishing Taiwanese presence in Africa, driven by robust economic ties between African nations and China. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, potentially in retaliation for Taiwan’s growing ties with Somaliland. Experts note that Beijing has historically been assertive in seeking to limit African recognition of Taiwan, prompting African states to avoid actions that could offend Beijing.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Germany's selective approach to confronting its Nazi past, highlighting instances where acknowledgment of historical crimes is prioritized when it aligns with the country's self-image, but ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an early SS supporter who profited from slave labor during the Nazi era, is cited as an example of this selective amnesia. The author argues that Germany's refusal to fully confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide undermines its commitment to "never again."</p>

          <p>This article examines Hong Kong's critical role in advancing the internationalization of China's yuan amid geopolitical tensions and discussions about de-dollarization. According to Mary Huen Wai-yi, businesses in Qatar are keen to use the yuan by leveraging the financial tools available in Hong Kong. An increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments would benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially amid strengthening ties between China and oil-rich Qatar. The article highlights that the US' trade war has prompted more countries to consider alternatives to the US dollar, aligning with China's strategy to internationalize its currency and assert financial independence.</p>

          <p>This article explores the controversy surrounding the use of facial recognition technology in the search for inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail. While authorities credit the technology, operated by Project N.O.L.A., with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, civil rights organizations and politicians raise concerns about privacy and constitutional rights. The ACLU argues that live facial recognition is a radical escalation of surveillance power, while some Republicans in Congress express concerns over the technology's impact on citizens' rights.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1 as it approached for landing, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact, attributed to a temporary antenna issue, caused confusion for air traffic controllers who lacked a confident fix on the helicopter's location. While the Army maintains the helicopter followed its approved flight path, the incident has raised concerns about close calls between military aircraft and commercial planes near the airport, especially after a fatal midair collision earlier this year. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before providing it directly to the agency.</p>

Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable rice options, as the average price of domestic rice has nearly doubled compared to the previous year due to a poor harvest and increased demand.</p>
