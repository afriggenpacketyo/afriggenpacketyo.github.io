        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The justices also considered the legality of nationwide injunctions issued by district court judges against presidential policies. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that nationwide injunctions create an unfair legal playing field for the government and limit the percolation of legal questions. Several justices expressed concerns about the potential chaos and delays that could arise if nationwide injunctions were eliminated, with Justice Sotomayor emphasizing the order's violation of Supreme Court precedents and Justice Jackson raising concerns about a 'Catch Me If You Can' system of justice. The court's decision is expected by early summer.</p>

          <p>New federal requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID-19 shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. Scientific advisors are debating whether to continue recommending immunization for all Americans or switch to a risk-based strategy. The FDA has requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the need for the vaccine in children under 12. Some experts fear these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule.</p>

The U.S. remains committed to arming Taiwan and opposes any attempt to take the self-governed island by force.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator defended the company's capital expenditure plans, stating that the company is meeting demand signals from major hyperscalers. The company expects capex of $20 billion to $23 billion for the year, which includes the impact of a recent OpenAI deal. Intrator explained that the increased capex budget is driven by success within the company and demand from clients. CoreWeave has a growing list of major clients, including Microsoft and Nvidia, and recently signed a deal with another hyperscaler.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, told Congress that he’s directed the Food and Drug Administration to review regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone, citing a flawed study on the widely used medication. Reproductive rights advocates and experts are deeply disturbed by Kennedy’s comments, noting that decades of research have proven mifepristone to be extremely safe and effective. The decision will be informed by a report from a conservative think tank claiming that 11% of mifepristone users experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, which experts say has a clear conflict of interest and wasn’t peer-reviewed.</p>

          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda is in jeopardy as several Republican hard-liners signaled their opposition to advancing the package out of the House Budget Committee. Concerns about the bill adding to the national debt are driving the opposition. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to address the concerns and move the bill forward, but faces a tough road ahead due to the slim Republican majority. The effort to pass the Trump-backed bill is a crucial test of Johnson's speakership.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, Cassie Ventura's cross-examination delved into their relationship, drug use, and explicit texts. The defense questioned Ventura about her text messages leading up to the premiere of "The Perfect Match" and a "freak off" with Combs at the InterContinental Hotel in March 2016. The defense suggested that Combs may have been suffering from drug withdrawal before the assault captured by hotel surveillance cameras and that Ventura proposed the 'freak off.' Court has adjourned for the day, and Ventura will return to the stand Friday.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, marking a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to raise penalties for unlawful crossings into the US. The judge ruled that immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged. The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally. The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles of the border.</p>

          <p>President Trump lowered his tariffs on China, but for many small businesses, 30 percent is still a crippling burden. Unlike large retailers, smaller companies that rely on imports from China tend to have minimal leverage to negotiate with their Chinese suppliers. Business owners are considering cutting the cheapest items, layoffs, and putting new products on pause. The 90-day pause may temporarily help unstick the effective trade embargo, but a long-term deal is needed to predictably make long-term trade, investment, and sourcing decisions.</p>
