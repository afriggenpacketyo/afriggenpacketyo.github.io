          <p>President Trump has named Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination. Pirro, a former district attorney and staunch Trump supporter, will step down from Fox News to take on the role. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and past advocacy, while critics voice concerns about her potential focus on prosecuting political enemies. The appointment raises questions about the administration's legal tactics and potential challenges to criminal cases brought under her authority, as it appears to bypass Senate confirmation processes.</p>

          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to impress investors, who remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, intended to revive growth, was seen as a stopgap rather than a comprehensive solution, according to analysts. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more focused on industrial and social needs rather than direct market support.</p>

          <p>A report reveals that at least 119 Amtrak employees and several healthcare providers participated in a $12 million healthcare fraud scheme. Employees accepted kickbacks in exchange for their insurance information, which providers then used to file fraudulent claims for services never rendered.

          <p>Some Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting the start date should be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in fighting fascism and challenge what they view as a Western-centric narrative. The call for a rewritten history comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti, leading to its temporary closure for repairs.

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump wants to create a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017. The proposal aims to offset the cost of extending other tax cuts and potentially protect Medicaid funding, though it faces opposition from some Republicans.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported a disappointing first quarter due to inclement weather, but promising signs of a stronger second quarter boosted investor confidence. Comparable store sales slowed in February, but improved in March and April, driven by traffic and average check growth. The company's expansion plans and efficiency initiatives are progressing, but rising commodity cost inflation is expected to squeeze margins. Despite the inflation pressures, Texas Roadhouse's brand strength and value proposition position it well to navigate economic uncertainties.</p>
