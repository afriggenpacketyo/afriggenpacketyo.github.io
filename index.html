        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's long-standing political and military influence in its former African colonies, particularly in the Sahel region, is rapidly declining amid growing anti-French sentiment. This shift is creating significant challenges for French multinational corporations, which once enjoyed preferential treatment but now face intense competition from countries like China, Russia, and Turkey. Companies such as the nuclear firm Orano are losing licenses and suspending operations due to the changing geopolitical landscape. In response, French businesses are being forced to adopt new strategies, including forming local partnerships and shifting focus to other African markets to survive.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the severe malnutrition crisis in Gaza through the story of Mohammad Al-Motawaq, a skeletal 18-month-old boy. His mother, a malnourished widow, is unable to produce breast milk or find food for him, reflecting the dire situation faced by many families. Doctors and aid workers warn that chronic starvation is causing irreversible neurological and physical damage to a generation of Gazan children. The United Nations has cautioned that mass starvation is imminent as Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid continue to limit access to essential supplies for the enclave's population.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has met with the Department of Justice, sparking speculation about what information she might provide regarding the late Jeffrey Epstein and his network. This comes as the Trump administration faces pressure over its handling of Epstein-related files. Legal experts and commentators are debating whether Maxwell's testimony can be trusted, given her previous perjury charges, and what she might gain from cooperating. While she possesses intimate knowledge of Epstein's operations, it remains unclear if her information will lead to new revelations or if it is a political maneuver to manage public perception.</p>

          <p>This in-depth analysis posits that the key to understanding Donald Trump's political and economic actions is his insatiable avarice and focus on personal dealmaking. The article argues that Trump's approach transcends typical desires for power or prestige, centering instead on the relentless accumulation of money itself. His strategies, particularly his use of tariffs and involvement in cryptocurrency, are framed as methods to subvert impersonal markets in favor of personal, adversarial deals that enhance his brand and wealth. This egocentric economic model, or "egonomics," prioritizes personal gain over coherent policy, using the performance of dealmaking as its own reward.</p>

The anonymous organizer, a self-described concerned citizen, stated the project aims to raise awareness about recent layoffs and budget reductions within the National Park Service.

Scammers on motorcycles deliberately spread sharp objects on the road to puncture car tires and then guide the stranded drivers to nearby mechanics who are allegedly part of the scheme. These mechanics are accused of creating additional holes in the tires to inflate repair costs, sometimes charging prices equivalent to a new set of tires. Despite a police crackdown, the fast-moving nature of the scam makes it difficult to stop, with authorities focusing on raiding suspect repair shops.</p>

The signs, placed near four struggling hospitals in Missouri, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Montana, directly link their potential closure to Trump's policies, specifically the over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid from his One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). While Republicans included a temporary "rural health transformation fund," analyses suggest it will not cover the long-term losses.

Without these curated guides, it has become harder for audiences to discover niche and emerging artists, and for those artists to gain visibility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States has its roots in the post-Civil War era, where it was used as a way for employers to avoid paying fair wages to formerly enslaved Black workers. This system evolved into the modern "tipped minimum wage," which under federal law is just $2.13 an hour, with the expectation that customer tips will make up the difference to the standard minimum wage. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this structure effectively shifts the responsibility of paying a worker's wage from the employer to the customer. This historical context explains why tipping is so ingrained in American service industries.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious CECOT mega-prison have described enduring brutal conditions, violence, and sexual abuse by guards. The men were sent to the maximum-security facility, built for accused gang members, under a rarely-used U.S. law, accused without evidence of being gang members themselves. Recently released as part of a prisoner exchange, they are among the first former inmates to speak publicly about their experiences. Their accounts describe inhumane living conditions and a system of abuse in a prison largely shielded from outside scrutiny, raising serious human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has commented on a failed recall vote in Taiwan, characterizing the outcome as a rejection of "political manipulation" by the island's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). A spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of provoking political strife and attempting to suppress dissent. The vote, which was backed by the DPP, failed to recall any of the 24 targeted lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. Beijing's statement reflects its ongoing political pressure against Taiwan's current leadership, whom it views as separatists.</p>

          <p>The daughter of a woman murdered in 1994 has expressed conflicted feelings about the recent U.S. deportation of her mother's killer, Thongxay Nilakout, to South Sudan. Birte Pfleger, whose mother was killed during a robbery, stated that while she wanted him gone, she is also concerned that he was denied constitutional due process rights in the controversial deportation. Nilakout, a Laotian national, was among a group of convicted criminals sent to the conflict-torn African nation under a contentious Trump administration policy. Pfleger's perspective adds a complex layer to the debate, balancing personal grief with fundamental principles of law.</p>

The project not only provides vital hydration for animals but also offers researchers valuable insights into their behavior.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinkholes, which are depressions formed when water erodes underlying bedrock, are reportedly becoming more frequent due to climate change. Experts explain that intensifying extreme weather events, such as severe droughts followed by heavy rainfall, destabilize the ground and increase the risk of collapse. Regions with soluble bedrock like limestone, known as karst terrain, are particularly vulnerable, with hotspots in the US, Turkey, and China. Over-pumping of groundwater during droughts further exacerbates the problem, highlighting the interconnected challenges of water management and climate adaptation in preventing these geological hazards.</p>

The beetles are destructive in both their larval stage, when they eat roots, and as adults, when they consume leaves and fruit.

          <p>A recent study using GoPro cameras attached to polar bears in Canada's Hudson Bay has revealed alarming findings about their health. Scientists observed that 19 out of 20 bears lost an average of 46 pounds over just three weeks as they were forced to spend more time on land due to melting sea ice. The loss of their primary hunting platform for high-fat seals is compelling the bears to seek less nutritious land-based food sources like berries and carcasses. This alternative diet is insufficient to sustain their weight, highlighting the direct and severe impact of climate change on the species' survival.</p>
