          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. Judge Michael Farbiarz issued a preliminary injunction, citing potential damage to Khalil's career, reputation, and freedom of speech. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's activities compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. While the administration can still pursue deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application, the judge found that the primary reason for detention was Rubio's determination.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has experienced a relative calm after a night of curfew enforcement and mass arrests following days of protests sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration raids. Mayor Karen Bass attributed the unrest to the federal government's immigration actions, which she said have provoked fear and panic among residents. National Guard troops have been deployed to assist in quelling the unrest, and federal prosecutors have charged individuals for violent acts against law enforcement. The protests, which have also spread to other U.S. cities, have intensified the political row between the Trump administration and state officials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot detain Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil based on claims that he poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech was being chilled, leading to irreparable harm. While Khalil can still be detained based on claims of inaccurate green card application information, the judge's order provides a legal victory for those challenging the administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. Khalil has been detained since March and missed the birth of his first child.</p>

          <p>Businesses and residents in L.A.'s Little Tokyo are navigating a surreal week amid ongoing protests and a new curfew. The demonstrations have resulted in decreased foot traffic and vandalism, impacting local businesses. While many support the protests, they also express concern about the damage and disruption caused by the unrest. The curfew has added another layer of complexity, with businesses closing earlier to ensure employees can get home before it takes effect. Despite the challenges, community members are trying to maintain a sense of normalcy while addressing the underlying issues driving the protests.</p>

          <p>The UK's Spending Review has dominated headlines, with the chancellor dedicating an extra £29bn a year to the NHS, prompting warnings of potential tax increases. While the NHS and defence are considered the "big winners," some critics are calling the plans a "reckless splurge" that voters will be paying off for years. The review is seen as a rejection of austerity, but concerns remain about the impact on other departments and the likelihood of future tax rises to balance the books. The police and defence may be sacrificed in the Spending Review.</p>
