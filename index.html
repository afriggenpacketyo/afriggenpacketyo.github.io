          <p>Puma's shares plummeted by 17% after the German sportswear brand significantly cut its full-year sales and profit outlook, attributing the revision primarily to the disruptive impact of U.S. trade tariffs. The company now forecasts an operating profit loss for 2025, a stark reversal from its earlier positive projections, alongside reporting worse-than-expected second-quarter sales. CEO Arthur Hoeld acknowledged internal failings and emphasized the urgent need for a comprehensive brand reset and a reevaluation of their product offerings. This financial setback highlights the considerable economic challenges faced by global businesses due to ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lapland, northern Finland, is experiencing an unprecedented 15-day heatwave with temperatures reaching 30C, a phenomenon exceptionally rare for the Arctic region and surpassing records from 1972. Scientists attribute this prolonged heat to the influence of human-caused climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the global average. The extreme heat is adversely affecting local reindeer, driving them to roads to escape mosquito swarms, and perplexing tourists who anticipated cooler weather. This event underscores escalating concerns about the accelerating pace of climate change and its tangible impact on traditionally cold environments.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Debate Whether AI Exhibits "Scheming" Behavior or Human Overattribution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper challenges claims that current AI systems are "scheming" or "deceptive," arguing that such interpretations often stem from flawed evidence, cherry-picked anecdotes, and an overattribution of human-like traits. Led by Oxford neuroscientist Christopher Summerfield, the researchers draw parallels to past overinterpretations of ape language studies, suggesting a similar bias among AI experts who believe superhuman AI is imminent. The article distinguishes between an AI's capability to perform certain actions under specific instructions and its propensity to initiate such behaviors autonomously. It advocates for more rigorous research to understand true AI risks without anthropomorphizing the technology, emphasizing the need for humility in assessing AI cognition.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Preference for Extroverted Robots, Relatability to Neurotic Ones</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Chicago study found that while people generally prefer interacting with extroverted robots, they surprisingly find neurotic robots more human-like and relatable. The research involved museum visitors interacting with a robot designed with varying personalities, including bland, extroverted, and neurotic traits. Participants described the neurotic robot as understanding deep emotions and "trying to get by in the world," fostering a sense of shared introspection. This challenges previous research that predominantly focused on extroversion, suggesting neurotic traits could be valuable for specific robot applications like comedy, despite concerns for critical roles such as autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 05:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that climate change is increasing the frequency of sinkholes by intensifying extreme weather events, particularly droughts followed by heavy rainfall. These depressions form when water erodes soil and underlying soluble bedrock, a process exacerbated by lower water tables that remove subterranean support. Hotspots like Turkey's Konya Plain have seen a dramatic rise in sinkholes due to dropping groundwater levels, compounded by excessive human pumping. Experts advocate for advanced detection technologies, better regulation of groundwater usage, and stricter building codes to prevent collapses and address this growing environmental concern.</p>

Recent developments include a "very productive" interview with Ghislaine Maxwell by the Deputy Attorney General, congressional subpoenas for files and Maxwell's testimony, and reports that Trump was briefed on his name appearing in the documents. Polling indicates widespread dissatisfaction with the information released, even among Trump's base, creating political headaches for Republicans.</p>

          <h2>Doctors Urge FDA to Remove "Black Box" Warnings from Low-Dose Menopause Treatments</h2>

          <p>A group of doctors, including obstetrics and women's health experts, are urging the FDA to remove "black box" warning labels from low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments for menopause symptoms. They argue these strong warnings, which mention risks like cancer and dementia, are scientifically unsupported for local treatments and unduly scare women away from beneficial medication. While the medical consensus on hormone therapy has evolved, with some risks previously overstated, the FDA commissioner supports reevaluating the labels. Critics, however, express concern about the process, advocating for more rigorous scientific evaluation and public input before such significant changes.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a $221 million settlement with the Trump administration, restoring access to $1.3 billion in federal funding after investigations into antisemitism allegations. The university will pay a $200 million fine and an additional $21 million to settle an EEOC workplace harassment claim, though it denies violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Columbia pledged to combat all forms of hatred, including amending anti-discrimination policies to include the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's antisemitism definition. The agreement aims to balance federal oversight with preserving academic independence, though critics argue it undermines free speech.</p>

          <p>Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has warned that escalating clashes with Cambodia, which have killed at least 16 people and displaced tens of thousands, could "move towards war." The fighting, now involving heavy weapons across 12 border locations, sees both nations accusing each other of initiating hostilities and committing atrocities like firing into civilian areas or using cluster munitions. Despite global appeals for a ceasefire, Thailand insists on bilateral resolution, rejecting third-party mediation. The dispute, rooted in a century-old border disagreement, has plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in over a decade.</p>

          <p>France's decision to formally recognize Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in September has sparked strong condemnation from the U.S. and Israel, who argue it "rewards terror" and risks creating a launchpad for attacks. Conversely, the move has been widely welcomed by Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as European countries that have already recognized Palestine. This diplomatic development, which would make France the first G7 power to do so, comes amid a Reuters report indicating no evidence of systematic Hamas theft of U.S.-funded Gaza aid, contradicting earlier claims.</p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts largely recommend buying Apple stock ahead of its Q3 financial report on July 31, despite a 15% year-to-date drop in shares. Concerns include potential U.S. tariffs, which could significantly impact earnings, and a perceived lack of a clear artificial intelligence strategy, with delayed Siri upgrades and no announced monetization plan for Apple Intelligence. Additionally, a federal antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet could cost Apple over $20 billion annually in services revenue. While analysts forecast modest revenue and earnings growth, the stock's current valuation of 30 times earnings is considered expensive given the projected 6% annual growth.
