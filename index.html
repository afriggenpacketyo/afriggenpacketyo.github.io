          <p>The Trump administration has lifted its stop-work order on Equinor's Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm project in New York, allowing construction to resume after a compromise was reached regarding a gas pipeline. Governor Kathy Hochul stated that the decision came after discussions with Equinor and White House officials, highlighting the project's support for 1,500 union jobs. Equinor aims to proceed with installation activities this year, minimizing the impact of the work stoppage to commence commercial operations by 2027, marking the first offshore wind project to directly supply electricity to New York City. The initial order was issued by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who cited insufficient analysis and consultation regarding potential effects.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing hurdles in Congress due to disagreements among Republicans over spending cuts, Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions. Some right-wing lawmakers argue that the proposed cuts are insufficient to reduce the national debt, while others, particularly from states with high taxes, are objecting to the cap on local tax deductions. The bill proposes about $4.9 trillion in tax breaks, partially offset by cuts to Medicaid and green energy incentives, but faces criticism for being "front-loaded in deficits and backloaded in savings." Speaker Johnson is attempting to navigate these divisions to secure enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that would permit asset managers to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) share classes of existing mutual funds, potentially providing investors with more choices and tax benefits. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief, seeking to operate under a similar structure to Vanguard's existing approach. A key concern for the SEC is ensuring that ETF shareholders are not negatively impacted by tax liabilities typically associated with mutual funds. Dimensional Fund Advisors has proposed updated guidelines for fund oversight to address these tax implications, potentially setting a template for the industry.</p>

          <h2>Home Depot Maintains Pricing Strategy Amid Tariff Concerns, Defying Walmart's Approach</h2>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. The company is working to diversify its import sources, aiming to have no single country outside the U.S. represent more than 10% of purchases within a year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would raise prices to cover higher costs from tariffs. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations.</p>

          <p>Representative Yassamin Ansari introduced the Artemis Act, inspired by the deportation of Iranian Christian convert Artemis Ghasemzadeh, to prevent the expedited removal of individuals fleeing religious persecution. The bill seeks to ensure that those fleeing countries with religious persecution have the chance to claim asylum in a U.S. immigration court. While the bill's passage is unlikely given Republican control of the House, it symbolizes support for migrants facing persecution. Ghasemzadeh, deported to Panama, expressed hope that the legislation would prevent similar situations in the future.</p>

The election will not shift the court's liberal majority, but the outcome could expand or maintain the current 4-3 split.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that over half of US companies plan to raise prices to accommodate the cost of President Trump's tariffs. The survey reveals a decline in exporters' confidence and an expectation of lower turnover. While some companies have attempted to mitigate the impact by stockpiling goods, many anticipate passing tariff costs onto consumers. Inflation expectations have risen, and major retailers like Walmart and Mattel have announced that they will have to increase prices due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A former Chinese diplomat suggests that President Trump's trade policies are fracturing Western unity and potentially reshaping the global order. Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, stated that Trump's global tariff war has worsened conflicts with US allies, shaking transatlantic ties. He noted that accusations against allies and the sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia could lead US allies to consider new options. The tariffs announced in April, though temporarily suspended, have contributed to the growing fault lines.</p>

Excluding AI investment, there is no meaningful uptick for companies not leveraging AI, with investment from this group essentially flat.
