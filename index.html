          <p>A 20-year-old American man from Florida, Sayfollah Musallet, was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank town of Sinjil. His family states he was protecting his land and that settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching him for hours, leading to his death before he could receive hospital care. Musallet is the fifth American killed in the West Bank since October 2023, and his family is demanding a U.S.-led investigation into the incident. The Israel Defense Forces are aware of the reports and are looking into the violent confrontation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. President Trump stated the move is necessary to create a more "reciprocal" global trade landscape and address long-standing trade deficits. The announcement, communicated through letters to the respective leaders, warns that any retaliatory tariffs will be met with further increases. Both the EU and Mexico have expressed their disagreement, with the EU vowing to take necessary steps to safeguard its interests. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions flared during the third Test at Lord's over England's use of delay tactics, which India's players protested. England opener Zak Crawley successfully delayed the final moments of play to ensure he only faced one over instead of a potential two, prompting an angry reaction from India's captain. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed the complaints, pointing to India's own time-wasting earlier in the match, including a player receiving a massage on the field. The incident added a dramatic finish to the day's play.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has subtly pushed back against criticisms from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. The central bank updated its website with a "Frequently Asked Questions" page to address claims of it being an "ostentatious overhaul," clarifying that no "VIP dining rooms" are being built and explaining cost increases. This response follows escalating attacks from administration officials, who have accused Fed Chair Jerome Powell of mismanagement, suggesting a campaign to potentially remove him from his position.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly terminated at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, the firings were guided by the department's "weaponization working group" and included individuals who may have had only minor support roles. This move follows the earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors from the probes. The dismissals have reportedly caused significant concern among the DOJ's career employees, reminiscent of previous purges.</p>

          <h2>Market Analysis Suggests Investors Are Less Alarmed by Latest Round of Trump Tariff Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump renewing his tariff campaign against major trading partners, the stock market has remained relatively stable near record highs. This contrasts with the market panic seen during a similar tariff blitz in April. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation style and are focusing more on underlying economic fundamentals and corporate earnings. Key bullish themes, such as deregulation and the growth of artificial intelligence, are seen as powerful drivers that currently outweigh the concerns over potential trade disruptions.

          <p>The UK's third heatwave of the year reached its peak on Saturday, with temperatures hitting 33°C (91.4°F) in Ross on Wye. The widespread heat saw Scotland record its warmest day of the year and Northern Ireland its hottest in nearly three years. The conditions have led to hosepipe bans for millions in England and wildfire warnings in Scotland. The heat has also disrupted travel and sporting events, with amber heat health alerts in effect for southern England, signifying a likely increase in demand for health services and risk to vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Two fathers have initiated legal action against the UK government in an effort to implement a ban on smartphones in all English schools. They argue that the current guidance, which leaves the decision up to individual headteachers, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harmful content and cyberbullying. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, warning of their intent to seek a judicial review. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides broader protections.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has uncovered baffling details, revealing that both of the jet's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff. Cockpit audio captures one pilot asking the other why he did it, with the other denying he had. This action starved the engines of fuel, leading to a total power loss and the subsequent crash that killed 260 people. Investigators are now focused on determining who moved the switches and why, as this action is highly unusual and difficult to perform accidentally.</p>
