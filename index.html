          <p>The Attorney General's Office in the UK will review the sentence of a 15-year-old boy convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli. The boy, who received a seven-year custody sentence, racially abused and physically assaulted Mr. Kohli in a park in Leicestershire. A 13-year-old girl who filmed the attack received a non-custodial sentence, which is not being referred for review, drawing criticism from a local MP. The review, conducted under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, will determine if the boy's sentence should be increased by the Court of Appeal.</p>

          <p>Tyler Webb, 23, has been sentenced to a nine-year, four-month hybrid order for encouraging a vulnerable woman to self-harm and attempt suicide for his sexual gratification. This is a landmark case, as Webb was the first person charged under the UK's new Online Safety Act 2023 for encouraging serious self-harm. He met the victim online, manipulated her into sending images of her injuries, and instructed her to end her life on a video call. The victim's bravery in reporting the crime was praised by police for bringing Webb to justice and preventing him from targeting others.</p>

Altman criticized the current political focus on eliminating billionaires rather than on creating pathways for everyone to achieve similar prosperity.

Upon returning to the court, Shelton served three aces and an unreturnable serve to secure his victory.

          <p>President Trump's recently announced trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through the country, is seen as a direct effort to counter Chinese manufacturers evading U.S. tariffs. However, economists and trade experts are questioning the pact's feasibility, as it will be difficult for Vietnam to enforce and define what constitutes a transshipped good versus a product genuinely made in Vietnam. The deal's effectiveness hinges on whether the tariff applies only to pure transshipments or to any Vietnamese product containing Chinese components, which could cause significant economic disruption.

The company's primary demographic consists of young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against potential domestic regulatory pressures.

While the recognition provides diplomatic legitimacy, a former Taliban official noted that Russia and China cannot offer the level of financial support previously provided by the U.S. and its allies.

The author argues that Britain's military overreach, particularly through the Coercive Acts of 1774, was a primary catalyst that transformed colonial resistance into the American Revolution. The piece highlights how the presence of soldiers escalated tensions, leading to events like the Boston Massacre and the battles at Lexington and Concord. It serves as a historical warning that using military force to handle domestic unrest can provoke fear, anger, and unpredictable violence.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly denied that Kilmar Ábrego García was mistreated while detained in the country's notorious Cecot prison. Ábrego García, who was wrongly extradited from the U.S., alleged through his lawyers that he suffered beatings, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. Bukele countered these claims by sharing photos and videos of Ábrego García in a cell, questioning why he looked well if he had been tortured. The case has drawn scrutiny, especially as it coincides with a deal where the U.S. will pay El Salvador to imprison alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on the al-Baqa Cafeteria in Gaza City, intended to kill a Hamas operative, resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women and children. The BBC confirmed at least 26 of the fatalities, who were artists, students, and cafe staff gathered at the popular seaside spot. The target, Hisham Ayman Mansour, was described as a mid-ranking Hamas field commander. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the incident is under review and that it took steps to mitigate civilian harm, but the high number of non-combatant casualties has intensified questions about the proportionality of Israel's military actions.</p>

The group, which has recently expanded, faces challenges in converting its significant economic weight into unified geopolitical influence. Internal divisions, such as the India-China border dispute and differing stances on global issues, along with the failure to present a united front against U.S. policies, highlight the limitations of the forum.

          <p>Researchers have uncovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. The analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutritious marrow and fat. This process, which required planning and organization, provided a crucial, high-energy food source that was essential for survival, particularly to avoid protein poisoning from a lean-meat diet. The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence showing that Neanderthals were more sophisticated and strategic than previously believed.</p>

Peroni was 27 when she was last seen with Sanfratello at a party, reportedly walking into a wooded area after an argument. The new DNA evidence, combined with the original investigation, led a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, who has been arrested in California and is awaiting extradition.</p>

          <p>In response to recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear facilities, Iran has officially suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The move raises questions about whether Iran will remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the extent to which IAEA inspectors will have access. The article traces the history of Iran's nuclear program, from its U.S.-backed origins in the 1950s to the 2015 JCPOA deal and its subsequent unraveling. Experts warn that despite the attacks, Iran retains the capability to restart its program and may be pushed closer to developing a nuclear weapon for self-defense.</p>

          <p>Amid his public feud with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his call to create a new political party, but the endeavor faces daunting challenges. Launching a national party requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often designed to favor the existing two-party system. The process would be extremely time-consuming and expensive, likely costing hundreds of millions of dollars to overcome legal challenges and meet signature requirements. While Musk has the financial resources, experts say building a viable national party by the 2026 midterms is nearly impossible. (not investment advice)</p>

While the pact outlines commitments to neutralize armed groups and foster economic cooperation over the region's vast mineral wealth, the M23 has rejected its binding nature.
