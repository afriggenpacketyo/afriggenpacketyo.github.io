        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's August export growth reached a six-month low of 4.4% year-on-year, missing economists' predictions, as businesses front-loaded less to avoid U.S. tariffs. Imports also grew less than expected, signaling weak domestic demand exacerbated by a persistent real estate slump and job insecurity. While China diversifies to markets like Southeast Asia and the EU, the U.S. remains its largest single trading partner. Ongoing trade tensions and U.S. scrutiny over transshipments pose future challenges for Chinese exports. Goldman Sachs anticipates moderately negative CPI and deeply negative PPI inflation, reflecting underlying economic pressures despite some policy efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese stocks, including the Nikkei 225 and Topix, experienced a significant jump following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, driven by investor optimism regarding potential successors. Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae are prominent contenders, with Takaichi's stance on deregulation and opposition to interest rate hikes particularly noted for its potential to stimulate growth. However, the Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields rose, reflecting ongoing concerns about persistent inflation and broader fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of extended political instability for Japan as the new leadership transition progresses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian woman Erin Patterson, dubbed the "mushroom murderer," has been sentenced to life in prison with a 33-year non-parole period for the triple murder of her estranged husband's parents and aunt. She poisoned them with death cap mushrooms during a beef Wellington lunch in 2023, and was also convicted of attempting to murder the fourth guest, Ian Wilkinson, who survived. Patterson continues to deny intent, leaving the motive a mystery despite her conviction. The case, which drew immense public and media attention, saw Wilkinson urge her to confess and accept his forgiveness.</p>

The fan had reportedly smacked both players on their helmets as they neared the field barrier. Although no penalty was called for the incident, Jackson quickly collected himself on the Ravens' bench. The event underscored a recurring concern in professional sports regarding fan behavior and the physical interaction between spectators and athletes during games, prompting discussion among commentators about the boundaries of fan conduct.</p>

The company simultaneously unveiled Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, envisioning "robotic butlers" becoming a reality within five years. While acknowledging current limitations compared to generative AI, Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian anticipates significant advancements, including ChatGPT 3.5-type capabilities, within the next year. The startup is already generating revenue from sales to schools and hotels, with plans for an initial public offering next year and a goal to reduce consumer robot prices to around $10,000 within three to five years.

          <p>Hakyung Lee is currently on trial in New Zealand, facing charges for the alleged murders of her two children, Minu Jo, aged 6, and Yuna Jo, aged 8, in June 2018. The children's remains were tragically discovered inside luggage within an abandoned storage unit in Auckland in August 2022, leading to Lee's extradition from South Korea. She has pleaded not guilty, and the trial is expected to last four weeks, with prosecutors planning to call 40 witnesses. While the exact cause of death remains unconfirmed, forensic investigators found prescription sleeping medication prescribed to Lee in their bodies, and the court will also consider her mental state at the time of the alleged killings.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes detected by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unveiled the unexpected presence of a solid inner core within Mars. This core measures approximately 600 kilometers in radius, representing about 18% of Mars's total radius, a proportion similar to Earth's inner core. The discovery challenges previous assumptions that Mars had not cooled enough to form a solid inner core, a process that typically requires immense pressure and low temperatures. This finding could also rekindle the long-standing debate about whether Earth was unique in developing plate tectonics, offering new perspectives on planetary geology.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly urged foreign companies investing in the United States to "respect our Nation’s Immigration Laws" and focus on hiring and training American workers. His comments came after a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor manufacturing facility in Georgia, which resulted in the detention of nearly 500 workers, including around 300 South Koreans. Trump, while acknowledging he would review the incident, maintained that it had not damaged his relationship with South Korea. The raid, the largest of its kind under his administration, has strained diplomatic and economic ties, prompting a firm stance from the President on immigration compliance.</p>

This situation stems from President Emmanuel Macron's ill-fated snap election call in 2024, which resulted in a weakened minority government.

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet in Lowestoft, Suffolk, having been entirely unaware of her pregnancy. This rare occurrence, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects approximately one in 2,500 births, where mothers exhibit no discernible symptoms. Robinson had no missed periods or felt fetal movement, attributing existing hip pain to a previous childbirth. The dramatic birth, which happened during a football match, was assisted by family members and an off-duty paramedic. The couple named their son Henry James in memory of a family friend to whom the match was dedicated, adding a poignant layer to the miraculous event.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams clinched a 14-9 season-opening victory against the Houston Texans, propelled by a critical defensive play from new linebacker and team captain Nate Landman. In the game's final minutes, with the Texans poised to score, Landman expertly punched the ball free from a running back, leading to a recovery by lineman Braden Fiske and effectively securing the win. Quarterback Matthew Stafford also reached a career milestone, becoming the 10th player in NFL history to surpass 60,000 passing yards. Despite the offense requiring some adjustments, the Rams' defense, which also recorded an interception and multiple sacks, showcased a dominant performance, contributing significantly to the team's promising start.</p>

          <p>This article delves into "living apart together" (LAT) relationships, featuring the story of Margaret and Peter, a couple who have maintained a happy marriage for 15 years despite residing on different continents. Margaret, who moved to London from Australia to pursue a new career after completing her PhD, highlights that consistent and open communication is fundamental to their relationship's success. While acknowledging the disadvantages, such as occasional loneliness for Peter and a lack of constant companionship for herself, both partners find that this arrangement fosters independence and enriches their individual lives. The article notes that while LAT is uncommon for married couples, its adoption by some high-profile figures underscores its potential as a viable model for committed partnerships seeking autonomy.</p>

BofA identifies significant stimulus potential and robust tech competition in Asia, where stock valuations are seen as more favorable compared to the pricier U.S. market.

Astrophysicists explain that this red appearance is a result of sunlight being reflected and scattered through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more readily than longer red ones. While Asia, including India and China, offered the prime viewing locations, observers in Europe and Africa also caught a glimpse of a partial eclipse during the early evening moonrise.</p>

Animal smuggling poses severe threats, including endangering already vulnerable species, destabilizing local ecosystems, and potentially disrupting human food supplies through the introduction of invasive species.
