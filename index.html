          <p>Germany has secured a spot in the Euro 2025 semifinals after a dramatic 6-5 penalty shootout win against France. The German team demonstrated remarkable resilience, playing with only ten players for over 100 minutes following an early red card for Kathrin Hendrich. Despite falling behind to a penalty, Germany equalized before the match went into extra time and eventually to the decisive shootout. Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger became the hero, saving a crucial penalty after having scored one herself, setting up a semifinal clash with Spain.</p>

          <p>Recent data from several Western countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand, indicates a significant drop in enrollment for Mandarin language courses. Once promoted as the language of the future, its appeal is waning after a period of rapid expansion. In the U.S., university enrollments for Mandarin fell by 25% from their 2013 peak, with similar downward trends observed in Britain and New Zealand. While some European nations still see modest growth, it pales in comparison to the popularity of other languages.</p>

The fight unified the WBA, WBO, WBC, and IBF titles under Usyk once again. Following the win, Usyk expressed a desire to rest and spend time with his family.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken a significant lead at The Open after a strong third-round performance at Royal Portrush. Finishing the day at 14-under par, Scheffler holds a multi-shot advantage heading into the final round. A victory would mark his second major win of the year and place him three-quarters of the way to a career Grand Slam. If he wins, he will join the exclusive company of Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters, PGA Championship, and The Open before turning 30.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This pledge marks the first time a clear numerical goal has been set on the issue, which has caused significant public outcry over waterway pollution. The announcement follows recent data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024 to a record high. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and is part of a broader government effort to reform the water sector amid rising consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Large parts of the United Kingdom are under yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions. While a more severe amber warning for London and the South East on Saturday morning did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible. The Met Office has issued further alerts for Scotland, Wales, and England through the weekend and into Monday. The threat is heightened because the ground, parched from a recent heatwave, is less able to absorb heavy rainfall.</p>

The article claims the letter included a drawing of a nude woman, which Trump has denied, calling the document a "FAKE."

          <p>The investigation into a blast that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies is now focusing on a potential link to explosives recovered from a Santa Monica apartment. The three deputies, who were part of the bomb squad, were killed Friday while handling explosive materials at a training facility. On Thursday, the same deputies had responded to a call at the apartment where a resident found a bag of grenades in a storage unit. Authorities are now trying to determine if those were the same explosives that caused the fatal explosion.</p>

          <p>According to a regulatory filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 company shares on Friday, with the transaction valued at approximately $12.94 million. This sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker. The immense demand for Nvidia's GPUs has caused its market capitalization to soar past $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company and significantly increasing Huang's personal net worth.

          <p>The defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, allege that the Manhattan District Attorney's office illegally obtained his confidential medical records. They claim prosecutors used a "fraudulent subpoena" to compel Aetna to turn over the protected information in violation of health privacy laws. The defense is requesting a hearing and sanctions, potentially including dismissal of the charges. The DA's office sources contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent the additional materials in error, which were then deleted.</p>

          <p>Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa sanctions on a Brazilian Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The US action targets Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who recently ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor. President Lula described the sanctions as "unacceptable" interference in another nation's justice system and a violation of sovereignty. This move by the Trump administration represents the latest escalation in tensions between the two countries over the legal proceedings against Bolsonaro.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested at demonstrations across the United Kingdom protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protests took place in London, Bristol, Manchester, and other cities, with many arrests made under the Terrorism Act for displaying placards in support of the banned group. The government proscribed Palestine Action earlier this month, making it a criminal offense to be a member or show support for the group. The ban followed a break-in at an RAF base for which the group claimed responsibility.</p>

          <p>Former major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's handling of slow play during the third round of The Open at Royal Portrush. Both golfers were spoken to by rules officials in separate incidents after their groups were warned for being over the allotted time. Stenson described the enforcement as "inconsistent," noting the stark difference between long rounds on the first two days and the sudden pressure on Saturday. DeChambeau advocated for a new system where every player's shot is timed individually, arguing the current approach is unfair.</p>

          <p>According to witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza, Israeli forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking food, killing 32 people near distribution hubs run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The incidents occurred as people gathered to receive aid amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after a group approached its troops and is investigating casualty reports. The GHF, which has been a source of chaotic and sometimes deadly aid distribution, denied the incidents occurred at or near its sites.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault on Ukraine overnight, firing over 300 drones and more than 30 cruise missiles, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The attacks killed at least one person in the port city of Odesa, where a residential building caught fire, and damaged critical infrastructure in the northeastern Sumy region. This barrage is part of an intensified bombing campaign by Russia, which is now frequently using a high volume of drones in single attacks. The attacks underscore the ongoing intensity of the war, now in its fourth year.</p>
