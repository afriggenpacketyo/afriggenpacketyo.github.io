          <p>Clean-up operations are in progress across the UK, particularly in Scotland, after Storm Floris caused significant disruption. The storm, described as the most damaging in recent memory, left approximately 50,000 homes without power and led to widespread travel cancellations, including over 100 incidents on Scotland's rail network. While a yellow weather warning remains in place, authorities are working to restore services and power, with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks providing free food and drinks in affected areas. The Scottish government is coordinating the recovery, urging caution as teams work to clear debris and assess damages.</p>

          <p>The United States is launching a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 to enter the country. The temporary rule targets visitors from nations with high visa overstay rates or insufficient security screening, aiming to assess the feasibility of such a system and encourage foreign governments to improve compliance. Consular officers will have discretion in setting the bond amount based on individual circumstances.

          <p>Thirty years after 'Operation Storm,' Croatia and Serbia maintain deeply divided interpretations of the pivotal 1995 military offensive. In Croatia, the event is celebrated as a heroic victory that recaptured territory and was crucial to ending the Yugoslav wars, marked by a large military parade in Zagreb. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic 'pogrom' that led to the mass exodus and murder of around 200,000 ethnic Serbs, with President Aleksandar Vucic lamenting it as a great injustice. The differing narratives highlight the persistent ethnic and political tensions that remain in the region three decades later.</p>

          <p>UK news is currently focused on a controversy involving Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who accused police of a 'cover-up' regarding the immigration status of two men in a child sexual assault case. His comments have drawn sharp criticism, with a Labour MP accusing him of 'fanning the flames of hate,' while also prompting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to call for greater transparency from authorities. In other news, the Metropolitan Police are preparing for potential mass detentions at a pro-Palestine rally, and an analysis suggests wealthy parents have prepaid private school fees to avoid a new VAT tax.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting in Geneva to negotiate a global treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution, a crisis that has seen trillions of plastic pieces accumulate in the world's oceans. The talks follow a two-year period where no agreement was reached on key issues, such as cutting single-use plastic production and banning harmful chemicals. A major point of contention exists between nearly 100 countries advocating for production limits and a group of oil-producing nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, who favor focusing on recycling. Experts warn of the grave health and environmental impacts if no action is taken.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Rejection of Jobs Report Follows Pattern of Discrediting Unfavorable Data</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's recent dismissal of a disappointing July jobs report as 'phony' and the subsequent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner is consistent with his long-standing practice of discrediting data that reflects poorly on him. This pattern includes challenging election results, altering weather maps, and downplaying COVID-19 case numbers by suggesting less testing. Critics, including economists and public interest groups, argue this strategy erodes trust in government institutions and can lead to poor policy decisions based on manipulated information. The White House maintains its focus is on ensuring data accuracy, citing the large revisions in the report as a credibility issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Poland is rapidly sliding back towards right-wing populism, less than two years after the ousting of the Law and Justice party. The new liberal democratic government, led by Donald Tusk, has failed to deliver on key promises like liberalizing abortion laws and has adopted some of its predecessors' nationalist rhetoric, leading to a collapse in public support. This situation serves as a cautionary tale, suggesting that simply defeating populists at the ballot box is insufficient. Without a compelling, forward-looking vision, liberal governments risk becoming mere interludes in a longer populist era.</p>

Despite some other global militaries moving away from this type of aircraft for modern warfare, Beijing seems committed to the strategy. The blurry images provide the first public clues about the capabilities of this new addition to China's air force, which will enhance its surveillance and command functions.</p>

India also pointed out that the EU and U.S. themselves continue to trade with Russia.

This partially grants a challenge brought by the ACLU, which argued the policy violated U.S. and international law.

          <p>Communities across the United States are facing a critical shortage of volunteer firefighters, a workforce that comprises nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews. The number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout and strained resources. This decline threatens the safety of smaller communities and could force more towns to switch to paid departments, a move that would significantly increase taxpayer costs. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment and ensure this vital civil service can continue to operate effectively.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial where he faces allegations of plotting a coup. The judge presiding over the case, Alexandre de Moraes, stated the decision was made because Bolsonaro had violated previous restraining orders by using allies' social media to encourage attacks on the judiciary. Bolsonaro is now banned from receiving most visitors and using a phone. The ruling has been condemned by the U.S. State Department, and Donald Trump has used the trial as a justification for imposing tariffs on some Brazilian goods.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters skyrocketed on Monday after President Trump praised the retailer's controversial advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a Truth Social post, Trump called the ad the 'HOTTEST' out there and encouraged his followers to support the brand, sparking a meme-driven rally. The ad had previously drawn criticism from some who claimed its 'great genes/jeans' wordplay promoted eugenics, a charge the company denies. The presidential endorsement provided a significant boost to the retailer, which has recently faced financial challenges, including slow sales and a major write-off of merchandise.

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's critical energy supplies would be exhausted rapidly in the event of a military blockade by Beijing. Based on war-gaming scenarios, the analysis found that Taiwan's natural gas reserves would last only 11 days, coal for seven weeks, and oil for 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests a blockade would not be a low-risk option for China, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. This aggressive action would also alert other nations and deplete Chinese assets needed for a potential invasion.</p>

The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include 11 awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace the winners, particularly those who were gifted bonds or only have old paper records. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of winners and offers a tracing service, some find the process too difficult, especially during a cost-of-living crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has become a cultural flashpoint after being praised by Donald Trump. The controversy stems from the ad's wordplay, where Sweeney discusses how 'genes' are passed down before stating her 'jeans are blue.' Some critics on social media interpreted this as an echo of eugenics rhetoric, while others defended it as an innocuous pun. American Eagle has maintained the campaign was always about denim. The debate intensified after Trump endorsed the ad and Sweeney, whom he called a 'registered Republican,' causing the company's stock to surge significantly.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is warning hunters after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found with blue-dyed fat and muscle tissue. Lab tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide. The pigs were likely exposed by either directly consuming the bait or eating other animals that had. The CDFW is urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target species from accessing bait and is advising hunters to avoid consuming any game animal with discolored tissue, as contamination may not always be visible.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for that age group. Following updated guidelines, screening rates among adults aged 45 to 49 rose by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a jump in the annual incidence rate of early-stage cancer diagnoses, which researchers say is promising news as it indicates cancers are being caught sooner. However, experts caution that screening uptake in this younger demographic remains suboptimal and inequitable across different insurance and education levels.</p>
