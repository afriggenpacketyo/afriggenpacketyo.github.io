          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu is reportedly contemplating military action against Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, creating friction with the U.S. government. This disagreement has resulted in tense discussions between President Trump and Netanyahu, as well as meetings between top officials from both countries. Israel fears that Trump's eagerness for a deal might lead to Iran maintaining its uranium enrichment capabilities, a scenario Netanyahu opposes. The article details past Israeli actions against Iran's nuclear infrastructure and the differing perspectives on how to best address Iran's nuclear program, highlighting the delicate diplomacy involved. The White House declined to comment, while Netanyahu's office dismissed the article as "fake news."</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are forging a stronger alliance in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the U.S.'s desire to lead the global AI race and the UAE's ambition to become a technological powerhouse. The UAE possesses abundant cheap energy crucial for powering AI data centers, while the U.S. boasts advanced semiconductor chips, making their partnership mutually beneficial. Recent deals, including the Stargate Project, signify substantial investments and collaborations between American tech companies and Abu Dhabi. The article emphasizes that this alliance positions the UAE as a key player in the AI landscape, potentially serving emerging markets with AI solutions, and reflects a strategic shift in the U.S.-Gulf relationship towards compute and AI rather than solely focusing on crude oil.</p>

          <p>David McBride, an Australian whistleblower who leaked classified documents about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, has lost his appeal to reduce his prison sentence. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's argument that he acted in the public interest by leaking the documents. McBride's lawyers expressed outrage at the decision and plan to challenge it in the High Court, asserting that exposing a crime should not be a crime. Rights groups have criticized the prosecution, noting that McBride is the only person imprisoned over the alleged war crimes committed by Australian special forces troops in Afghanistan.

          <p>Getty Images is investing millions in its legal battle against Stability AI, accusing the company of using copyrighted material without permission to train its AI models for commercial purposes. Getty CEO Craig Peters argues that Stability AI and other AI labs are essentially stealing copyrighted material under the guise of innovation. He contends that this constitutes unfair competition and theft, as these firms are profiting by using copyrighted works to develop AI models that directly compete in existing commercial markets. The article highlights Getty's broader concern that the AI industry's arguments against paying for creative works could undermine the value of intellectual property and creative rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind as long-dated yields rise. Higher Japanese government bond yields could prompt Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. Some analysts warn of a possible "Armageddon" scenario, with rising yields strengthening the yen and negatively impacting U.S. tech stocks and global markets due to increased borrowing costs. However, other analysts suggest that the carry trade impact may be gradual due to a less apparent advantage in shorting the yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce reveals that European businesses' optimism about growth and profitability in China has reached a record low. This pessimism is driven by economic downturns and rising geopolitical tensions, even before the intensification of the China-US trade war. The survey indicates that only 29% of respondents are optimistic about their growth prospects in China over the next two years, while a record-high 49% expressed pessimism.

Nearly three-quarters of the surveyed companies reported worsening business conditions, and the proportion planning to expand operations in China has fallen to a record low. Despite curbing their own investments, some European businesses are buying more components from Chinese companies, increasing their dependence on China's supply chains.

The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a SARS-CoV-2 variant under monitoring, noting its increasing proportions globally. Though the variant appears to be more transmissible, current data suggests that it does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, and currently-approved Covid shots are expected to remain effective against it.</p>

Skomer's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, making it an ideal breeding ground for seabirds.
