        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. intelligence report, issued the same day as President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, assessed that Iran could potentially develop a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, although there was no indication that Iran had decided to do so. The summary also noted discussions among Iranian officials about concealing highly enriched uranium in public places to prevent its destruction. Iran has been increasing its enriched uranium stockpiles, raising concerns among international observers, and has reached a purity level of 60%, close to the 90% needed for weapons. The U.S. airstrikes targeted uranium enrichment and research sites after Israel alleged Iran was developing a nuclear bomb. The assessment of the damage to the sites is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>Karmelo Anthony, the 18-year-old suspect in the stabbing death of Austin Metcalf at a Frisco, Texas track meet, has been indicted on a first-degree murder charge. The incident occurred during a dispute at Memorial High School, where Anthony allegedly stabbed Metcalf, who died in his twin brother's arms. Anthony's attorney claims he acted in self-defense, while Metcalf's father expresses hope for justice but acknowledges it won't bring his son back. Anthony, who was initially held on a $1 million bond, was later released to home confinement after the bond was reduced to $250,000, and the trial date is yet to be set.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs to participate in NATO's airborne nuclear mission. These jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, marking a significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear capabilities. The use of nuclear weapons would require authorization from NATO's nuclear planning group, the US president, and the British prime minister. This move has been lauded by Prime Minister Starmer as an investment in national security during an era of radical uncertainty, with the aim of supporting businesses and jobs across the country.</p>

          <p>Following the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran's retaliatory attack on a U.S. air base in Qatar, the FBI is increasing its focus and resources on counterterrorism threats, including domestic threats. A memo was sent to FBI field offices instructing them to prioritize resources on terror threats, aligning with an earlier report forecasting a need to concentrate on Iran. The FBI is also addressing internal complaints about agents being reassigned from counterterrorism to immigration enforcement, amidst heightened terrorism concerns and warnings of a heightened threat environment due to the Iran conflict. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding after a period of intense exchange.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An early intelligence assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that the recent U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, contradicting President Trump's claim of complete obliteration. The assessment, which was shared with select senators, revealed limited damage to critical infrastructure, particularly at the Fordo facility. Iranian officials have stated they will continue their uranium enrichment activities, disregarding demands to halt the process, while experts suggest Iran's nuclear knowledge is difficult to eliminate entirely. The White House has disputed the assessment, maintaining that a key nuclear facility was destroyed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release documents, photos, and internal reports detailing the military's activities in Southern California, granting a procedural victory to the state in its effort to limit the deployment of troops. The ruling authorizes California lawyers to depose key administration officials regarding the duration of troop deployment under federal control. This decision follows a previous appellate court ruling that deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program, is not linked to a diplomatic agreement on the program's future. Without a diplomatic agreement, Iran may end cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, potentially leading to covert nuclear weapon development. The situation draws parallels to North Korea's past actions. The article suggests that Trump should have used the moment to negotiate a deal with Iran that included inspections and limits on its nuclear program.</p>

Experts warn that extreme heat poses a particular risk to children and people with existing health issues, and that people should take precautions.</p>
