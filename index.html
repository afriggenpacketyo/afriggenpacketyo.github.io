          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family to be used as Air Force One, raising potential legal and ethical concerns. The plane, estimated to cost around $400 million, would be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the end of his second term. White House officials state that any gift from a foreign government is accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. This move comes as Trump has expressed frustration over delays and cost overruns in modernizing the current Air Force One aircraft, potentially costing over $2 billion, with completion not expected until at least 2027.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the recent trade agreement with China signifies progress in the U.S.'s strategic decoupling from reliance on Chinese products. The agreement involves a temporary pause in reciprocal tariffs, though a 10% tariff will remain in effect, as well as a 20% charge related to fentanyl. Bessent emphasized that the U.S. aims for decoupling in strategic necessities, such as critical medicines and semiconductors, highlighting lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic about resilient supply chains. The U.S. imported nearly $440 billion in goods from China in 2024, resulting in a $295.4 billion trade deficit.</p>

          <p>Celebrity musicians, including Elton John and Dua Lipa, are urging the U.K. government to reconsider plans to reform copyright laws related to AI, which would allow AI developers to access rights-protected content. An open letter signed by numerous high-profile artists calls on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support an amendment that would make the legal framework around AI model makers' use of copyrighted content more strict. The current proposals would require artists to opt out of having their copyrighted works scraped by large language models, a move the artists argue places the onus unfairly on content creators. The letter emphasizes the need for transparency and licensing regimes to protect human-created content.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a temporary reduction in tariffs, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war, which has been a primary driver of market volatility. The agreement, reached after weekend talks, involves the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower import duties on American goods to 10% from 125% for a 90-day period. This news led to a surge in stock markets worldwide and strengthened the U.S. dollar. Economists have warned that the trade tensions significantly increased the possibility of an economic downturn, and the World Trade Organization has forecast that the division of the global economy into rival blocs could cut global GDP by nearly 7% over the long run.</p>

          <p>As President Trump travels to the Middle East, the U.S.'s dominance in AI chips has become a key source of leverage in securing strategic bonds with oil-rich nations. Governments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the U.A.E. are eager to invest billions in data centers, requiring U.S.-designed AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD. The Trump administration appears more willing to use access to these chips as a bargaining chip, potentially linking it to trade talks and investments in the U.S. This approach contrasts with the Biden administration's stricter export controls aimed at limiting China's access to AI technology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed in recent months, marking a breakthrough in trade negotiations. The two countries will reduce reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods effectively reduced to about 30% and China's tariffs on American imports lowered to 10%. The previous high tariffs had virtually frozen trade between the U.S. and China, causing major American ports to report a drastic drop in traffic. This move is expected to buoy global financial markets and commodities, indicating a potential shift away from protectionist trade policies.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing trial in New York City on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, accused of running a criminal enterprise that manipulated women into participating in commercial sexual assault acts since at least 2004. The trial is expected to feature testimony from an FBI analyst, a male escort, and singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend. Ventura's lawsuit against Combs, which included allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse, was settled out of court, but a 2016 video of Combs attacking Ventura in a hotel hallway is expected to be a key piece of evidence. Combs has denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by the Trump administration has arrived in the U.S. amid ongoing tensions between the two countries. The U.S. has criticized South African domestic policy, alleging discrimination against white farmers, while South Africa has dismissed these accusations as unfounded and politically motivated. The group of 49 refugees is expected to settle in Texas. President Trump's administration has faced criticism for its openness to accepting Afrikaner refugees while simultaneously cracking down on migrants and asylum seekers from other countries.</p>

While neither Beijing nor New Delhi has confirmed the use of Chinese weapons, U.S. officials have verified that at least two Indian fighter jets were hit. This incident may strain the detente between China and India, who had recently agreed to end their military stand-off at the Himalayan border.

          <p>When children face difficulties, taking away their passions can be counterproductive; instead, parents should identify and nurture their strengths, or “islands of competence”. Research suggests strength-based parenting correlates with lower stress and higher school engagement, while focusing on weaknesses can negatively affect confidence. Confidence gained in one area can carry over to others, enabling young people to persevere through obstacles. Parents can identify, name, build on, and use these strengths to address weaknesses, fostering a positive sense of self and helping children realize their potential.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal seeks to cut $163 billion from education, housing, and health programs, primarily affecting lower-income Americans. The proposal aims to overhaul the social safety net by changing how aid is distributed, such as converting rental assistance into block grants. These changes would give states more flexibility in spending but could reduce direct benefits to renters. The proposal also includes a $4 billion cut to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps families cover heating and cooling bills, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences for some families. Despite the budget's unlikely passage, it signals the administration's intent to reshape social programs.</p>

          <p>While Donald Trump may portray the temporary truce in the US-China trade war as a victory, financial markets view it as a capitulation.

This marks a significant shift in trade terms since before Trump's presidency but falls short of a trade embargo.
