          <p>The "48 Hours" program investigates the case of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after three trials. The article details the investigation, including Chandler's history of stalking Sisco, her inconsistent alibis, and secret recordings made by her daughter. Despite a lack of direct physical evidence, prosecutors built a case based on circumstantial evidence and Chandler's behavior. The initial conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, but after a retrial in 2025, Chandler was again found guilty, bringing a sense of closure to the victims' families after decades of searching for justice.</p>

          <p>A history buff's metal detecting hobby led to the rediscovery of a lost medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden. GÃ¶ran Bengtsson noticed a peculiar rectangle symbol labeled "Klosterkullen" (monastery hill) on an 18th-century map. Archaeologists confirmed the site using ground-penetrating radar, revealing the walls of monastery ruins. The find, dating back to the late 1100s, may be the original location of Ã…s Abbey, later moved in the 13th century, and the discovery has surprised experts.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players are increasingly expressing concerns about the unsustainable physical demands of the current tennis calendar. Alex de Minaur cited burnout as a reason for his early French Open exit, while Jack Draper and Iga Swiatek have also voiced concerns about the mental and physical toll. Casper Ruud criticized the rankings "rat race," and de Minaur suggested players' careers will be shortened due to mental exhaustion.

          <p>China is grappling with public discontent over the reinstatement and promotion of officials who were previously disciplined for misconduct. The case of Xie Qin, a Communist Party cadre disciplined for a drinking spree and now up for promotion, has sparked debate. This practice is part of Beijing's effort to motivate officials amid an anti-corruption campaign and economic challenges, but it is largely unpopular among the public, who view it as rewarding misbehavior.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a significant increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe with 66.8% of the population affected, which experts attribute to factors like poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation limits access to nutritious options, and the consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks is on the rise. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue it overlooks broader economic struggles and lacks adequate guidelines for healthy eating. The article suggests that addressing poverty and regulating the food industry are crucial steps in tackling the issue.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential runoff election that presents a stark ideological choice between a pro-European liberal, Rafal Trzaskowski, and a staunch nationalist, Karol Nawrocki.

          <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's inconsistent and aggressive approach towards China, combined with his perceived weakness, increases the likelihood of conflict over Taiwan. Trump's trade policies and pressure on China's economy are seen as provocative, while his isolationist tendencies and reluctance to defend key allies undermine US credibility. This combination of aggression and cowardice creates a dangerous situation where China may be emboldened to challenge the status quo, potentially leading to a crisis over Taiwan.</p>
