          <p>A shooting incident at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and two injuries. The victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. Authorities have arrested a 23-year-old suspect, Hunter Nadeau, who was charged with second-degree murder, with additional charges expected. According to law enforcement, there is no known connection between the suspect and the victims. Eyewitnesses at a wedding reception in an adjacent room described how the suspect, after being hit with a chair, ran through their event before being apprehended, causing widespread panic among the guests.</p>

          <p>Great Britain's athletics team concluded the World Athletics Championships in Japan without a single gold medal for the first time in 22 years. The team secured a total of five medals, marking one of its lowest returns since 2005 and finishing 21st in the overall standings. This performance stands in stark contrast to their success at the previous championships and the recent Olympics. Head coach Paula Dunn acknowledged the mixed results, citing both successes and missed opportunities, and called for a thorough review to plan for the future. Former athletes expressed disappointment, particularly with the relay teams failing to medal for the first time since 2003.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned public criticism from U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner as an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." Kushner had accused Macron's government of inaction against rising antisemitism and linked French foreign policy, such as recognizing a Palestinian state, to endangering Jewish life. Macron firmly rejected these claims, stating that disagreeing with the Israeli government's policies does not equate to antisemitism and that a diplomat's role is not to make such public rebukes. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned the ambassador, citing an obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of other states.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially announced their recognition of a Palestinian state. The leaders of the three nations framed the decision as a necessary step to advance a two-state solution and build momentum for lasting peace, explicitly stating it is not a reward for Hamas. This symbolic but historic decision has been met with strong opposition from both the United States and Israel, who argue it legitimizes Hamas. The move aligns these Western powers with over 140 other countries that already recognize Palestine, signaling a significant shift in international policy.</p>

          <h2>Study Identifies Nine Key Practices of Parents Raising Children with Strong Social Skills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:23:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children develop exceptional social skills when their parents model specific behaviors from an early age. The research highlights nine key practices, including openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, these methods build a foundation of emotional safety and connection.

In the book, she explains that she left the marriage not from a lack of love, but because she needed to find her own identity outside of being Elvis's wife. The memoir covers her journey into business and acting, her role in preserving Graceland as a public landmark, and her relationships with her children, Lisa Marie and Navarone. Presley reflects on the immense pressures of her life with the King of Rock and Roll and the profound grief following the recent death of her daughter, Lisa Marie.</p>

          <p>Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has stated that the United States is facing a perilous moment, accusing President Donald Trump of using the federal government to punish political adversaries. Murphy specifically cited threats to have the FCC reexamine broadcast licenses for critical media outlets as an attempt to silence dissent, a practice he compared to those of repressive authoritarian regimes. He argued that while politicians often take issue with media coverage, using the coercive and regulatory power of government to enforce compliance is illegal and fundamentally un-American.

Rick Harrison of "Pawn Stars" fame noted this evolution, comparing it to changing culinary tastes over time. Major casinos like the Rio and Aria have replaced their once-famous buffets with concepts like the Canteen Food Hall and Proper Eats Food Hall. Harrison, who owns a barbecue restaurant, sees this as a natural shift, emphasizing that Vegas still offers a wide range of dining options for every budget, from traditional American steaks to diverse food court selections, despite recent drops in tourism.</p>

          <p>As annual fees for premium credit cards rise, a credit expert outlines three common mistakes consumers make that prevent them from getting the full value of their rewards. The first is opting for no-fee cards, which typically offer inferior rewards compared to cards with modest fees. Another major error is hoarding points, as their value can be devalued by issuers at any time. Finally, consumers often fail to negotiate with their card issuers; calling the retention department when considering cancellation can often result in fee discounts or bonus points. The expert stresses aligning your card choice with your lifestyle and spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent move by the UK, Canada, and Australia to recognize a Palestinian state highlights a critical and unresolved issue: who would govern it. The Palestinian territories are geographically and politically divided, with the Palestinian Authority administering parts of the West Bank and Hamas controlling Gaza. Palestinian politics have been stagnant for years, with no national elections since 2006, leading to widespread cynicism about the current leadership. While recognition is a significant symbolic step, analysts point out that without a unified, functioning government and defined territory, the practical implementation of statehood remains an immense challenge amid ongoing conflict and internal divisions.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between the role of women in Nazi Germany and the rhetoric surrounding women in contemporary right-wing American politics. It argues that authoritarian strongmen often rely on women to uphold traditional domestic duties—the "cradle and the ladle"—to implement state ideology at the family level. The analysis points to the rise of the online "womanosphere," where influencers promote traditional homemaking, which can serve as a pipeline to more extreme ideologies that subordinate women's autonomy to national and family duties.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, has called Elon Musk a "criminal" and accused him of inciting violence and failing to regulate harmful content on his social media platform, X. Davey cited adverts on the platform related to self-harm and child sexual abuse, calling for a regulatory investigation into both Musk and his company. The sharp criticism follows Musk's video message to a far-right rally in London, where he told protesters to "fight back or you die." The Liberal Democrats are now planning to table a motion in Parliament to summon Musk to be held accountable for his actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested from its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The firm initially invested $230 million in 2008 at the urging of Charlie Munger, a stake that grew exponentially in value over 17 years. Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022 and has now confirmed that the position, held by its energy subsidiary, is valued at zero. While Buffett has praised BYD as an "extraordinary company," the sale aligns with a broader reevaluation of geopolitical risks associated with Chinese investments, similar to Berkshire's quick exit from Taiwan Semiconductor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many women are reportedly ill-informed about their own reproductive biology, leading fertility doctors and other experts to call for more comprehensive sex education in schools. They argue that curriculums should cover not only pregnancy prevention but also the basics of fertility, such as how age, lifestyle, and health factors impact the ability to conceive. Surveys show that many women lack knowledge about ovulation and the decline in egg quality over time, which can lead to misconceptions about their chances of getting pregnant later in life. Proponents believe that early education could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning and potentially avoid future fertility struggles.</p>

          <p>In a discussion for The Atlantic, staff writer Anne Applebaum and Russian pro-democracy advocate Garry Kasparov analyze the rising threat of autocracy in the United States under President Trump. They draw parallels between the administration's pressure on media, such as the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, and Vladimir Putin's early moves to silence satirical programs in Russia. Kasparov and Applebaum argue that modern censorship often works through corporate and political pressure rather than direct state control. They express grave concern that American institutions, particularly Congress, are failing to provide the necessary checks and balances, making the 2026 midterm elections a critical battlefield for the future of U.S. democracy.</p>

This trend is forcing consumers to carefully evaluate whether the perks offered are worth the significant cost. Experts advise that these cards are generally not a good value for individuals who carry a balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards earned. To determine a card's worth, consumers should assess their personal travel habits, brand loyalty, and whether benefits like free checked bags, lounge access, and travel credits will outweigh the hefty annual fee.

Critics, including the Refugee Council and Oxford University, have called the policy "excessively harsh" and urged the government to reconsider, arguing that no one should be forced to choose between their education and their family's safety. The rules are part of a broader crackdown on immigration that restricts most international students from bringing dependents.</p>
