          <p>A shooting incident in a Midtown Manhattan office building on Park Avenue resulted in the deaths of three people, including an off-duty police officer who was working a security detail. According to sources, the suspect, armed with a long gun, barricaded himself on the 33rd floor before being found deceased from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. The building, which houses the headquarters for Blackstone and the National Football League, was placed on lockdown during the active shooter investigation. Authorities have advised people to avoid the area as the investigation into the motive and circumstances of the attack continues.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced daily 10-hour "tactical pauses" in fighting in specific parts of Gaza to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This decision comes amid mounting international pressure and warnings of a severe hunger crisis, with images of malnourished children drawing global criticism. While the United Nations and other aid agencies have welcomed the move, they stress that a broader ceasefire is essential to address the catastrophic conditions effectively. Hamas officials have dismissed the measure as a public relations effort, while Israel maintains it will continue its offensive against the group in other areas of the territory.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will impose a 15% tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase from previous levels. In return, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion by 2028, while facing no new tariffs on its exports to the U.S. Some economists describe the deal as "asymmetric," predicting it will negatively impact the EU's GDP, while the Trump administration touts it as a major win for American manufacturers and farmers. The deal is seen as a way to reduce trade uncertainty, though it is expected to increase costs for U.S. consumers on European goods like wine and cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman killed three people and injured three others during a shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino in Reno, Nevada. The incident began when the suspect opened fire on a group in the valet area, killing two and injuring three, before moving through the parking lot. He then fatally shot a sixth victim and exchanged gunfire with a security guard and responding police officers. The suspect was wounded by police and is hospitalized in critical condition, with authorities stating there is no known connection between him and the victims. The Sparks Police Department is leading the investigation due to the officer-involved nature of the shooting's conclusion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent visit to his Scottish golf courses provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with significant, informal access to the U.S. leader. The trip, though notionally private, involved public appearances and a lengthy, wide-ranging press conference covering topics from Gaza to trade. This direct engagement is viewed by Downing Street as invaluable for strengthening the UK-US relationship, despite the unpredictable nature of the president's public statements. For Starmer, the visit offered a chance to align on key issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to burnish a crucial diplomatic relationship ahead of a formal state visit.</p>

While Slater reportedly maintains support from some top administration officials, the ousters highlight significant discord within the key office tasked with enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.</p>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking an injunction that would allow him to play for the University of Southern California this season. After transferring to USC for his final year of eligibility, Wingfield's waiver request was denied by the NCAA, which cited its "Five-Year Rule." The lawsuit challenges the legality of this rule, arguing it is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a previous injury. Wingfield claims the NCAA's decision has cost him a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and the chance to enhance his professional prospects by playing for a high-profile program.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's muted reaction to the new U.S.-EU trade deal is due to investors being preoccupied with more immediate concerns. He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting, and forthcoming employment data, which overshadow the tariff announcements. Cramer also points to a sense of "tariff ennui," as investors have seen this pattern before where high tariff threats are negotiated down, and major trade deals with other partners like China are still pending. The market is not expected to react significantly to trade policy until these other major economic events have passed. (not investment advice)</p>

The highly politicized case, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years, stems from a 2012 accusation Uribe made against a left-wing senator.

          <p>Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase is under investigation by Major League Baseball for sports betting, creating a unique financial risk for his supporters. Fans had invested over $315,000 in Clase's future earnings through Finlete, a company that allows people to buy a share in an athlete's career. If Clase is found to have bet on baseball, he could face a suspension of one year to life, which would void his contract and jeopardize any return for his investors. The situation highlights the inherent risks of such novel investment platforms, which are dependent on an athlete's continued performance and good standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a July slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire an outfielder who can provide a significant defensive upgrade, with Minnesota Twins' Harrison Bader emerging as a prime target. While the Dodgers' offense has struggled, the team's priority may be shifting to run prevention to support a potentially dominant playoff pitching staff. Bader, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season, could anchor the outfield defense and allow other players to move to more suitable positions. This potential move signals the team's focus on shoring up all facets of their game ahead of the trade deadline for a deep postseason run.</p>

          <p>Following his death, Hulk Hogan's legal victory against Gawker Media is remembered as a pivotal moment for privacy rights in the digital age. In 2016, a jury awarded Hogan $140 million after Gawker published a secretly recorded sex tape, leading to the outlet's bankruptcy. Legal experts note that while the case didn't set new legal precedent, it served as a powerful cultural statement on the limits of the First Amendment. The verdict demonstrated that even for public figures, the publication of graphic, private material can constitute an invasion of privacy, influencing how media outlets handle sensitive content and empowering individuals in cases of revenge porn.</p>
