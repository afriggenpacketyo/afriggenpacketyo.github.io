        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court has effectively granted President Trump considerable new authority by staying lower court rulings that protected officials from being fired. This decision allows the president to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch, potentially undermining the rule of law. The court's action overrules a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, raising concerns about the consolidation of power in the presidency. The author argues this decision risks emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional order and sets a dangerous precedent. The ruling also enables the president to declare himself above the law, potentially weakening checks on presidential power. The author feels that this decision could have ramifications for a range of high-stakes legal questions currently pending before the courts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," suggesting he has enough support to stall it in the Senate unless significant changes are made. Johnson criticizes the bill for increasing the deficit instead of reducing it, advocating for deeper spending cuts to pre-pandemic levels. The bill faces additional hurdles as some GOP senators oppose raising the debt ceiling within the package, preferring to address it separately. Speaker Johnson defends the bill as a vital investment that will stimulate the economy by reducing taxes and regulations, but Rand Paul calls the spending cuts "wimpy and anemic." The CBO estimates the bill would raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion, but Johnson disputes this claim, citing the bill's potential to foster economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party is struggling with startlingly low approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. The party is losing support among key demographics, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, raising concerns about its future. The article is the first in a series examining the challenges facing the Democratic Party, including internal divisions and a tarnished image. Representative Jason Crow emphasizes the need to reconnect with rural America and working-class voters who have drifted toward the Republican Party. A new effort, code-named SAM, aims to reverse the erosion of Democratic support among young men, especially online, and recommends shifting from a moralizing tone.</p>

          <p>A second major power outage in two days hit southeastern France, this time in Nice, after an electrical facility was damaged by suspected arson. Approximately 45,000 households were left without electricity, and the city's trams stopped, with a brief power cut at Nice CÃ´te d'Azur Airport. Authorities are investigating the incident as a criminal act, with the mayor blaming "malicious acts." This follows a similar power outage in Cannes, leading police to suspect sabotage in both instances. The Nice public prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation for "organized arson."</p>

The Israeli military stated the incident is under review, and that the area was a "dangerous war zone." The Red Cross also reported the deaths of two staff members in a separate strike, highlighting the rising civilian death toll in Gaza.

          <p>Aston Villa plans to file a complaint with the Premier League after a refereeing error contributed to their 2-0 loss against Manchester United, costing them a spot in the Champions League. A disallowed goal, where television footage indicated no foul occurred, and a late penalty awarded to Manchester United fueled the team's frustration. The club is questioning the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial game, implying more seasoned officials should have been chosen. The club's director of football stated that the complaint is about the referee selection rather than the specific decisions themselves, while the manager expressed visible fury with the Rogers disallowed goal.</p>

          <p>Ketamine therapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment for treatment-resistant depression, with some reality stars touting its benefits. While the FDA has approved a ketamine derivative nasal spray for TRD and suicidal ideation, the drug carries risks, including addiction and adverse health issues. Some practices administer ketamine via IV injection alongside psychotherapy, claiming transformative results for clients. Experts caution that ketamine carries a risk of addiction or dependency, and the treatment should be monitored by medical professionals. While ketamine IV therapy could be an alternative option if other treatments havenâ€™t been effective for mental health conditions, experts urge caution.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing deportation. The officer, Leslie O'Neal, initially accused Ximena Arias-Cristobal of an improper turn, but the charges were later dropped. However, the arrest triggered her detention by ICE due to her immigration status, sparking national attention and criticism. The incident has highlighted the impact of local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE under 287(g) contracts, which deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement. The teenager has since been released on bond, and her attorney is working to secure her permanent residency.</p>

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly in liquefied natural gas (LNG). Japanese public financial institutions provided $93 billion for oil and gas projects between 2013 and 2024, while investing significantly less in clean energy projects. This investment in LNG is part of Japan's strategy to secure energy supplies and resell surplus LNG to other countries in the Asia Pacific region. At the same time, Japan promotes the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to foster cooperation on net-zero emissions, but many AZEC projects focus on natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage, raising concerns about greenwashing. Critics argue that Japan's LNG investments hinder the transition to renewable energy in Southeast Asia and undermine its climate commitments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emotionally safe parenting is presented as a new approach that prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing in parents. This style involves accepting children's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their full selves. The framework emphasizes doing the inner work to understand one's own emotional triggers, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair.</p>

          <p>Americans across the country are remembering George Floyd on the fifth anniversary of his death, which sparked global protests against racism and police brutality. Events were held in both Houston, where Floyd grew up, and Minneapolis, where he was murdered. Floyd's family gathered in Houston for an event led by Rev. Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis held a church service, candlelight vigil, and gospel concert. Some observers note that the national "reckoning" with racism that followed Floyd's death appears to be fading as President Trump rolls back police reforms in some cities.</p>

The overnight attack saw Russia launch the highest number of drones and missiles in a single night since the war began, killing at least 12 people, including three children, and injuring dozens more. Zelensky warned that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without "strong pressure on the Russian leadership." The article suggests Zelensky is referring to the lack of further sanctions imposed by Washington on Moscow, arguing that the Kremlin is not being incentivized enough to engage in ceasefire talks.</p>
