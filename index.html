          <p>French actor G√©rard Depardieu was found guilty by a Paris court on Tuesday on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a film in 2021, receiving a suspended sentence of 18 months and being placed on a list of sexual offenders.

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% in the January to March period, and the number of employees on company payrolls falling.

Wage growth, while still relatively strong, has slowed down, leading the Bank of England to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts. Analysts suggest that recent increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be contributing to the weakening job market.</p>

          <p>According to a Chinese defence industry newspaper, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) utilized an advanced data sharing system dubbed "ABC" during recent hostilities against Indian forces. This system, described as "locked by A, launched by B, guided by C," integrates ground radars, fighter jets, and airborne warning aircraft for enhanced combat effectiveness. Unlike traditional air combat where a single jet handles all aspects, Pakistan's approach shared real-time data, enabling ground systems to lock onto targets, patrol jets to launch missiles from safe distances, and airborne warning systems to guide the ordnance.</p>

          <p>Despite India's dominance in cricket, its football team lags far behind, struggling to produce young talent and compete internationally. Unlike cricket, football lacks role models and a structured pathway for players to reach the top. The Indian Super League (ISL) faces financial challenges compared to the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL), hindering investment in youth development. While cricket benefits from strong commercial success and a well-structured system, football needs more investment and a focus on grassroots development to nurture future stars.</p>

The research found that many children had other health conditions, such as autism, learning disabilities, or liver disease. Some clinics are using digital technology to support weight loss, while researchers suggest that weight loss injections could be effective for children aged 12 and over.</p>
