          <p>Tesla is set to release its first-quarter earnings amid investor concerns about tariffs and CEO Elon Musk's ties to the White House, which have significantly impacted the stock price. Despite expectations of a slight revenue decline, investors are more focused on future prospects. Musk has attempted to reassure employees about the company's potential in robotics, AI, and autonomous vehicles, while also addressing backlash from his political endorsements. The company faces challenges from proposed tariffs on components sourced from Mexico and China, potentially affecting production costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several companies have announced plans to expand manufacturing in the U.S. following the implementation of new tariffs by the Trump administration, although not all directly cite tariffs as the primary motivator. Economists are skeptical that tariffs alone are enough to spur such shifts, noting factors like labor costs, energy costs, and political stability play a larger role. Goldman Sachs economists suggest broad-based tariffs may have negative net employment effects. Companies like Apple, Chobani, and Nvidia are making significant investments to boost domestic production, aiming to capitalize on American innovation and meet growing demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has sparked concerns about the Fed's independence and potential attempts to influence monetary policy. Analysts suggest that even firing Powell might not be enough to achieve the desired rate cuts, as the FOMC could still vote against Trump's preferences.

Public anger is erupting at town halls across the country, with constituents confronting lawmakers on issues like tariffs, immigration, and budget cuts. In deep-red states, Republican representatives face boos and demands for accountability.

          <p>A new ceasefire plan has been proposed for the Israel-Gaza conflict by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, envisioning a truce lasting five to seven years, the release of hostages and prisoners, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

This proposal comes as Israeli air strikes continue in Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the previous ceasefire. The situation remains tense, but the mediation effort is described as serious.</p>

The ruling clarifies that transgender women can be excluded from single-sex spaces if "proportionate." This issue continues to be a source of tension within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan has agreed to step aside, paving the way for President Donald Trump to install his nominee, Jay Clayton, as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. This move marks yet another shake-up for the prominent federal prosecutor's office. Matthew Podolsky, who replaced Danielle Sassoon, has agreed to step down. Clayton, former SEC chairman, will serve in an interim capacity until Senate confirmation or appointment by federal judges. The move is likely to circumvent potential roadblocks in the confirmation process.</p>
