The group, who identify as a king, queen, and handmaiden, had claimed the land was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago and live-streamed their eviction on TikTok. The action followed a court order banning them from any council land in the area after they were previously removed from private property.</p>

          <p>A government supplier has revealed that dozens of hand-sewn American flags for Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK were replaced at a significant public cost. The US embassy reportedly objected to the standard shade of red, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead, which led to an estimated £52,800 expense. This detail highlights the extensive accommodations made for the former president during his visit, which the UK government defended by citing a £150 billion investment deal.</p>

This drop reinforces concerns about a market slowdown and comes after the company reportedly cut its annual sales target amid intense domestic price competition. In contrast, several smaller EV startups, including Leapmotor, Xpeng, and Nio, reported record-breaking monthly sales, boosted by new models and government incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

He reflected on their first encounter in January, where Hughes's confidence pushed the undefeated Nurmagomedov in a dramatic bout that ended in a unanimous decision for the champion. Hardy anticipates a different strategy from Nurmagomedov in the rematch, expecting a greater focus on wrestling after a rigorous training camp.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy has intercepted several vessels from the "Global Sumud Flotilla" attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, detaining activists on board, among them climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Israel stated the boats were approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade, while the flotilla organizers called the interception illegal and an "act of desperation." The incident has drawn international condemnation, with several countries calling for the activists' release and for Israel to allow humanitarian relief into the territory.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurants is transforming the culinary scene in Paris, offering authentic regional dishes that cater to a younger, more diverse clientele. Establishments like Tonton Mao are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare, serving specialties such as northeastern Chinese kaochuan (meat skewers) prepared by chefs brought directly from China. This trend reflects a shift in the city's Chinese immigrant population and a growing demand for genuine culinary experiences that transport diners to different regions of China.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan aimed at preventing the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company.

          <p>The British Transport Police (BTP) is facing criticism for a policy stating it will not investigate bicycle thefts outside stations if the bike was left for over two hours. This effectively means most commuter bike thefts will not be pursued, as CCTV footage will not be reviewed beyond that timeframe. Critics argue the policy decriminalizes the offense and renders secure bike parking facilities useless. The BTP defended its position, stating it must prioritize resources for investigating crimes that cause the most harm.</p>
