          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were vandalized and set on fire in downtown Los Angeles during protests against President Trump's immigration policies. The Alphabet-owned company confirmed that five vehicles were damaged and could not be recovered, leading to a temporary suspension of Waymo's service in the affected area. The protests, sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, escalated over the weekend, prompting the deployment of the California National Guard. Some individuals were observed throwing Lime e-scooters into the burning vehicles, raising concerns about the release of toxic gases from burning lithium-ion batteries. </p>
