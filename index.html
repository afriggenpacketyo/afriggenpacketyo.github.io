          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has drawn criticism after re-sharing a post from conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media that read, "It’s all about Jesus." Jackson, who frequently posts about his Christian faith, faced a wave of negative reactions for amplifying a message from a politically polarizing figure. Despite the backlash, Jackson has not commented on the matter, and his social media timeline continues to feature religious content. Kirk later responded to the controversy by reaffirming his Christian beliefs.</p>

          <p>After a two-week walkout to stall the process, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, allowing Republicans to resume their efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps. The proposed maps aim to increase the GOP's advantage in the 2026 midterm elections, a move prompted by President Trump. This mid-decade redistricting is unusual and has sparked a national political battle, with California Democrats moving to reshape their own districts in response. The outcome in these states could significantly impact the balance of power in the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>A superintendent in the California Area School District in Pennsylvania is leveraging technology to make music education more accessible for low-income students. Dr. Laura Jacob uses over 30 3D printers to create violins for just $50 each, a fraction of the typical rental cost. Inspired by a YouTube video of the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra playing plastic instruments, the initiative has produced over 200 violins in five years. The program provides the instruments for free, empowering students and fostering a love for music in a community where over 70% of students are low-income.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Guidance on Investing in Certificates of Deposit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 11:49:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remain attractive, financial experts advise savers on how much money to invest. The decision should be based on an individual's overall financial situation, including whether they have a sufficient emergency fund. Savers should also compare CD rates against other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts and consider future interest rate trends, as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates. A strategy known as a "CD ladder," which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, is also recommended to maintain liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German Foreign Ministry has confirmed that 211 Afghans who had been granted resettlement rights in Germany were deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan. These individuals, including human rights defenders and former local staff for German institutions, had fled to Pakistan after the 2021 Taliban takeover. The German government is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to facilitate their return to Pakistan. This incident occurs as over 2,000 Afghans with German admission promises remain in Pakistan, which has been deporting large numbers of Afghan refugees for over a year.</p>

          <p>Ahead of upcoming earnings reports, analysts are expressing caution regarding key cybersecurity stocks. Investment firm Evercore ISI issued a short-term negative call on CrowdStrike, citing subdued channel checks and a premium valuation that could lead to a post-earnings pullback.

However, the country remains embroiled in a widespread civil war, with large areas under the control of opposition forces. Many opponents and analysts have dismissed the election as a "sham" intended to grant legitimacy to the military regime. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party has been banned from participating, and other groups have called for a boycott, raising serious doubts about the credibility of the vote.</p>

          <p>In a significant step for advanced nuclear energy, Google and Kairos Power will deploy a new reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor will provide up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power for Google's regional data centers. In this first-of-its-kind arrangement, Kairos and Google will bear the financial risk of construction, while TVA provides a revenue stream through a power purchase agreement. The project aims to prove the viability of smaller, more affordable nuclear technology and establish a standardized design for future deployments.</p>

          <p>Conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims aired about the 2020 presidential election. The lawsuit accused Newsmax of spreading conspiracies that its voting technology was manipulated. This settlement follows a much larger $787 million payment Dominion received from Fox News for similar claims. In a statement, Newsmax did not admit wrongdoing but criticized the court's rulings as an attack on free speech, resolving one of the last major lawsuits from that election cycle.</p>

Javon Riley, 33, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm after the girl, an innocent bystander at a restaurant, was struck in the head by a bullet. The shooting was part of a feud between rival Turkish gangs, and three men outside the restaurant were the intended targets. Riley was found to have played a key role in reconnaissance and helping the still-unidentified gunman escape.</p>

          <p>The price of bitcoin fell by 2% to around $115,000 after reaching a new all-time high of over $124,000 last week. The downturn was attributed to profit-taking and broader macroeconomic concerns following higher-than-expected inflation data, which has raised doubts about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. The price drop triggered a wave of forced selling, with over $576 million in liquidations across the crypto market in 24 hours. Investors are now closely watching for signals from the Fed's upcoming economic symposium in Jackson Hole. (not investment advice)</p>

The cash allowed families to access better healthcare, leading to a 45% increase in hospital deliveries, and improved nutrition. The findings suggest that direct cash aid can be a powerful and life-saving tool in global health initiatives.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations has offered a critical analysis of President Donald Trump's approach to international mediation. The analyst, Zhang Luwei, argues that Trump's style is characterized by a heavy-handed, power-politics approach that uses America's dominant position to force conflicting parties into agreements. While this may achieve short-term ceasefires, the article suggests it fails to address deep-rooted historical grievances. This method is described as reducing complex geopolitical issues to "schoolyard fights," potentially sowing seeds for future conflict despite his Nobel Peace Prize nomination.</p>

          <p>The U.S. documentary film community is facing a severe funding crisis after the federal government rescinded the entire budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The move has forced deep cuts at PBS and major documentary co-producers like ITVS, which received 86% of its funding from the CPB. This loss of a critical financial pipeline has left filmmakers scrambling to find alternative support through international partnerships, streaming platforms, and private donations. Many in the industry worry that the stories being told will become less diverse and more commercial as a result.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that despite recent diplomatic overtures, Russia's fundamental goal of subjugating Ukraine remains unchanged, making a negotiated peace unlikely under current conditions. The article posits that Moscow's territorial demands and apparent concessions on security guarantees are likely a ruse to weaken Western resolve. The only plausible path to a lasting end to the war, it suggests, is for the United States and its allies to commit to a massive and sustained military buildup of Ukrainian forces. This would create a battlefield reality where Russia is convinced it cannot make further gains.</p>
