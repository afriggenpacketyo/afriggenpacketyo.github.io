          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has ordered the dismissal of charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr., a Utah plastic surgeon accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines and distributing fraudulent vaccination cards. He was indicted in 2023 for allegedly defrauding the government by providing fake certificates for a fee and giving children saline shots at parents' request. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the charges were dropped because Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice," a move praised by some Republican lawmakers but occurring amid ongoing debates about vaccine mandates and safety.</p>

          <p>Advocates in the UK are calling for a change in cosmetic labeling regulations, urging that ingredients be listed in English rather than the currently used Latin-based scientific names. Campaigners, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, argue that the Latin nomenclature puts consumers with allergies at significant risk, as many cannot recognize potential allergens. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global harmonization, parents and consumers share stories of dangerous allergic reactions, highlighting the need for clearer, more accessible information similar to food packaging standards.</p>

          <p>Following a high-level meeting between their foreign ministers, North Korea has publicly pledged its continued and unconditional support for Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. North Korean state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, reinforcing the strategic partnership between the two nations. This declaration solidifies the alignment that has seen North Korea provide significant military aid to Russia, including troops and munitions, for its conflict against Ukraine. The meeting also resulted in a signed exchange plan for 2026-2027, further deepening their bilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are experiencing significant economic pressure due to a sharp decline in the country's birth rate, leading to a dramatic drop in student enrollment. The number of kindergartens fell by over 13% since 2020, and enrollment has decreased by more than 25% in the same period. In response, some institutions, including a government-affiliated kindergarten in Harbin that once exclusively served officials' children, are now forced to recruit from the general public to stay afloat. This trend reflects the broader demographic and economic challenges China faces from its shrinking population.</p>

          <p>In the murder case of Matthew Trussler, audio from a neighbor's security camera played a crucial role in the conviction of his girlfriend, Melissa Turner. While Turner claimed she stabbed Trussler in self-defense during a physical altercation, the surveillance footage captured a woman's voice yelling phrases like "So f****** die." Prosecutors argued this, along with video from an in-home camera showing Turner following an unarmed Trussler, contradicted her self-defense narrative. Despite her testimony, a jury found Turner guilty of second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to over 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained during federal immigration raids on two California cannabis farms, where authorities arrested over 300 people suspected of being in the country illegally. The deceased worker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, reportedly fell from a greenhouse roof while fleeing agents. The Department of Homeland Security stated he was not being pursued at the time of his fall. The raids have sparked protests and a tense standoff between demonstrators and federal agents, leading a federal judge to temporarily halt similar operations in Southern California amid legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly expressed support for Attorney General Pam Bondi following internal tensions and public backlash over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The controversy erupted after the DOJ announced it would not release further records and stated that a rumored "client list" never existed, a move that angered many of the president's supporters. This decision led to a reported confrontation between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In his statement, Trump urged unity within his movement and dismissed the Epstein case as unimportant.</p>
