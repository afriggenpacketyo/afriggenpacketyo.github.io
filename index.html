          <p>China has officially acknowledged the jailing of a Japanese national in Shanghai for spying, marking the first official statement on the case. This confirmation follows reports from Japanâ€™s Kyodo news agency that the individual, a man in his 50s, received a 12-year sentence on espionage charges. Beijing emphasized that the judicial authorities handled the case strictly following legal procedures, safeguarding the individual's rights and interests throughout the process. The Chinese foreign ministry urged Japan to respect China's judicial sovereignty and ensure its citizens comply with Chinese laws while in China. Relevant context: This incident is part of a series of cases involving Japanese nationals charged with espionage by Chinese authorities in recent years.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading but ultimately rose after the company announced a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The announcement came alongside an earnings report that showed operating income for the last three months of the financial year beating analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. The financial unit will be listed this year and classified as a discontinued operation in Sony's accounting, though Sony's outlook for the current financial year was described as lackluster.

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Riyadh, a meeting facilitated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohanmmed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This encounter, the first of its kind in 25 years, signifies a major shift for Syria following years of international isolation under former dictator Bashar Assad. Trump expressed hope for the new Syrian government's success and its ability to stabilize the country. Al-Sharaa assumed leadership after leading rebels in an uprising that ousted Assad's government, and the lifting of sanctions was met with opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who fears potential threats from Syria under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established a new government department focused on streamlining the state apparatus, appointing Karsten Wildberger as its head. Wildberger's role, as the Minister for Digitalization and State Modernization, involves overseeing the state's IT infrastructure, drawing comparisons to Elon Musk's efforts in the US government. While Wildberger aims to enhance efficiency and digitalization, he emphasizes a collaborative approach and respects EU data privacy regulations. Unlike Musk, Wildberger is officially part of the government and subject to its compromises, with his powers also limited by Germany's federal system, requiring alliances with state governments.</p>

Domestic games revenue saw a significant increase, driven by popular titles such as "Honor of Kings" and "Peacekeeper Elite," as well as newer games. Tencent also runs WeChat, a super app with over 1.4 billion monthly active users, which has allowed the company to monetize the platform through advertising, becoming a fast-growing business.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy has defended these cuts as necessary to eliminate wasteful spending, but critics argue that essential services are being compromised.

          <p>China has issued a warning to the UK regarding its new trade deal with the US, suggesting that the agreement could compel British companies to exclude Chinese products from their supply chains. Beijing argues that the deal violates the principle that international agreements should not target third countries. The UK-US trade deal offers Britain relief from US tariffs on car and steel exports, contingent on compliance with strict American security requirements. China views these clauses as "poison pills" and a departure from efforts to rebuild bilateral ties, fearing they are designed to pressure allies into economically isolating China.</p>

          <p>A UK political opinion poll tracker reveals a significant shift in voting intentions, with Labour losing ground since their landslide victory last summer.

The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, and pollsters are using MRPs (Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification) to predict constituency-level race outcomes, acknowledging a margin of error in all polls.</p>

The proposed policy would require recipients to work, participate in job training, or volunteer at least 20 hours a week, with limited exceptions.

          <p>Inter Miami is facing early-season challenges, including a significant defeat to Minnesota United, highlighting structural issues within the team. Like Messi's previous team, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Miami struggles to balance its star-studded forward line with the rest of the team. The team has a habit of conceding goals and has failed to secure major titles with Messi, SuÃ¡rez, Alba, and Busquets. Tactical adjustments have been made, but defensive vulnerabilities remain, and the team is expected to make moves in the summer transfer window to address these issues.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock has released a report highlighting the potential negative consequences of implementing work requirements for Medicaid eligibility. Drawing from experiences in Arkansas and Georgia, Warnock argues that these requirements, often labeled as "work reporting requirements," create bureaucratic hurdles that prevent eligible Americans from accessing coverage. He asserts that there is no evidence that these requirements incentivize work and that they primarily serve to remove hardworking individuals from their health care plans. A Republican House budget resolution includes substantial cuts to Medicaid and includes work requirements, which the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates could put millions at risk of losing coverage.</p>

          <p>New academic standards in Oklahoma mandate the teaching of "discrepancies" in the 2020 election results, perpetuating a false narrative promoted by President Trump and his allies. The standards require students to identify alleged discrepancies by examining graphs and other information, including claims about ballot counting and mail-in voting. Critics argue that the standards instruct students to accept these claims as valid, rather than encouraging critical thinking. The standards were introduced and approved rapidly, with limited review by educators, leading to controversy and a lawsuit challenging their implementation.</p>

          <p>Burberry has announced plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs as part of its ongoing turnaround efforts, which aim to reduce costs and revive the brand. The measures, expected to be completed by 2027, include cost-cutting across procurement and real estate, with the majority of job cuts impacting office-based roles, stores, and its factory in Castleford, England. These changes follow previous cost-cutting measures and mark the latest phase of CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy to improve Burberry's performance. While sales fell less than anticipated in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company cited macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical developments as downside risks.</p>
