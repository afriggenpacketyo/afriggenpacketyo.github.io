          <p>President Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on imported cars has prompted automakers to react with measures ranging from temporary production halts and layoffs to shipment pauses and strategic price adjustments. Stellantis, for example, announced temporary halts in production at some of its assembly plants in Mexico and Canada, resulting in temporary layoffs. Some automakers like Hyundai and Toyota are holding off on price increases for the time being, while others like Ferrari have already announced price hikes.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. While the IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, it admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The army originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights, a claim that has been proven inaccurate.&#x20;</p>
