          <p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the Supreme Court's increased use of its emergency docket, defending the practice as a necessary response to presidents increasingly using executive orders. He noted that as executive power expands, legal challenges requiring swift judicial intervention naturally follow. Kavanaugh also commented on the court's internal processes, stating that they have evolved to better handle these urgent cases, and emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices despite differing opinions. He acknowledged public criticism as an inherent part of the job for judges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revised its "reciprocal" tariff schedule, issuing an executive order that sets new duties ranging from 10% to 41% on dozens of countries, effective August 7th. A significant addition is a 40% tariff on all goods determined to be transshipped to circumvent duties. While some Asian nations received lower rates than previously announced, countries like Syria, Laos, and Myanmar face the highest tariffs. Trade experts expressed concern over the continued uncertainty and the potential for further increases, highlighting the administration's unpredictable approach to global trade policy.

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under the Biden administration, had her faculty appointment at West Point rescinded. The decision by the Army Secretary followed a social media campaign by a pro-Trump activist who accused Easterly of undermining the current administration. Easterly, a West Point alumna and decorated Army veteran, described the rescission as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The move has drawn attention to the influence of political activism on military and academic appointments.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the newly announced U.S. tariff schedule, which for many included lower rates than initially feared. Leaders from Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments, viewing the reduced duties as beneficial for their economies and reflective of strong bilateral ties. Taiwan's president noted the new 20% rate is temporary pending further negotiations, while Malaysia's prime minister indicated the revised tariffs would not burden the country's economy. Japan welcomed the reduced uncertainty but continues to push for confirmation on lower auto tariffs, highlighting a general sense of cautious optimism across the region.</p>

          <p>The National Assembly in El Salvador, controlled by President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, has approved constitutional amendments that permit indefinite presidential reelection and extend the presidential term to six years. The changes were passed with a supermajority vote despite opposition lawmakers decrying the move as the death of the nation's democracy. Proponents argued the change aligns the presidency with other elected offices that already allow unlimited reelection. The move solidifies the power of the highly popular but controversial president, who is known for his aggressive crackdown on gangs.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told "The Late Show" host Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is currently "broken." Harris explained her recent decision not to run for California governor by stating her desire to step away from "the system" for now, though she affirmed her commitment to remaining part of the fight for democratic principles. She expressed that the nation's systems are not as strong as they need to be to defend fundamental values. The interview took place on Colbert's show shortly after CBS announced its cancellation.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal *Cell* reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species. Scientists solved the long-standing puzzle by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a gene from the ancient tomato gave the plant the ability to form tubers, while a gene from the other wild parent helped control their growth. The findings demonstrate how hybridization between different species can give rise to entirely new traits and spur the emergence of new species.</p>

The operation involves ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers often turning off their transponders and covering their names to avoid identification. This illicit trade is estimated to have generated tens of billions of dollars for Iran, undermining international sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear program.

Currently, UK drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, with no upper age limit or mandatory testing. Statistics show older drivers are disproportionately represented in fatal and serious injury collisions.

          <p>Apple announced a 10% year-over-year revenue increase in its third fiscal quarter, surpassing analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings. The strong performance was driven by record sales for the iPhone and growth in the services division. Despite the positive financial results, the company provided little new information on its long-term artificial intelligence strategy, which has become a key focus for investors. While CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the company's significant investment in AI, the lack of a clear roadmap has tempered investor enthusiasm for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument at the state capitol to honor an individual African American, joining statues of white men, many with ties to the Confederacy. The project, made possible by a bipartisan push from state lawmakers, is seen by historians as a step toward completing the state's historical narrative. The statue is being created by artist Basil Watson.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has begun deporting convicted criminal migrants to third-party countries in Africa, such as Eswatini and South Sudan, when their home countries will not accept them. This practice has alarmed UN experts and human rights groups, who argue it may violate the international legal principle of non-refoulement, which forbids sending individuals to unsafe countries. While the deals' details are secret, some African nations may agree due to fear of U.S. retaliation or in exchange for incentives, though others, like Nigeria, have refused to participate in the program.</p>

          <p>In the first federal trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million in damages from Tesla over a fatal 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. The lawsuit was filed by the surviving victim and the family of Naibel Benavides, who was killed when a Model S using Enhanced Autopilot crashed into her and her parked car in Florida. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla's system had dangerous defects and that the company overstated its capabilities, encouraging driver over-reliance. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault for the collision.</p>

          <p>Two senior U.S. officials are making a highly unusual visit to Gaza to inspect a food distribution site as concerns mount over a severe humanitarian crisis. The visit comes as aid workers and the UN warn of a "politically manmade famine" unfolding in the territory, with children reportedly fainting from hunger. President Trump has expressed frustration that aid is not reaching Palestinians, blaming Hamas for intercepting supplies, though a U.S. analysis found no evidence of systemic theft. The visit highlights increasing international pressure on all parties to alleviate the catastrophic conditions.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, driven by strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising divisions. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to investor disappointment with the growth rate of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit, which was only slightly ahead of forecasts. The company's third-quarter operating income guidance also came in below expectations. Management attributed ongoing AI-related supply constraints, particularly access to power, as a challenge for AWS, while also planning for increased capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of teenagers are using caffeine pouches, small teabag-like products placed in the mouth that deliver a rapid and potent dose of the stimulant. Health experts are expressing concern over the trend, which is promoted by some social media influencers, as the pouches can contain as much caffeine as two cups of coffee. This makes it easy to consume excessive amounts, potentially leading to adverse effects like rapid heart rate, anxiety, and, in rare cases, overdose. The discreet nature of the pouches also makes them easy for teens to hide from parents and teachers.</p>
