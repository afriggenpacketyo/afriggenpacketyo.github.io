          <p>A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the Alaskan peninsula, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a tsunami warning for South Alaska and surrounding coastal areas. The quake occurred approximately 54 miles south of Sand Point, a town located about 600 miles southwest of Anchorage. Authorities have urged residents in the designated warning zones to immediately evacuate to higher ground or the upper floors of multi-story buildings as a precautionary measure. The situation is currently unfolding, with officials monitoring potential tsunami activity and providing updates to the public as they become available.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from corn syrup to cane sugar for its beverages sold in the United States. This change follows public health concerns voiced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding the health effects of corn syrup. In a social media post, Trump praised the decision as a positive move for the company and consumers, suggesting it would result in a better product. The shift marks a significant change in the company's U.S. production formula, aligning it with versions of the product sold in other countries that already use cane sugar.</p>

          <p>A landmark study has demonstrated the success of a genetic technique, often called mitochondrial donation, in preventing the transmission of devastating inherited disorders. British researchers utilized the method to help families have eight healthy children, who are now developing normally. The procedure involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, creating an embryo with genetic material from three individuals. While hailed as a breakthrough by many scientists and families, the technique has also reignited ethical debates over potential long-term risks and fears of creating so-called "designer babies."</p>

          <p>Doctors in the United Kingdom have confirmed the birth of eight babies using a pioneering fertility technique that incorporates DNA from three people to prevent incurable mitochondrial diseases. The method, developed in Newcastle, combines the parents' genetic material with healthy mitochondria from a female donor, ensuring the children are born free from these often-fatal conditions. The children, including a set of twins, are reportedly meeting all developmental milestones, marking a major success for the treatment which has been legal in the UK for a decade. The families involved have expressed immense gratitude for the procedure that has lifted the burden of inherited disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's strategy of dismissing the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as a Democratic "hoax" may be backfiring by pitting him against his own loyal supporters. By attacking Republicans and his base for believing in what he calls a "scam," Trump is deviating from his typical us-versus-them rhetoric that has historically unified his followers. This approach risks undermining his image as an anti-establishment truth-teller, making him appear defensive and potentially having something to hide. While most Republican officials remain publicly aligned with him, the continued grumbling from his base could create significant political challenges for the president.</p>

His legal team argues that new evidence from pathologists indicates the child's death was a tragic accident, not a homicide, and that no rational juror would convict him today. Despite these claims and a pending appeal for a new trial, the state is moving forward with the execution, prompting outrage from his supporters.</p>

The successful party demonstrates how a beloved pet can foster a strong sense of community and provide a vital boost for an independent business.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is receiving accolades for his deft navigation of U.S.-China geopolitical tensions, culminating in Washington's approval to resume sales of specialized AI chips to China. Huang consistently argued that restricting access to the Chinese market would ultimately harm U.S. tech leadership, a message that appears to have resonated with the Trump administration. His ability to lobby Washington while maintaining positive relations in Beijing has been described as a diplomatic masterclass by market analysts. The reversal is seen as a major victory for Nvidia, reinforcing Huang's reputation as a uniquely effective business statesman. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) agenda is gaining significant traction at the state level, often outpacing federal action. States like Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas have enacted laws to remove fluoride from water, restrict soda purchases with food stamps, and mandate warning labels on products with artificial additives. This state-led approach allows Kennedy to advance his goals without creating new federal regulations, which aligns with the Trump administration's anti-red tape stance. While this strategy empowers states, it also means his vision for a national dietary overhaul depends on a patchwork of local legislation.</p>

The court's jurisdiction applies when states have agreed to it, either through a blanket declaration, mutual consent for a specific case, or by being signatories to treaties like the Genocide Convention that designate the ICJ as the arbiter. However, the ICJ has no enforcement mechanism, meaning its binding rulings ultimately depend on the cooperation of the involved parties.</p>

Originally owned by oil baron Waite Phillips and later by actors Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, the ranch has a rich Hollywood history.

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the celebrated poet laureate of Colorado who died at age 49, transformed their perspective on life after receiving a terminal ovarian cancer diagnosis. Instead of adopting a combative stance, Gibson chose to accept their illness, a decision they said led to some of the most joyous moments of their life by highlighting life's brevity. This philosophy mirrored the themes in their poetry, which often explored kindness, empathy, and love with a tender, unselfconscious honesty. Gibson's work, known for its accessible yet powerful language, resonated deeply with fans by finding strength in vulnerability and advocating for generosity even amidst cruelty.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced new restrictions on tariff-free steel imports to protect its domestic industry from the impact of punitive U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that tariff rate quotas will be tightened, and a 50% tariff will be applied to imports exceeding 50% of 2024 volumes from non-free-trade partners. The measures specifically target steel melted and poured in China and mandate the use of Canadian steel in federal government projects. This defensive economic policy follows the Trump administration's imposition of a 50% tariff on Canadian steel, which has caused a significant downturn in Canada's steel production.</p>

          <p>According to a recent Economist/YouGov survey, President Donald Trump's disapproval rating has reached a new high for his second term, with 55% of U.S. adults disapproving of his job performance. This marks an increase from the 43% disapproval he held at the start of his second term in January. The decline in his favorability appears to be driven primarily by a drop in support among Democrats and independents. The poll also found that 59% of his own 2024 voters believe the government is covering up evidence in the Jeffrey Epstein case, suggesting the controversy may be impacting his standing.</p>

Critics argue the IHRA definition is overly broad and can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by conflating it with antisemitism.

          <p>A recent uptick in U.S. inflation, which rose 2.7% annually in June, is likely to keep borrowing costs high for consumers. Because credit card interest rates are closely tied to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, persistent inflation makes it more probable that the Fed will maintain its high-rate policy to cool the economy. This, in turn, means variable credit card APRs, which have already surpassed 21% on average, are likely to remain elevated or climb even higher. For consumers carrying debt, this environment makes it more difficult to pay down balances, increasing the urgency of exploring debt management strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
