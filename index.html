          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, despite legal challenges and concerns over his implanted heart defibrillator. The execution proceeded without deactivating the device, marking what experts believe is a first-of-its-kind case in the U.S. Black's attorneys argued the active defibrillator could cause unnecessary pain, but courts ultimately allowed the execution to move forward. The case also highlighted ethical concerns for medical professionals' involvement in executions and ongoing debates about the death penalty, particularly for inmates with severe health conditions and claims of intellectual disability.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and DNC Chair Ken Martin have publicly supported Texas Democrats who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. The Texas Democrats broke quorum to prevent a vote on new congressional maps that would heavily favor the GOP. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has authorized civil arrest warrants for the absent lawmakers. The standoff highlights a national partisan battle over voting rights and gerrymandering, with Democrats accusing Republicans of attempting to disenfranchise minority voters to secure their majority.</p>

          <p>A devastating flash flood and landslide have struck a village in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, resulting in at least four confirmed deaths and leaving around 50 people missing. The disaster, triggered by a cloudburst, swept away numerous homes and vehicles in the popular tourist area of Dharali. Rescue operations involving local police, national disaster response teams, and the army are currently underway. This event underscores the region's vulnerability to extreme weather, which scientists increasingly link to the effects of climate change on the ecologically sensitive Himalayas.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced plans to restore and reinstall a controversial statue of Confederate General Albert Pike in Washington D.C. The statue was torn down by protesters during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June 2020. Officials cited federal historic preservation laws and executive orders as the basis for the decision. The move has been met with immediate opposition, including from D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who pledged to reintroduce legislation for the statue's permanent removal, reigniting a long-standing debate over honoring Confederate figures.</p>

          <p>The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has denied all allegations in a lawsuit filed by six former San Diego Wave employees, claiming it has "no duty of care" in the matter. The suit includes serious allegations of sexual assault by a co-worker, sexual harassment, and racial discrimination. In its legal response, the NWSL argued that any alleged incidents were between the individuals and the club, not the league, and also invoked the "doctrine of consent." This defense has been described by legal experts as a standard "boilerplate" response intended to preserve all possible legal defenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Dutch foundation has initiated a large-scale class-action lawsuit against FIFA and several European football associations, arguing that current transfer regulations have unlawfully suppressed player incomes. The case, which could represent 100,000 footballers, follows a European Court of Justice ruling that found some FIFA rules on player transfers violated EU law. Legal experts describe the lawsuit as a "seismic confrontation" that could be as transformative as the 1995 Bosman ruling. The outcome could potentially rewrite the rules of player mobility and contractual freedom across the global football industry.</p>

          <p>The acting head of NASA has directed the agency to develop and launch a small nuclear power plant to the moon's surface by late 2029. The directive aims to establish a U.S. power source on the moon before potential rivals like China and Russia, who are planning a joint lunar reactor for the mid-2030s. The plan calls for a microreactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts of electricity to support the Artemis lunar exploration program. This ambitious goal comes amid proposed budget cuts for NASA and as the agency continues to operate without a Senate-confirmed leader.</p>

The move is seen as a major coup for LAFC and the league, expected to significantly boost the team's offense and engage Southern California's large Korean American community.

          <p>An agreement has been reached in President Trump's libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, with media mogul Rupert Murdoch agreeing to provide a sworn declaration about his health. Trump's legal team had initially demanded an immediate deposition, citing the 94-year-old's advanced age and health issues. The lawsuit stems from a WSJ article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, which the president claims is fake. Under the new agreement, Murdoch will provide regular health updates, and the request for his deposition is paused pending a ruling on the newspaper's motion to dismiss the case.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a widening gap in workforce participation between American women based on their level of education. Over the past two decades, the share of college-educated women in the labor force has increased by nine percentage points, while participation for women without a degree has remained nearly flat. Researchers attribute this divergence to factors like the rise of flexible and remote work arrangements, which primarily benefit white-collar jobs. The study suggests that while progress has been made for women in the workplace, the benefits have disproportionately gone to those with higher education.</p>

The regulator found that Woodford and his firm made "unreasonable and inappropriate" investment decisions, increasing the fund's holdings in illiquid assets, which prevented them from meeting withdrawal requests. Woodford's firm has stated it "strongly" disagrees with the findings and plans to appeal, meaning the decision is not yet final.</p>

In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, reporting a 4% increase in same-store sales, driven by new chicken menu items.

The agency implemented the phone-sharing system to reduce wait times, but critics argue it is an ineffective solution that wastes time for both the public and employees.

          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," explores its central argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not an inevitable outcome but rather a product of miscalculation, hubris, and chance. The book focuses on the shah's inability to stop the movement, the U.S. government's oblivious and unfocused response, and the surprising rise of Ayatollah Khomeini. Anderson's account, based heavily on interviews with key American officials, portrays the revolution as a contingent event. It suggests that a series of specific actions and inactions, rather than grand historical forces, led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic.</p>

          <p>The new congressional maps proposed by Texas Republicans are drawing sharp criticism for diluting the voting power of the state's large and growing Latino population. Civic groups and Democratic lawmakers argue the plan is a form of racial gerrymandering that violates the Voting Rights Act. For example, the map redraws the district of Austin's first Latino representative, Greg Casar, and splits up historic minority communities. Despite Latinos being the largest demographic group in Texas, critics say the new map not only fails to create new majority-Latino districts but actively weakens existing ones to secure a partisan advantage.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether buying an annuity is a sound financial decision for a 70-year-old, weighing the potential benefits against the drawbacks. For healthy individuals seeking a guaranteed, lifelong income stream, purchasing an annuity later in life can result in higher monthly payments. However, annuities often lack liquidity, meaning the principal investment cannot be easily accessed for emergencies or left to heirs. The decision depends heavily on an individual's health, risk tolerance, other income sources, and overall financial goals, making it a complex choice for retirement planning.
