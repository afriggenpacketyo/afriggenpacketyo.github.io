          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have voiced their support and renewed calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah, stated the attacks were a result of the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people and urged Khamenei to step down. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, echoed this sentiment, asserting Khamenei's responsibility for a costly and destructive nuclear project and calling for regime change towards a democratic, non-nuclear republic with gender equality. The dissident groups see the U.S. strikes as an opportunity to weaken the current regime and push for a transition to a free Iran.</p>

          <p>An NPR interview with Evan Osnos, author of "The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich," delves into the lifestyle and mindset of the extremely wealthy in America. Osnos discusses how the election of Donald Trump highlighted Americans' complex feelings about money and elites. He shares anecdotes from his reporting, such as pop stars performing at private children's events and the phenomenon of gigayachts, luxury boats the length of a football field. The author also touches on the "gilded despair" of Silicon Valley doomsday preppers, who fear the technologies they created might lead to societal collapse.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, in what he described as a "spectacular military success." The objective was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the nuclear threat. The U.S. reportedly used B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles in the attacks, and officials stated that Iran was informed that the strikes were not intended to lead to regime change. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers, with some Republicans supporting the move and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization.</p>

The IDF also stated that alert sirens did not sound in Haifa despite a missile impact, indicating a potential issue with the interceptor system.

          <p>An analysis examines the precarious position of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The destruction of Fordo has weakened Khamenei, whose security forces are reportedly infiltrated and reeling from Israeli airstrikes. Experts suggest that Khamenei's intransigence has led to this vulnerability, prompting speculation about the future of the regime. Potential scenarios include a revolution, an internal coup, or a smooth succession, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) playing a significant role in any transition.</p>

          <p>An analysis examines the potential consequences of regime change in Iran, warning against the historical pitfalls of foreign-imposed interventions. The article cites examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, where regime change led to instability, violence, and long-term challenges. Experts express skepticism about the feasibility of externally driven regime change in Iran, emphasizing the need for internal support and a stable transition. The analysis concludes that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to achieve regime change and that a ground invasion would be necessary, a prospect with its own set of risks.</p>

          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Kazakhstan highlighted Beijing's efforts to strengthen economic and political ties with the region. Agreements worth nearly US$25 billion were signed between China and its Central Asian partners, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Kazakhstan announced that China National Nuclear Corporation would lead a project to build another nuclear power plant. These developments indicate China's growing influence in the region, although the European Union and Russia are also vying for influence.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the article analyzes potential Iranian responses and the implications for the region. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised President Trump's decision, while Iran has vowed to retaliate. The key question is whether Iran will have the capability or willingness to strike U.S. bases and diplomatic missions in the region. The best-case scenario is that moderate elements within the Iranian regime will recognize their strategic defeat and engage in dialogue, but the possibility of escalation remains high.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and the presence of foreign male DNA. Despite maintaining her innocence, Dorotik was initially found guilty based on circumstantial evidence and testimony from her sons. The Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover these inconsistencies, leading to the dismissal of charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have published studies suggesting that advances in cell transplantation into the spleen could transform the organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Research indicates that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, a more promising long-term survival site than the liver, could be engineered into a transplant hub using nanoparticles. These findings could lead to new treatments for diabetes, which affects millions worldwide, including a significant population in China.</p>
