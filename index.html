          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 03:36:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision, effectively blocking President Donald Trump's executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the order's interpretation, which would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents without legal or permanent status, as unconstitutional. This ruling maintains a nationwide injunction against the controversial policy, with the court noting the case fell under a specific exception to recent Supreme Court limitations on such injunctions. The decision marks a significant legal challenge for the Trump administration, which faces numerous lawsuits across the country regarding this executive action.</p>

          <p>Russian rescue services have located the wreckage of an Angara airlines An-24 plane that vanished with 43 passengers and six crew members in the far-eastern Amur region. The aircraft, which included five children, disappeared from radar while approaching Tynda airport, and tragically, no survivors are thought to have been found. The plane was discovered burning on a hillside, with preliminary investigations focusing on potential causes such as pilot error in adverse weather conditions or a technical malfunction. This incident underscores concerns about the safety of older aircraft, as this particular model has been involved in fatal crashes previously.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has responded to reports indicating President Donald Trump's name appears in Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, with a spokesman dismissing them as "fake news." The Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump of his inclusion, clarifying that it does not imply wrongdoing. Despite Trump's past promises to release Epstein files, his administration has faced criticism for not delivering a rumored "client list," which the DOJ and FBI later stated does not exist. A Florida judge also denied unsealing related court files, citing grand jury secrecy, while attention shifts to Ghislaine Maxwell's upcoming meeting with a senior Justice Department official.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated his "American AI Action Plan" by signing three executive orders, emphasizing a commitment to keeping "woke AI" out of government operations and boosting the U.S. as an AI export leader. A key order, "PREVENTING WOKE AI IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT," mandates that federal agencies avoid AI models that compromise truthfulness and accuracy for ideological agendas like DEI. The administration contends that DEI in AI can lead to biased results and manipulate information. These directives emerge amidst recent controversies surrounding AI models, such as Google's Gemini and xAI's Grok, highlighting the broader challenges of ensuring neutrality and objectivity in artificial intelligence development.</p>

          <p>British car and van production in the first half of the year has fallen to its lowest point since 1953, excluding the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. This sharp decline, which includes a 7.3% decrease in car output and a 45% drop in van production, is partly linked to earlier uncertainty surrounding US tariffs, despite a recent deal to reduce them. Although the government has reintroduced electric vehicle (EV) grants, the industry expresses concerns over the lack of clear eligibility guidelines. Industry leaders anticipate that the sector will not return to 2021 production levels by the end of the decade, signaling ongoing challenges for the UK's automotive manufacturing.</p>

Von der Leyen stressed that rebalancing the relationship is essential, requiring both sides to acknowledge concerns and propose concrete solutions. This comes as trade tensions have risen, with the EU's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles prompting Beijing to initiate anti-dumping probes into European goods, indicating persistent underlying differences in objectives.</p>

The bank is adapting to a lower interest rate environment set by the European Central Bank and acknowledges that potential U.S. tariffs could create headwinds for European exporters, but overall, the firm is on track.

          <p>China's waste-to-energy incineration industry is grappling with a notable oversupply, leaving approximately 40% of its processing capacity unused. While municipal solid waste generation has increased by over 10% since 2019, the country's incineration capacity has more than doubled in the same period, creating a significant imbalance. Experts suggest that a deceleration in waste supply growth, influenced by factors such as an economic downturn and slower urbanization, is contributing to this issue. This situation reflects a broader economic challenge in China, where ambitious industrial expansion has outpaced the actual demand for waste processing.</p>

          <p>England and Spain are preparing for a highly anticipated clash in the Euro 2025 Women's final in Basel, marking a significant rematch of the 2023 Women's World Cup final, which Spain previously won. Spanish midfielder Mariona Caldentey, a key player for Arsenal and the reigning WSL player of the year, acknowledges England's formidable capabilities despite their challenging path to the final. Both teams possess a deep familiarity with each other's strategies, having recently competed twice in the Women's Nations League. As world champions, Spain aims for their inaugural Euros final triumph, while England, having overcome several setbacks, seeks to secure their third consecutive major final appearance.</p>

          <p>Kanye West's former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, is reportedly in hiding and experiencing fear after filing updated sexual assault claims against the rapper, as stated by her lawyer to the BBC. Pisciotta's lawsuit, which initially alleged sexual harassment and stalking, has been amended to include accusations of sex trafficking and sexual assault. West has strongly denied these claims, labeling them as "fantasy fiction." Pisciotta also asserts that she was subjected to "swatting" incidents and received threats warning her against pursuing the lawsuit. The legal action further alleges that West exposed his employees to extreme displays of racism and antisemitism. The civil case is scheduled to proceed in court next month, with West's team maintaining their strong denial of all accusations.</p>

          <p>Six university students tragically drowned in an industrial tank during a field trip to a mining operation in Inner Mongolia, owned by China's prestigious China National Gold Group. The incident, which also injured one teacher, occurred when a grating panel collapsed, causing the students, who were studying mineral processing engineering, to fall into a flotation tank within the mine's processing plant. Despite immediate efforts to retrieve them, the students could not be revived. This unfortunate event underscores critical safety concerns associated with industrial visits and raises questions about the protocols and oversight in place to protect participants during such educational excursions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's upcoming five-day private visit to his Scottish golf resorts is anticipated to be met with significant protests across Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire. Organizers from the Stop Trump Coalition expect a "wave of resistance," citing "widespread anger" over what they describe as the US president's increasingly extreme policies, including mass deportations. While Police Scotland expects lawful demonstrations, the policing operation is projected to strain resources. During his visit, Trump is also scheduled to hold talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Despite the informal nature of the meeting, it is anticipated to draw media attention, given Trump's history of making public statements.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, the rate-rigging convictions of former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have been overturned, raising significant questions about potential compensation and future appeals for others. The Supreme Court's ruling, which deemed their Libor manipulation convictions unsafe, could pave the way for seven other jailed traders to appeal their cases. Hayes expressed skepticism about receiving compensation from the British government but noted the possibility of suing former employers, as seen in a similar US case. The decision also fuels calls for a public inquiry into the broader scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigative practices.

          <p>A growing debate surrounds the extent of universities' responsibility for student mental health, as students report feeling let down by "one-size-fits-all" services. The number of students with mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled in a decade, coinciding with late adolescence being a peak age for such issues and the pressures of university life. While universities like Nottingham claim increased investment, they emphasize that their services are not a substitute for clinical NHS care. Concerns persist about academic tutors being first points of contact without adequate training, the complexity of accessing services, and long NHS waiting times, prompting calls for closer collaboration between universities and health authorities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to make an unprecedented official visit to the Federal Reserve, marking the first such trip by an American president in nearly two decades. This move is widely perceived as a significant escalation of his ongoing public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has consistently criticized for the central bank's interest rate policies and has even publicly considered dismissing. The visit directly challenges the long-held tradition of maintaining the Federal Reserve's independence from political influence. Trump's physical presence at the Fed's headquarters underscores his direct and assertive approach to monetary policy, despite legal questions surrounding his authority to remove the chairman.</p>

This research challenges the popular 10,000-step guideline, revealing its origin as a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign rather than evidence-based science. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults worldwide, concluding that even moderate increases in daily activity, starting from around 4,000 steps, provide tangible health benefits. While existing exercise guidelines often focus on time, the study suggests that step counts could serve as a practical and accessible supplementary recommendation for promoting physical activity throughout the day.</p>
