          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has advanced President Trump's major legislative bill after a prolonged overnight session. Speaker Mike Johnson successfully secured the necessary votes for the procedural rule, overcoming resistance from a small group of Republican holdouts. The debate, which featured a lengthy speech from Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemning the bill's Medicaid cuts, concluded in the early morning hours. This procedural victory paves the way for a final vote on the sweeping tax and policy package, a cornerstone of Trump's second-term agenda.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," for the first time, discovering it equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna. While the drone vessel was not carrying drugs, authorities believe it was a test run by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug trafficking cartel. This seizure highlights a significant technological evolution in drug smuggling, as unmanned subs are harder to detect and eliminate the risk of crew capture. The use of advanced technology like Starlink demonstrates the increasing sophistication of transnational criminal organizations in their logistical operations.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court issued a significant ruling, determining that a state law from 1849 does not function as a ban on abortion. This decision effectively preserves legal access to abortion services throughout the state. The ruling addresses the long-standing legal ambiguity surrounding the pre-Civil War statute, which had been a point of contention in the post-Roe v. Wade legal landscape. The court's interpretation ensures that, for the time being, abortion remains legal in Wisconsin, marking a pivotal moment for reproductive rights in the region.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively working to refresh its attacking lineup this summer, with a primary focus on acquiring a new center-forward and up to two creative midfielders. The club has pursued RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, though a deal has proven difficult, leading them to explore other options like Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. Additionally, Arsenal is considering wingers such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze to add more flair. The club's transfer activities, led by sporting director Andrea Berta, will likely require a significant financial outlay and may involve selling an established player.</p>

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found that historical child sexual exploitation investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council. Some documents were so obscured they were unusable, which particularly affected major inquiries like Operation Green Jacket and Operation Bernese. While the report notes that Greater Manchester Police has since made significant improvements in its handling of such cases, the past failures eroded trust among victims.

His speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds is expected to reassure farmers about his trade policies, which have created economic uncertainty due to retaliatory tariffs from countries like China. The visit comes as Trump pressures Congress to pass his extensive tax and spending bill, which has faced some criticism within the Republican party.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's presidency, despite its disruptive rhetoric, ultimately represents a continuation of America's long-standing political orthodoxies. The author contends that Trump's major domestic policy bill embodies neoliberalism with its tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts to social programs. Simultaneously, his recent military strike on Iran is framed as a revival of neoconservative foreign policy. The article concludes that rather than breaking from the political establishment, Trump has doubled down on the very policies that fueled his rise, blocking any real departure from the status quo.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the policy platform of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, arguing that his proposals are less radical than critics claim. Policies such as a rent freeze, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been implemented or tested in other jurisdictions with some success. For example, rent freezes have occurred previously in NYC, and fare-free bus pilots in other cities have boosted ridership. The piece suggests Mamdani's agenda is not about a complete government takeover but about using tested, targeted interventions to make government work better and improve residents' quality of life.</p>

This event marks a public reconciliation between the two after a contentious presidential primary, uniting them over a hardline immigration policy.

          <p>The U.S. government's public health guidance, once a global standard, is facing a crisis of credibility due to politically motivated alterations and removals of scientific information. Under the Trump administration, federal health websites have seen data on climate change disappear and disclaimers added to pages on gender and sexuality that contradict the site's own evidence-based content.

          <p>A significant ideological gap is growing between young men and women globally, a trend starkly exemplified in South Korea. In the country's recent presidential election, a large majority of men in their 20s and 30s voted for conservative candidates, in sharp contrast to their female peers. Experts attribute this divide to a male backlash against feminism, coupled with economic anxieties in a hypercompetitive job market.

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve President Trump's lawsuit against the CBS program "60 Minutes," which he accused of biased editing. The decision has caused anger within CBS News, with many journalists viewing it as a capitulation to clear the way for Paramount's merger with Skydance Media. However, there is also a sense of relief, as the settlement did not include a public apology, which was a major concern for the news division. The outcome highlights the tension between corporate interests and journalistic independence in a highly polarized media environment.</p>

          <p>State and local records reveal that federal contractors cleaning up debris from the Eaton and Palisades wildfires improperly sent asbestos-contaminated waste to nonhazardous landfills in the Los Angeles area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its contractor, Environmental Chemical Corp., failed to review asbestos test results before shipping the debris. This lapse exposed landfill workers, who were not wearing adequate respiratory protection, to potentially harmful materials. The incident has intensified concerns among environmental groups and residents about the safety protocols for handling and disposing of toxic wildfire debris.</p>

In several recent incidents, residents have called 911 to report kidnappings after witnessing plainclothes ICE agents, often in unmarked vehicles, detaining individuals. When LAPD officers arrive, their role has often been to manage crowds rather than interfere with the federal operations, sparking accusations that they are tacitly supporting ICE. The confusion has prompted calls for new protocols to verify agents' identities and ensure transparency, as the city grapples with the aggressive federal crackdown.</p>

The bill also proposes significant reductions to Medicaid spending, which could cause millions to lose health insurance, despite presidential assurances to the contrary.

          <p>Democratic Representative Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania detailed his opposition to the major Republican-led budget and tax reconciliation bill currently moving through the House. In an interview with NPR, Deluzio articulated the Democratic perspective on the legislation, which includes massive tax cuts offset by significant reductions in social programs like Medicaid. He discussed the potential negative impacts on his constituents and the broader American public. The conversation also explored how Democrats plan to leverage their opposition to the bill as a key issue in upcoming elections, framing it as a betrayal of working families.</p>

          <h2>Managing Blood Sugar 'Dips' Could Aid in Weight Loss and Improve Mood, Research Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors on people without diabetes has identified a pattern where blood sugar plummets a few hours after a meal, which scientists call a "dip." These dips are linked to increased hunger, higher calorie consumption throughout the day, and feelings of fatigue and low alertness. Nutrition experts suggest that individuals can manage these fluctuations by not eating carbohydrates alone, instead pairing them with protein, fat, and fiber. Spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day and eating them last during a meal can also help stabilize blood sugar levels.</p>

          <h2>Republican Governors Remain Largely Silent on Proposed Medicaid Cuts in Trump's Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike the vocal opposition in 2017, Republican governors in states that expanded Medicaid are now mostly silent as Congress moves to pass deep cuts to the program. President Trump's legislative package includes approximately $1 trillion in Medicaid reductions over ten years, which would create significant budget shortfalls in their states. This silence provides political cover for GOP lawmakers supporting the bill. The shift is attributed to a more conservative cohort of governors and the fact that the current bill's scope is broader than just healthcare, encompassing tax cuts and border security.</p>
