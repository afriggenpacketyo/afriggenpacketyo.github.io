          <p>China and Russia are using the 80th anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany to signal their defiance of Western pressure. Observers note that the event is designed to project the "unbreakable" bond between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Military parades planned in both Beijing and Washington are seen as displays of national pride, revealing how historical memory surrounding World War II has become a potent tool for political agendas and a battleground for narratives and influence. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow underscores the strengthening ties between the two nations amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a Utah man on death row for 37 years, are arguing that his severe dementia prevents him from understanding why he faces execution. Menzies was sentenced to death in 1988 for the murder of Maurine Hunsaker. The judge will decide Menzies' competency within 60 days, with medical experts offering conflicting opinions. The case raises questions about whether executing someone who cannot rationally understand their punishment aligns with societal retribution goals, referencing Supreme Court rulings barring executions of individuals with severe mental illness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump believes that the Fed should cut rates to counteract a potential economic slowdown resulting from his trade policies. The Fed, however, is hesitant to lower rates due to concerns that Trump's tariffs could spark inflation. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions will not be influenced by political pressure and will solely focus on economic data and outlook.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in children's lives due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancy, and the rising costs of child care. They provide numerous benefits, including better educational and mental health outcomes for children. However, grandparents are also increasingly stepping in to fill gaps in America’s child care system, which can be a burden. Experts suggest policymakers should implement reforms that allow grandparents to spend time with their grandkids because they want to, not because they have no other choice.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of a trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, and vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump.

Starmer has steadfastly refused to criticize Trump, either on trade or his statements about Ukraine and its war with Russia.

          <p>The British government has made faster economic growth its top mission, and securing a trade deal with the United States is a welcome win. However, the agreement is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement and there are limits to how much it would support the British economy. The Bank of England cut interest rates, citing concerns about lingering price pressures and a short-term bump in inflation expected this year. The uncertainty created by Trump’s trade policy globally, rather than tariffs on Britain, is the greater threat to Britain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term is marked by the betrayal of key campaign promises, leading to disillusionment among his supporters. The article argues that Trump's transactional approach and conflicting assurances on issues like tariffs and foreign policy have created a web of disappointment. From alienating business leaders with protectionist measures to upsetting pro-Palestinian voters with pro-Israel actions, Trump is facing the consequences of his impossible promises and narrow electoral victory.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is criticized for failing to meaningfully reduce federal spending, despite initial promises. The article argues that DOGE's claimed savings are exaggerated and that its focus on small targets has had little impact on the overall budget. The author contends that DOGE serves primarily to purge the civil service, reward MAGA voters, and grant Musk access to sensitive government data, rather than achieve genuine cost reductions.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is promoting Meta AI, a new app integrated into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which uses Meta's open-source Llama models. The app features a social feed of AI prompts, raising privacy concerns as it taps into user profiles for personalization. Experts warn that this “personalized” approach equates to surveillance. Zuckerberg envisions AI as a solution to loneliness, suggesting AI-generated accounts could become virtual friends, and as a new frontier for advertising, potentially leading to a feed dominated by AI-generated content and ads.</p>

          <p>Despite the prevalence of hard-line ideologues in President Trump's second term, certain establishment figures are regaining influence. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, has sidelined trade hardliners, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, has secured key foreign policy roles. This dynamic suggests a tug-of-war between dueling factions on economic and foreign policy. Trump's willingness to turn to establishment figures indicates a recognition of the need for stability amidst disruption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's choice of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer, as his nominee for surgeon general has raised eyebrows due to her unconventional background and alignment with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health agenda. While Means advocates for metabolic health and dietary changes, she has also expressed skepticism about vaccines. Experts question her fit for the role, citing her previous reservations about Kennedy's views.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he is “uncertain” about the condition of three of 24 hostages previously believed to be alive in Hamas captivity in Gaza. This follows comments from US President Trump, who stated 21 hostages were alive. Families of the hostages have urged Netanyahu to halt his plans to expand Israel's offensive in Gaza and instead agree a deal with Hamas. Despite conflicting statements, the Israeli military has said that the return of the hostages is the top priority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom are anticipated to unveil a comprehensive trade agreement, potentially alleviating the impact of President Trump's tariffs and offering a political advantage to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement seeks to lower or eliminate U.S. import taxes on U.K. cars and steel, while Britain aims to maintain its food standards, rejecting imports of chlorine-rinsed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Starmer's government views the deal as validation of its conciliatory approach toward President Trump, in contrast to the European Union's retaliatory tariffs. While this agreement is symbolically important, it may not fully address the underlying trade deficit concerns that prompted the initial tariffs.</p>
