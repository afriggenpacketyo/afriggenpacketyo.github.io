          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after finisher medals and merchandise for the event mistakenly featured an aerial view of Sunderland and the River Wear instead of the correct route through Newcastle and the River Tyne. Approximately 60,000 participants in the half-marathon received the erroneous items. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company acknowledged the mistake, humorously suggesting it made the items a unique keepsake and joking, "Wear sorry!". The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, admitted he also failed to spot the error despite closely examining the designs.</p>

          <p>In Kathmandu, Nepal, police opened fire on tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting a government ban on major social media platforms, reportedly resulting in at least 14 deaths and numerous injuries. The protests erupted after authorities blocked platforms like Facebook and X for failing to register and submit to government oversight. Protesters breached security perimeters around the Parliament building, leading to a police response with tear gas, water cannons, and eventually live ammunition. The government has since imposed a curfew in key areas of the capital amid the ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the U.S. government could be forced to issue refunds totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan. The administration is seeking an expedited ruling to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs illegal. While Bessent expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, he acknowledged the significant financial disruption a negative ruling would cause for the Treasury. The administration is also reportedly preparing backup plans, such as using other legal authorities to implement sector-specific levies if the current tariffs are struck down.

Rodgers delivered a strong performance, throwing for 244 yards and four touchdowns, marking his second consecutive game with four touchdown passes. When asked if the win was more significant because Jets' head coach Aaron Glenn had previously suggested Rodgers wasn't a good fit for the team, he quipped, "I was happy to beat everybody associated with the Jets." He added that his main goal was to enjoy the game with his new teammates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a prolonged slump, forcing many sellers to lower their asking prices and offer concessions due to a shortage of affordable buyers. High home values and mortgage rates have priced many shoppers out of the market, leading to an increase in housing inventory, particularly in the South and West. This shift gives buyers more negotiating power, a stark contrast to the bidding wars of recent years.

          <p>Recent changes to U.S. COVID-19 vaccine guidelines, which restrict eligibility primarily to those 65 and older or with underlying conditions, are causing widespread anxiety among Americans. Many younger, healthy individuals now find it difficult to get vaccinated, raising fears about their own health and the safety of their vulnerable loved ones. The article highlights personal stories of people concerned about protecting immunocompromised family members or avoiding illness during major life events. The new policy has complicated what was once a routine process, forcing many to navigate insurance hurdles or consider paying out-of-pocket for protection.</p>

This has created a cycle where applicants use AI to generate résumés to apply for more jobs, which in turn prompts employers to rely more heavily on AI filters.

          <p>In manufacturing towns like Fall River, Massachusetts, President Trump's sweeping tariffs are being met with skepticism and are failing to spark the promised industrial revival. Local business owners report that the tariffs have increased the costs of imported supplies, forcing them to cut investments and raise prices rather than expand operations. Despite an increase in inquiries for U.S.-based production, many are hesitant to invest due to hiring difficulties and doubts about the long-term sustainability of the policy. This on-the-ground reality contrasts with White House rhetoric, as national manufacturing payrolls have recently shrunk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to restore the Department of Defense's original name, the Department of War, is being criticized as more than a symbolic change. This article argues that the move reflects a deeper shift towards an openly aggressive and interventionist foreign policy, aligning with a revived "warrior ethos." Despite Trump's campaign promises to end wars, his administration has already launched military strikes in Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, and bombed Iranian facilities. The name change, therefore, is seen as an honest reflection of a department that has historically waged undeclared wars rather than focusing purely on defense.</p>

          <p>A former anesthetist, Frédéric Péchier, is on trial in Besançon, France, accused of intentionally poisoning 30 patients between 2008 and 2017, resulting in 12 deaths. Prosecutors allege that Péchier, 53, tampered with intravenous medicine bags to induce cardiac arrests in otherwise healthy patients, possibly as a way to demonstrate his skills or seek revenge against colleagues. The investigation began in 2017 after a patient survived a cardiac arrest and was found to have a potassium dose 100 times higher than expected. Péchier maintains his innocence, and the complex trial is expected to last over three months.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has unveiled an ambitious plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The strategy involves developing at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas. By 2027, the government aims to establish a framework for integrating AI, identifying over 10 pilot projects and 100 application scenarios. The initiative also includes creating AI innovation platforms and training specialists to drive breakthroughs in core technologies and achieve progress in smart energy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence has generated concerns about job displacement, labor economists argue that its current impact on the broader labor market remains relatively small. Experts suggest that the recent slowdown in hiring and general job market turbulence are more attributable to widespread economic uncertainty, particularly regarding the Trump administration's policies. Although some AI-driven layoffs have occurred, they have been largely confined to the tech industry. Instead of replacing workers, many employers are showing more interest in retraining their current workforce and are creating more demand for employees who possess AI-related skills.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the center-left's "Abundance" movement, which advocates for progress in housing, energy, and infrastructure, is fundamentally unworkable. The author argues it cannot succeed because it requires an alliance with a far-left faction that is ideologically opposed to growth and fantasizes about violence against the very centrists promoting the agenda. Furthermore, the political system itself, reliant on unions and bureaucratic processes, is structurally incentivized against the kind of rapid, efficient building that defines abundance. True progress, the article contends, requires a concentration of power that is at odds with the left's current values.</p>

          <p>As President Trump threatens to send federal troops to U.S. cities to combat crime, Baltimore is presenting a contrasting case study. The city has seen a significant drop in homicides by focusing on community-violence-intervention programs, even as the Trump administration has cut funding for such initiatives. Local leaders like Mayor Brandon Scott argue that these rehabilitative, data-driven approaches are more effective than the "big show of force" strategy being deployed in Washington, D.C. This highlights a national debate over the best way to ensure public safety: through military-style enforcement or targeted, community-based solutions.</p>

          <p>The French government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, is facing a confidence vote in the National Assembly that it is widely expected to lose. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's proposed €44 billion in public spending cuts for 2026, aimed at tackling the country's rising debt and deficit. Opposition from both the far-right and far-left appears strong enough to topple the fragile coalition government. A defeat would deepen France's political instability and further weaken President Emmanuel Macron's ability to govern domestically, forcing him to appoint a sixth prime minister since 2024.</p>
