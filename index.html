          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his intention to step down, citing his party's failure to secure a majority in the recent lower house election. The decision comes after weeks of pressure and a report from his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that blamed the election loss on unpopular inflation measures and political scandals. Ishiba stated he timed his resignation to coincide with the delivery of a new U.S. tariff agreement, which imposes a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese goods. He expressed a wish for the LDP to overcome its internal divisions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing sharp criticism from Democratic leaders after a social media post that appeared to threaten military action and deportations in Chicago. The post included an AI-generated image parodying the film "Apocalypse Now" and stated, "Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR." Governors and senators, including Gavin Newsom and Tammy Duckworth, condemned the rhetoric as dangerous and an inappropriate use of the military against an American city. The controversy arises amid ongoing disputes over the potential deployment of the National Guard to address crime in Chicago.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create animated videos of biblical stories, which have gained significant traction online, particularly with younger audiences. The videos, styled like action movies or video games, have garnered millions of views, with the company aiming to be the "Marvel Universe of faith." However, the approach has drawn criticism from some theologians who argue that it reduces complex religious texts to mere entertainment, potentially stripping them of their spiritual depth. This development highlights the ongoing intersection of modern technology and ancient faith traditions.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, creating a "Blood Moon" spectacle visible to sky-watchers in many parts of the United Kingdom. The Moon will pass through Earth's shadow, taking on a reddish hue due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. While the full eclipse lasts for over an hour, visibility in the UK will be limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern regions getting the best view. Astronomers advise finding a clear horizon to observe the event, which is the last total lunar eclipse visible from the UK until August 2026.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his technological skills, he created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The canonization process was fast-tracked after two miracles were attributed to him, a move seen as an effort by the Vatican to connect with younger generations. His story, blending modern interests like video games with deep faith, has resonated with young Catholics globally.</p>

          <p>An analysis from Carson Group notes that President Donald Trump's second term broke a 75-year historical trend, as the S&P 500 saw a gain in August of a post-election year, unlike the previous six second-term presidents. While recent market highs are fueled by optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and AI advancements, significant headwinds remain. These include historically high stock valuations, as measured by the Shiller P/E ratio, and economic uncertainty surrounding the president's tariff policies, which could risk reigniting inflation. Long-term data suggests market growth is probable over extended periods despite short-term volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The new Chien Feng IV suicide drones reportedly have a range of at least 1,000 km, enabling them to reach major cities deep within mainland China.

          <p>This opinion article argues that world leaders who attempt to appease President Donald Trump, such as India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron, ultimately fail to secure lasting benefits and often face betrayal. The author contends that Trump respects strength and responds poorly to supplication, citing leaders like Brazil's Lula da Silva who have found success through resistance. The piece criticizes UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approach ahead of Trump's state visit, suggesting it positions Britain as a subservient state without gaining meaningful concessions.
