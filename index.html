          <p>Human cases of West Nile virus are surging across the United States, running approximately 40% higher than the average for this time of year. According to CDC data, there have been around 770 cases reported, with nearly 500 classified as severe, which can lead to serious neurological conditions like meningitis or encephalitis. The virus is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, and while most infections are mild or asymptomatic, the spike in severe cases is causing concern among health officials. Experts recommend preventative measures such as using insect repellent and eliminating standing water to reduce mosquito breeding grounds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has advocated for public companies to report their earnings every six months instead of quarterly, a change he argues would save money and encourage long-term strategic planning over short-term gains. This proposal has been met with concern from many financial experts and investor advocates, who warn that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency and increase opportunities for accounting fraud or insider trading. Proponents, including some corporate executives, believe the current quarterly system creates undue pressure to meet short-term targets. Any change to the decades-old practice would require a lengthy review and approval process by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud provider CoreWeave jumped significantly after the company disclosed a major purchase agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. The deal obligates Nvidia to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold computing capacity through April 2032, signaling a strong, long-term partnership between the two tech firms. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia, relies heavily on its GPUs to power its AI services for clients like Google and Microsoft. This news has propelled the company's valuation to over $58 billion since its public offering earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are discovering their loan servicers have been changed without clear, direct notification, leading to confusion and potential financial issues. One common problem is that loans are automatically placed in administrative forbearance during the transfer, which can cause interest to accrue unexpectedly if borrowers are not vigilant. Experts advise borrowers to save their payment amounts during the transition period rather than sending them, as payments can get lost. It is also recommended to carefully monitor both old and new servicer accounts and check credit reports to ensure no payments were incorrectly marked as late.</p>

          <p>The man arrested for the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, reportedly had an 'obsession' with him, according to the FBI. Investigators found evidence that Robinson had been tracking Kirk's public appearances online and had familiarized himself with the event location at Utah Valley University. DNA evidence from the crime scene has also linked Robinson to the killing. The suspect was apprehended after his father recognized him in photos released by authorities and convinced him to turn himself in, an act praised by officials.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which have been steadily declining and recently hit a near one-year low, may drop further this week in anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Lenders often preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive when a Fed adjustment is widely expected. While a 25-basis-point reduction is likely, a more significant 50-basis-point cut could lead to a sharper plunge in mortgage rates. Prospective homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely, but experts also stress the importance of a strong credit score to qualify for the most favorable rates being offered.

The purchase comes as shareholders prepare to vote on a new compensation package for Musk that could make him the world's first trillionaire if the company achieves a series of ambitious performance targets over the next decade.

Those affected include a sports reporter, a university employee, and an MSNBC analyst, whose employers deemed their comments inappropriate or harmful to the company's reputation. Legal experts note that private employers generally have the right to terminate employees for public speech that violates workplace policies, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector.

While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operational and fuel costs are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, which are subject to price volatility. The report considers how tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act further lower renewable energy costs, though new legislation under the Trump administration aims to phase out these credits while expanding support for oil and gas.

The recent firing of Black columnists, such as The Washington Post's Karen Attiah for her social media posts following Charlie Kirk's killing, is presented as a key example of this trend. The author contends that Black journalists are often the most willing to frankly discuss America's shortcomings and that their diminishing presence in mainstream media weakens the press's ability to honestly cover threats to democracy.</p>

The author contrasts the current political weaponization of the tragedy with the shared sense of national mourning that followed assassinations in the 1960s. The article contends that the event is being used as a pretext to undermine First Amendment protections and create a climate of fear, where people are censured or fired for expressing views critical of Kirk's rhetoric.

He describes the profound trauma of repeatedly covering stories of young men who looked like him and wrestling with seeing himself in the victims.

          <p>This article analyzes the assassination of Charlie Kirk as a defining event in the era of influencer politics and reaction-video culture. It positions Kirk and his leftist counterpart, streamer Hasan Piker, as entertainers who shaped political discourse through a performative and often confrontational style. The author reflects on how Piker processed the news live on his stream, grappling with the real-world violence that threatens the very online world he inhabits. The piece suggests that Kirk's death may have a chilling effect on face-to-face political debate, further pushing discourse into a virtual realm where dehumanization can fester.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals a concerning trend in household finances, as the median amount Americans have in emergency savings has dropped to just $500, down from $600 a year ago. The data suggests that rising prices and inflation are stretching budgets thin, leaving less room for saving and increasing financial precarity for many. Financial advisors typically recommend saving three to six months' worth of living expenses, but even smaller amounts can significantly improve financial well-being. This decline in savings indicates that a growing number of households are vulnerable to unexpected expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

The union alleges that the Department of Education is unlawfully denying or delaying borrowers' access to affordable income-driven repayment plans and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. According to court records, over a million applications for these programs are caught in a massive backlog. The AFT argues that these delays are actively harming borrowers who are legally entitled to debt relief.</p>

He criticized his former party for a 'rule of failure' that resulted in bigger government and social decline.

The achievement comes as the company navigates new competition in the artificial intelligence space and continues to face regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. (not investment advice)</p>
