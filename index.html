        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the boom in data centers driven by artificial intelligence, quantum computing is emerging as the next major catalyst for the commercial real estate sector. As the technology advances toward commercial viability, a significant need for specialized real estate is anticipated, with analysts predicting a potential breakthrough around 2030 that could trigger tens of billions in investments. Unlike traditional data centers, quantum computers require unique infrastructure, such as electromagnetic shielding, suggesting a new wave of development and redevelopment for properties in research-heavy hubs like Chicago and Boston. This development is seen as accretive, creating new opportunities rather than making existing data centers obsolete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for living expenses, several strategic options exist. Financial planners suggest reinvesting the money into a brokerage account, often favoring tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for long-term growth. Another popular choice is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit to satisfy RMD requirements. For those focused on legacy planning, using the withdrawal to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members can also be a beneficial move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A British Army service inquiry has found that the use of sex workers by soldiers stationed at the Batuk base in Kenya is still occurring at a "low to moderate level," despite a 2022 ban. The investigation was launched amid ongoing scrutiny of troop conduct, notably following the 2021 reopening of an investigation into the 2012 death of Agnes Wanjiru, who was allegedly killed by a British soldier. The report identified 35 suspected cases since the ban was instituted, prompting recommendations for stricter enforcement, including making it easier to dismiss soldiers found to have paid for sex. Separately, a soldier was sent back to the UK in June after being accused of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Trump and Newsom administrations are in a federal court showdown in California over the president's authority to deploy the National Guard. The case, brought by California, argues that Trump's use of military forces to quell immigration riots in Los Angeles violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. The federal government contends the president acted within his legal authority to address attacks on federal officers. The trial, presided over by Judge Charles Breyer, is expected to set a major precedent on the scope of a president's commander-in-chief powers.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Anne Lamott reflects on navigating the current political climate, which she describes as a terrifying time. She argues that the antidote to the overwhelming cruelty and absurdity is not just activism but also laughter, joy, and small acts of kindness. Drawing on the humor of Monty Python and a personal anecdote from a nail salon, Lamott suggests that embracing absurdity and practicing kindness can be powerful forms of resistance. She concludes that doing hopeful things, like singing and helping others, is the best way to maintain hope and sanity.</p>

          <h2>Viral Rant From Real Estate Agent Blames Systemic Issues for Housing Crisis</h2>

          <p>A passionate TikTok video by Delaware real estate agent Zachary Foust has gone viral for its detailed explanation of the modern housing crisis. Foust argues that decades of policy, including tax cuts for the wealthy and the rise of private equity, have systematically disadvantaged the working class. He points to the "infestation of institutional investors" who purchase homes as assets, driving up prices and preventing average people from achieving the American Dream of homeownership. Foust's rant connects these economic trends to a broader erosion of opportunity for everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his public feud with his former company OpenAI and its partner, Apple. In a series of posts, Musk threatened legal action against Apple, claiming it unfairly favors OpenAI's ChatGPT in its App Store, and called OpenAI CEO Sam Altman a "liar." The conflict stems from Musk's belief that OpenAI has abandoned its founding non-profit mission to instead pursue profits with major investor Microsoft. This latest confrontation adds to a history of lawsuits and social media digs between the competing tech billionaires.</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old woman in Palm Beach, Florida, has been charged with making a false report after she lied to police to cover for her 14-year-old son.

The woman arrived at the scene and told officers she was the one behind the wheel, but surveillance footage from a neighbor's home later confirmed the teen was the sole occupant and driver of the vehicle at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>Everton has completed the signing of Manchester City and England winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old playmaker, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, fell out of favor last season and is looking to rejuvenate his career with more consistent playing time. Grealish said that conversations with manager David Moyes were decisive in his move to the club. He hopes the move will help him regain his spot in the England national squad after being left out of the 2024 European Championship.</p>

While laptops and tablets are still welcome, the company aims to ensure seating is available for all customers.
