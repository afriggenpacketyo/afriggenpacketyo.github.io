          <p>Verizon has named former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman as its new chief executive, succeeding Hans Vestberg, who has led the telecommunications company since 2018. Schulman, who has served on Verizon's board since 2018, is credited with significantly growing PayPal's revenue and customer base during his tenure. The leadership change comes as Verizon aims to redefine its strategy, focusing on increasing market share and delivering long-term growth for shareholders, while also finalizing its acquisition of Frontier Communications. Vestberg will remain on the board and serve as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

The incident, which resulted in Sanchez being hospitalized with stab wounds, allegedly began as a dispute over a parked truck with a 69-year-old man who sustained severe injuries. Sanchez also faces several misdemeanor charges, including public intoxication, after allegedly instigating the confrontation that prompted the other man to act in what he described to police as self-defense.</p>

          <p>Chicago's police superintendent, Larry Snelling, has issued a stern warning that intentionally ramming law enforcement vehicles will be treated as an act of deadly force, justifying a similar response from officers. His comments came after two separate incidents over the weekend where federal agents' vehicles were struck by other cars during protests, leading to one suspect being shot and wounded. Snelling refuted reports that Chicago police were ordered to "stand down" during the events, providing a timeline to show his officers responded and were even exposed to tear gas deployed by federal agents.</p>

          <p>A senior federal prosecutor in Virginia is reportedly resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to bring a criminal indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to MSNBC, prosecutor Elizabeth Yusi has found no probable cause to believe James committed mortgage fraud, an allegation promoted by a Trump appointee. This development highlights ongoing tensions between the White House and the Justice Department, particularly as the same U.S. Attorney's office recently indicted former FBI Director James Comey, another frequent target of the president's criticism.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates and more reductions anticipated, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are becoming a more affordable financing option for homeowners. A new analysis calculates the potential monthly payments for a $150,000 HELOC, showing costs are now lower than in previous months, with a 15-year term costing around $1,424 per month at current rates. The article explains that because HELOCs have variable rates, future Fed cuts could further decrease borrowing costs for homeowners looking to leverage their equity. (not investment advice)</p>

The law, aimed at reducing severe prison overcrowding, covers offenses such as corruption and theft, and even some terrorism-related crimes, though it excludes those convicted of killings. Spearheaded by Sunni lawmakers who claim their community has been unfairly targeted by terrorism charges, the legislation also allows for retrials in cases where confessions may have been coerced, and has resulted in the recovery of over $34 million in restitution.</p>

          <p>To qualify for a reverse mortgage, senior homeowners typically need to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property, though this is not a strict FHA rule. The actual amount a homeowner can borrow is not the full equity amount but is instead determined by factors such as the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. For those who don't meet the equity threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting for the home's value to appreciate, or considering a HECM for Purchase to downsize into a new home.</p>

          <p>The Bread and Puppet Theater, a political performance troupe founded in 1963, continues its mission to "make the revolution irresistible" with its annual cross-country tour. Known for its giant puppets and presence at anti-war protests for decades, the group's current show addresses contemporary issues like the war in Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, alongside anti-capitalist themes. Despite concerns about free expression in the current political climate, the puppeteers, led by 91-year-old founder Peter Schumann, remain committed to their ethos of using art to provoke thought and inspire action.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying in the Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is forecast to become a Category 2 hurricane within the next few days. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Baja California Sur as the storm is expected to move parallel to the coast, bringing heavy rains and dangerous surf conditions. While Priscilla's center is predicted to remain offshore, its outer bands could cause flash flooding in coastal and higher-terrain areas before the storm begins to weaken by midweek.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified resident doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly in favor of strike action due to a severe shortage of specialty training positions available after their second year. The British Medical Association union highlights that this year, there were only 10,000 training jobs for 30,000 applicants, leaving many skilled doctors unable to advance their careers despite high patient demand. The union argues that poor workforce planning has failed to create enough NHS training posts to match the expansion of medical school enrollment, creating a bottleneck in the system.</p>

Goodall also named Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Benjamin Netanyahu as others she would place on the spaceship, using her lifetime of behavioral study to critique the aggressive and intimidating tactics employed by certain powerful human leaders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package of more than $10 billion for U.S. farmers, with a particular focus on soybean producers. Farmers have been severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans, a direct consequence of the ongoing trade dispute. Top economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed that discussions are underway to implement "big measures" soon to address the financial strain on the agricultural sector. The potential relief could be funded by revenue collected from tariffs imposed by the administration.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has suspended the release of crucial economic data, including the monthly jobs report and upcoming inflation figures, creating a "data vacuum" for policymakers and investors. Economists warn that this lack of information comes at a precarious time, as recent trends have shown a hiring slowdown and rising inflation, stoking fears of a potential recession. The absence of reliable government statistics heightens economic risk by forcing businesses, consumers, and the Federal Reserve to make decisions without a clear picture of the nation's financial health.</p>

The lawsuit follows the administration's announcement to send troops to Chicago to protect federal facilities from protesters, a move that Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has labeled an attempt to create a "war zone" for political purposes.</p>

          <p>The domestic box office is projected to surpass $9 billion in 2025, potentially reaching its highest total since the pandemic began, thanks to a strong lineup of winter releases. After a slower fall season, upcoming blockbusters like Disney's "Tron: Ares," Universal's "Wicked: For Good," and "Avatar: Fire and Ash" are expected to drive significant ticket sales. Analysts predict this momentum will push the year's total revenue above the $9.05 billion mark set in 2023, signaling a continued recovery for the theatrical industry. (not investment advice)</p>
