          <p>Zions Bancorporation's stock plummeted, wiping out $1 billion in value after it revealed $60 million in loans were unlikely to be repaid. The disclosure sparked a wider sell-off in regional bank stocks, fueled by fears of broader credit quality issues across the sector. A lawsuit filed by Zions' subsidiary alleges that borrowers engaged in a "sweeping betrayal of trust," secretly subordinating the loans and eliminating the collateral that was meant to secure them. The issue came to light after a related fund was sued for fraud by another bank, prompting Zions to investigate its own exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, following continued scrutiny over his connection to the late Jeffrey Epstein. The decision comes after excerpts from a posthumous memoir by accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked to the prince, were published. Andrew has consistently denied the allegations, which led to a civil lawsuit that was settled out of court in 2022. While he will remain a prince by birthright, he is stepping further back from public life to prevent the accusations from distracting from the Royal Family's work.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump proposed that both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory and cease fighting, stating it is "time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL!" During their discussion, Zelenskyy indicated they decided not to publicly address Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles to avoid escalating the conflict. Trump expressed reservations about providing the weapons but also mentioned a potential trade of Ukrainian drones for the missiles. The meeting occurred as Trump prepares for a separate summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest.</p>

          <p>Organizers are preparing for nationwide "No Kings" protests, with gatherings planned in over 2,500 locations across the United States to oppose President Trump and his policies. In response, Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have placed National Guard troops on standby, citing concerns over potential unrest. Protest organizers state the demonstrations aim to challenge what they describe as Trump's "authoritarianism," while some of the president's allies have labeled the events "Hate America" rallies. The movement has also inspired solidarity protests in several European cities, including Berlin, Madrid, and Rome.</p>

          <p>In an increasingly competitive job market, applicants are using artificial intelligence tools to create professional headshots at a fraction of the cost of traditional photography. Services like InstaHeadshots and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished profile pictures for platforms like LinkedIn, with some users reporting a significant increase in recruiter outreach after updating their photos. However, the trend raises ethical questions about authenticity, as career experts and recruiters express concerns that poorly done AI images can appear inauthentic.

He is accused of coordinating a group of fighters and his phone location was traced near Kibbutz Kfar Aza, the site of a massacre.

Organizations like "Mental Health Is Real Wealth" in Los Angeles host meetings where men can be vulnerable without judgment, addressing pressures to appear strong and the unique challenges they face. These groups serve as a crucial gateway to therapy, as Black men are less likely to seek professional help and often receive culturally incompetent care when they do.

Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships that have narrower criteria, which reduces the competition pool. She also suggests that students should treat the process as a numbers game, recommending applying for 100 to 200 scholarships to maximize their chances of success.</p>

Parents should proactively teach children about online safety, privacy, and the value of their time away from screens. Once a device is introduced, Twenge stresses the importance of establishing clear boundaries, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight and using parental controls to manage usage and content.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types and clarifies why he avoids commodities like gold. He describes the first category, currency-denominated assets like bonds, as a bet on government stability that typically loses value over time. The second, non-productive assets like gold, rely solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them in the future without creating any intrinsic value. Buffett states his preference for the third category: productive assets, such as farms or businesses, which are valued based on the output they can generate, making them a more rational and tangible investment.</p>

          <p>A global movement to redesign city streets is gaining momentum, with urban centers like New York, London, and Montreal expanding their networks of protected bike lanes to make cycling a safer and more attractive mode of transportation. By physically separating cyclists from car traffic, redesigning intersections, and tweaking traffic signals, cities are encouraging more residents to choose two wheels over four. This shift not only reduces carbon emissions and noise pollution but also offers significant health benefits and saves residents money. The rise of e-bikes is further expanding the accessibility of cycling, contributing to a broader transformation towards more livable and sustainable cities.</p>

          <p>A significant political gender divide is emerging among Generation Z in the United States, with young women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in recent history. Many Gen Z women reject the "liberal" label in favor of "leftist," viewing the Democratic party as too centrist and compromised by corporate interests. This political stance is shaped by coming of age amidst economic instability, climate change, and threats to reproductive rights, leading them to see politics as a form of self-defense. In contrast, Gen Z men's political views are more aligned with the national average, a gap potentially widened by social media algorithms amplifying different content to each gender.</p>

His nomination has alarmed public health and environmental advocates, who fear it will lead to deregulation and weaken protections against toxic substances. If confirmed, Troutman would be the fourth former industry lobbyist to hold a top position in the EPA's toxics office. Critics point to his past efforts to repeal a California law requiring the disclosure of chemicals in cleaning products as evidence that he will prioritize industry interests over public safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the more than seven-year prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, who will be released immediately. Santos had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft charges and began serving his sentence in July. In a social media post, Trump stated that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison, including being held in solitary confinement. Santos' attorney expressed gratitude for the commutation, while other Republican figures, like Congressman Nick LaLota, criticized the decision, arguing Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not erase the conviction.</p>

          <p>As the U.S.-China trade war continues, China is actively working to mitigate its economic dependence on the United States. Beijing has responded to U.S. tariffs with its own countermeasures, including export restrictions on critical rare-earth minerals and a halt on soybean purchases. Furthermore, China has successfully redirected exports to other regions, with shipments to Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America increasing significantly. The nation is also reducing its financial ties by lowering its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, though experts note that the deep economic interdependence between the two powers, or "Chimerica," remains resilient despite the ongoing tensions.</p>

While President Trump has not confirmed plans to overthrow Maduro, his administration's focus on the Monroe Doctrine and "maximum pressure" has intensified the situation.

The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women and that remarried households often have a higher median net worth than those of divorced, single adults. While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the phenomenon of "gray divorce" among those over 50 remains a notable exception, though its rate has recently leveled off.

          <p>This article argues that the "cringe" or earnest idealism of the anti-Trump Resistance movement, often dismissed by cynics, is actually a potent political tool against authoritarianism. While the movement's aesthetics, like pink hats, were mocked during Trump's first term, its on-the-ground organizing led to concrete victories, such as the 2018 midterm "blue wave." As the "No Kings" protests gain momentum during Trump's second term, the article posits that sincere, community-based action is an effective antidote to the nihilism and cynicism that authoritarianism thrives on. It suggests that embracing earnestness, while focusing on local, practical organizing, is the most effective form of opposition.</p>
