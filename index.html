          <p>Apple reported a profit of $24.78 billion, a 4.8 percent increase from a year ago, alongside a 5 percent rise in sales to $95.36 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that tariffs would cost the company an estimated $900 million in the current quarter, leading Apple to revamp its supply chain by assembling the majority of iPhones sold in the United States in India, and Macs, iPads, and AirPods in Vietnam. Apple is also facing antitrust scrutiny, including a recent ruling rebuking the company for its App Store commission practices and a separate case involving Google's payments to be the default search engine on iPhones, potentially impacting services revenue. The article also notes delays in the rollout of Apple's new AI system, Apple Intelligence, citing the need for more time to meet quality standards.</p>

          <p>Leaders overseeing California's high-speed rail project are expressing concerns about its financial future as they await word from the Trump administration regarding federal support. Board members raised alarms about the potential loss of funds from the Department of Transportation and the risks of moving forward with contracts when federal funding is uncertain. The Department of Transportation initiated a compliance review of the project in February, focusing on a $4-billion promise made under the Biden administration for construction in the Central Valley. CEO Ian Choudri emphasized the importance of private sector investment and hopes to have a financial plan in place by the end of summer.</p>

          <p>The article reviews Marvel's "Thunderbolts*," highlighting its self-awareness and punk-rock snark, which elevates supporting players like Yelena (Florence Pugh) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). The film follows a team-up of misfit characters against a corrupt CIA director. Pugh's performance is praised for her portrayal of apathy and droll line readings. The reviewer notes the film's departure from typical superhero tropes, with its messy, depressive, and defiant tone, but also acknowledges its plainness in fights. Ultimately, the movie is seen as a way to kill time until the next "Avengers" film.</p>
