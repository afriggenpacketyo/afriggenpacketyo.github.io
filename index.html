          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with the possibility of further industrial action looming. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the offer as insufficient, potentially leading to a strike ballot. According to the RCN, nursing staff in England have faced over a decade of pay erosion, resulting in increased numbers of nurses leaving the profession. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay, adding to the pressure on the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>The Broadway play "Good Night, and Good Luck" portrays the real-life events and journalists of CBS News who challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare. The play highlights the courage and integrity of figures like Edward R. Murrow, Fred Friendly, and Don Hewitt in upholding journalistic responsibility. It underscores the themes of truth, intimidation, and the importance of a free press in holding power accountable. The play also features the stories of lesser-known figures like Shirley and Joe Wershba, who played crucial roles in the network's success.</p>

          <p>Navy veteran Michael Giardina confronted childhood trauma during a psychedelic retreat in Mexico, organized by the Heroic Hearts Project. Giardina, who had an emotionally abusive father and struggled with drug use as a teenager, found the experience challenging but ultimately transformative. During the retreat, he experienced an "exorcism" and realized the need to let go of past traumas and prioritize spending time with his daughters. The Department of Veterans Affairs is now conducting clinical trials using psychedelics to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, with promising results.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses, including the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, have significantly weakened Iran's influence in the Middle East. The Mossad's operation involving explosive pagers and walkie-talkies decimated Hezbollah's leadership and disrupted its operations. This has also led to the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran. With Hezbollah weakened, Iran's proxy war strategy has suffered a major setback, requiring a reevaluation of its approach to regional power dynamics.</p>

          <p>UK energy firms are receiving substantial payments to reduce power output due to grid overload, highlighting inefficiencies in the electricity network. Wind farms like Moray East and West are being compensated for not generating power when the system cannot handle their output. Balancing the grid in this manner has already cost over Â£500 million this year, potentially reaching Â£8 billion annually by 2030. The government is considering a radical solution involving regional markets to improve efficiency and potentially lower energy bills, although this approach faces opposition and may lead to varying costs across regions.</p>

This move follows the BPI's decision to host the Mercury Prize in Newcastle, signaling a broader effort to decentralize major music ceremonies.

There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types needed to treat sickle cell disease. The appeal comes almost a year after the NHS issued an amber alert due to a "perfect storm" of unfilled appointments and increased demand.</p>
