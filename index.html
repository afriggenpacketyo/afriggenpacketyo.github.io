          <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has released a report detailing how combat sport clubs are being used to recruit members for the white nationalist group Patriot Front. These Active Clubs, smaller networks of white supremacist groups, use mixed martial arts training to bond members over white nationalist ideologies and maintain an online presence to radicalize young men. The report notes a 14% increase in hate groups since 2023, with Active Clubs present in at least 34 states.

          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the growing federal government budget deficit and increasing costs of debt rollover. This decision aligns Moody's with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, both of which had previously downgraded the U.S. credit rating. The downgrade reflects concerns that successive administrations have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits and rising interest costs. Moody's anticipates federal deficits will widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, with the federal debt burden rising to about 134% of GDP.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will achieve its target of having women occupy 30 percent of top corporate roles by 2030. The survey, which included 41 senior women, cites slow shifts in views among male-dominated executive classes and the need to change company culture as key obstacles. Despite government efforts, women held only 16.2 percent of high-level roles in Japan's top companies in 2024, trailing behind other G7 nations. Respondents pointed to traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues as reasons for the imbalance.</p>

A legal letter calls for the festivals to be cancelled and the site cleared, while the council assesses the impact of the judgment.

Critics argue the standards represent a biased perspective and were not properly reviewed. While some teachers express outrage, others believe effective instruction is still possible.

          <p>Donald Trump's recent Middle East tour resulted in multibillion-dollar tech deals with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, concentrating power in the hands of a few tech CEOs. These agreements, involving the sale of advanced US technology, potentially contradict the Biden administration's restrictions on sales to Middle Eastern powers due to concerns about ties to China. The deals stand to enrich tech CEOs by opening new markets for their products. Elon Musk's presence on the trip underscores his influence, with Starlink inking an agreement for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, experienced years of unexplained calf pain before being diagnosed with Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). After numerous doctor visits and misdiagnoses, a specialist finally identified the rare condition, which involves compression of the popliteal artery. Prindle underwent surgery to reroute blood flow, but complications led her to Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic, who performed a second surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles. Now recovered, Prindle hopes her story encourages others to persist in seeking answers for their health issues.</p>
