          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. This growth follows a 0.8% rise in the first quarter, reversing previous declines. While U.S. tariffs had reached as high as 145%, a trade truce in Geneva led to a reduction, with current tariffs at 51.1% for U.S. goods and 32.6% for Chinese imports. Despite the growth in profits, manufacturing activity fell, and exports to the U.S. declined significantly, though overall exports were boosted by shipments to Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a significant tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the high valuations and sales prices of teams. The legislation would allow owners to deduct only half the value of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, over 15 years. This tax break, which can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, has helped fuel the lofty prices that investment firms and billionaires have paid for teams. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and potentially hurt current owners' investments. (not investment advice)</p>

The research focuses on phenomena like the triple sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters and the effects of topography and weather on sound propagation. With SpaceX testing the larger Starship rocket, scientists aim to gather data to lessen disruptions before problems become entrenched. The goal is not to halt launches but to find ways to make them quieter, drawing parallels to advancements in jetliner noise reduction.</p>

          <p>The government in England is shifting its apprenticeship funding focus to under-21s, scrapping funding for postgraduate apprenticeships. Only students under 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree. The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults, funded by an increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK. This shift is intended to address the decline in entry-level apprenticeships, though critics argue it will harm public services and limit professional opportunities for those not attending university.</p>
