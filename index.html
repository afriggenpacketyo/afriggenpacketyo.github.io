          <p>Enterprise artificial intelligence firm C3 AI saw its stock fall by nearly 26% following the release of preliminary first-quarter financial results that CEO Thomas Siebel called "completely unacceptable." The company anticipates revenue to be significantly lower than the previous year and projects a wider operating loss. Siebel attributed the poor performance to a disruptive sales reorganization and his own health issues, which have prompted a search for a new CEO. Despite the downturn, Siebel expressed confidence that the company is now positioned to accelerate its growth moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of major cannabis companies, including Tilray Brands and Canopy Growth, experienced a significant rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could provide major tax benefits and stimulate institutional investment in the cannabis industry. While the president cannot unilaterally reclassify the drug, his public support has generated strong optimism among investors and industry leaders, who see it as a pivotal step toward federal reform.

          <p>The Trump administration has approved export licenses for Nvidia and AMD to sell specific AI chips to China, contingent on the companies sharing 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This unusual arrangement is seen by analysts as a transactional approach to foreign policy that provides certainty for the chipmakers, as receiving 85% of revenue is preferable to zero. While the deal helps U.S. firms compete with Chinese rivals like Huawei, it also raises long-term uncertainty about future government demands and sets a unique precedent for strategic sectors like semiconductors.

The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates. CEO Adam Aron attributed the success to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and record-high revenue per patron. The company has also restructured its debt, creating a more stable foundation to capitalize on expected industry growth into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Harvard Researchers Propose Stricter Lead Contamination Standards for Residential Soil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 16:06:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Harvard researchers argues that California's current safety standard for lead in residential soil—80 milligrams per kilogram—is not stringent enough and should be lowered to around 55 mg/kg. The paper contends the state's model for assessing health risks to children is based on outdated assumptions and doesn't fully account for lead's wide-ranging health impacts. While the debate is largely technical, it has implications for fire survivors rebuilding homes, as a stricter standard would classify more properties as contaminated. Experts advise residents to focus on mitigation strategies like soil testing and limiting direct contact.</p>

          <p>Ticketing company StubHub is moving forward with its initial public offering, now targeting a September debut after pausing its plans in April due to market volatility. The company, which was spun out of eBay, has filed an updated prospectus showing 10% revenue growth in the first quarter to $397.6 million. The resumption of its IPO plans signals renewed confidence and contributes to a recent revival in the IPO market, which has seen several major tech companies go public. StubHub faces significant competition from rivals like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats as it prepares for its listing.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's decision to place the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, focus has turned to the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act. This law grants the district local governance but retains congressional oversight and allows the president to assume control of the police for federal purposes deemed necessary. Section 740 of the act limits this emergency control to 30 days unless extended by Congress. The move has reignited debate over D.C. statehood, with proponents arguing it is the only way to ensure the city's full autonomy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the current political battle over redistricting in states like Texas stems from the Supreme Court's 2019 decision in *Rucho v. Common Cause*. The ruling declared partisan gerrymandering a "political question" beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively enabling state legislatures to draw maps that heavily favor one party without judicial review. The author contends this decision undermines democracy by allowing representatives to choose their voters, and that without a legal check, states are now engaging in retaliatory redistricting, with the Supreme Court bearing the ultimate blame for the escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>Swifties are buzzing with speculation that Taylor Swift is the "VERY special guest" set to appear on the "New Heights" podcast, hosted by her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason. A promotional graphic for the upcoming episode has fueled the rumors, with fans pointing to clues like a silhouette resembling the pop star and the brothers wearing what appears to be Eras Tour merchandise. While Swift has supported Kelce at NFL games, she has never appeared on the popular podcast, making the potential appearance a highly anticipated event for her dedicated fanbase.</p>

          <h2>Crystal Palace Demoted to Conference League After Losing Appeal Over Ownership Rules</h2>

          <p>Crystal Palace has been demoted from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League after the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected their appeal. The club was penalized by UEFA for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as its former stakeholder, John Textor, is also the majority owner of Lyon, another Europa League qualifier. Despite the setback, which came just after their Community Shield victory, some pundits suggest the demotion could galvanize the team. The ruling confirms Nottingham Forest's promotion into the Europa League to take Palace's former spot.</p>

          <p>German sportswear giant Adidas has issued a public apology after being accused of cultural appropriation over its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe. The design was inspired by traditional "huarache" sandals from the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, who were not involved in the product's creation. The issue drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the governor of Oaxaca, who emphasized the need to protect Indigenous intellectual property under a 2022 law. The shoe's designer also expressed regret, stating the intention was to honor, not appropriate, the culture.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that gold will be exempt from tariffs, directly contradicting a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would be subject to a 39% duty, a move that caused concern in the precious metals market and briefly pushed gold to a record high. Trump's declaration on social media immediately reversed this, causing gold futures to fall. The initial ruling could have impacted the international flow of physical gold used to back futures contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cave in Norway, hidden until the 1990s, has yielded an extensive collection of 75,000-year-old animal bones, providing the oldest evidence of Arctic biodiversity from a warmer period of the last Ice Age. The remains include a wide array of species, from lemmings and fish to whales and a polar bear. Scientists believe this diverse ecosystem thrived on melting glaciers but disappeared when the climate cooled again, as DNA analysis shows none of the ancient lineages survived the subsequent freeze. The findings highlight how even cold-adapted species struggle with dramatic climate shifts.</p>
