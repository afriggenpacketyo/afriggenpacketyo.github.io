          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:40:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources cited by CBS News, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained injuries during a recent Israeli attack on Iran. The report aligns with Iranian state media accounts that Pezeshkian was hurt while escaping a Supreme National Security Council meeting targeted in the strike. It remains unclear if he was the intended target, though the president had previously claimed Israel attempted to assassinate him. The White House and Israeli government have not commented on the incident, which occurred amid a 12-day conflict that also saw the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian military commanders.</p>

          <p>At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured the former Alcatraz prison to evaluate its feasibility for reopening as a high-security federal detention center. The visit, described as a fact-finding mission, involved inspecting the crumbling infrastructure of the site, which has been a national park since 1973. Bondi suggested the facility could house violent criminals and others, emphasizing its symbolic value for law and order, while acknowledging the significant restoration work and logistical challenges required. The proposal has drawn criticism from figures like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it a distraction.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures, including the 3.4-ounce limit for liquids, and suggested it could be the next major policy change. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. While no specific details or timeline were provided, the potential reform stems from the deployment of new CT scanners that provide more detailed 3D images of baggage contents.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, in a chaotic session where Democrats walked out in protest. The 12-0 vote to send Bove's nomination for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to the full Senate occurred after the Republican chairman refused to allow all Democrats to speak or to consider a motion to delay the vote. The controversy surrounds Bove's alleged unethical conduct, including a whistleblower's claim that Bove suggested defying court orders. Democrats cited these allegations as disqualifying, while Republicans defended Bove and accused their counterparts of partisan attacks.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties set aside political divisions to play in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, a charity event benefiting the Young Survival Coalition. The organization supports young adults diagnosed with breast cancer, a cause deeply personal to many participants, including co-founder Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a survivor herself. Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, the women's event features a single unified team of lawmakers competing against a team of female journalists known as the "Bad News Babes." The game, now in its 17th year, has successfully raised nearly $5 million for the cause, providing a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal report, citing reviewed documents, claims a 'bawdy' letter with Donald Trump's signature was sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. The letter allegedly featured a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman with Trump's signature located below her waist, mimicking pubic hair, and concluded with the line, 'may every day be another wonderful secret.' Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter or creating the drawing, calling the story a 'fake' and threatening to sue.

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK, where it will be melted to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the sample contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold clues about temperature, wind patterns, and atmospheric composition from a previously unknown period. Scientists hope the analysis will provide crucial data on the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, a mysterious period when Earth's glacial cycles changed dramatically. This research could revolutionize understanding of natural climate shifts and help predict future responses to human-caused warming.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food costs, decreased to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The drop was partly attributed to an easing in rice price inflation after the government released stockpiles, though overall inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This data arrives as the nation faces economic growth concerns due to potential U.S. tariffs and cost-of-living issues. While persistent inflation could support an interest rate hike, some analysts believe the central bank will wait until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom, set to take effect next July, will require 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) providers to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit and protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt. As a result, some shoppers may be denied this form of credit, and the process will include clearer information on fees, cancellation rights, and the potential impact on credit ratings.

          <p>This BBC analysis explains the political context behind the Labour Party's decision to suspend MP Diane Abbott for a second time. The core issue stems from Abbott's recent interview where she stated she did not regret her 2023 comments that appeared to downplay antisemitism by comparing it to prejudice against redheads. Because those initial remarks led to her first suspension, her refusal to express regret left the party leadership with limited options if it wished to maintain a consistent and firm stance against antisemitism. This position is particularly crucial for leader Keir Starmer, who has made eradicating the "poison" of antisemitism a central tenet of his leadership.</p>

The cattle population is at its lowest since 1951 due to factors including persistent drought, which raises feed costs, and high cattle prices that incentivize ranchers to sell rather than breed. The supply is further constrained by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a flesh-eating pest and the potential impact of widespread tariffs on imported beef. With strong consumer demand during grilling season, experts do not expect significant price relief in the near future.</p>

          <p>Abbott Laboratories CEO Robert Ford described the more than 8% drop in his company's stock as an "overreaction" from Wall Street. The decline followed a quarterly report where Abbott beat earnings expectations but tightened its full-year guidance, disappointing investors. In an interview, Ford attributed the revised outlook primarily to a weaker-than-expected performance in its diagnostics business in China, while emphasizing that the segment saw growth in all other global markets. He highlighted fundamental strengths elsewhere, including double-digit growth in the medical devices division and strong performance in generic pharmaceuticals in emerging markets.

          <p>President Trump is continuing to resist bipartisan calls to release the complete Justice Department file on Jeffrey Epstein, a stance that has created a difficult political situation for his administration. The issue gained prominence after the Attorney General mentioned an Epstein client list, a statement later retracted, sparking widespread interest, including from Trump's own supporters. The president has dismissed the controversy as a hoax and suggested only "credible" material be released. This resistance has fueled speculation and allowed Democrats to pressure Republicans, who appear to be protecting Epstein's co-conspirators by not supporting a full release of the documents.</p>

Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding its future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade.

Hankison was acquitted of state charges but found guilty in federal court for blindly firing ten shots into Taylor's apartment. The sentencing memo, a significant reversal from the previous administration's stance, also asks that Hankison receive credit for time served, meaning he would face no additional jail time.

Democrats on the House Rules Committee are forcing votes on amendments that would compel the release of government files related to the deceased sex offender, stalling the procedural measure needed to advance the rescissions package. The controversy has divided Republicans and put them in a difficult position, as some of Trump's own base wants the files released.

          <p>This article provides a medical explanation of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the condition President Trump was recently diagnosed with. CVI is a common circulatory issue, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood return to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling and varicose veins. According to vascular surgeons, the condition is generally not serious and is often managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes. In more advanced cases, skin discoloration or ulcers can occur, but for most patients, the symptoms are mild and treatable.</p>

The system is intended to provide critical low-altitude defense for military installations and formations, addressing the growing threat of 'Trojan Horse' drone attacks.

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld a controversial congressional map, rejecting a challenge that argued it illegally diminished the voting power of Black residents. The legal battle focused on Governor Ron DeSantis's dismantling of a north Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice. The court's majority, led by a DeSantis appointee, ruled that while the new map did reduce Black voters' influence, the plaintiffs failed to prove a compliant district could be drawn without making race the predominant factor. Critics and a dissenting justice warned the decision significantly weakens Florida's anti-gerrymandering protections.</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic examines the U.S. Supreme Court's increasing use of its emergency "shadow docket," particularly in cases involving the Trump administration. Unlike the regular docket, rulings on the shadow docket often come with little to no explanation, as seen in recent decisions allowing the dismantling of the Department of Education and the deportation of noncitizens to third countries. Legal experts express concern that the conservative supermajority is granting the administration significant victories and allowing major policies to take effect before their underlying legality is fully litigated. This trend raises questions about the Court's transparency and potential for politicization.</p>
