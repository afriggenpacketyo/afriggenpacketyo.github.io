          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has briefed Chinese President Xi Jinping on his communications with the Trump administration regarding a planned summit. According to the Chinese official statement, Xi expressed support for the U.S.-Russia dialogue and hopes for progress in resolving the Ukraine crisis. However, officials cited in the article remain skeptical that the meeting will produce a lasting peace agreement or significantly alter the broader strategic situation in Ukraine. The conversation underscores the ongoing coordination between Moscow and Beijing on major geopolitical developments.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition re-examines the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of Europe's most celebrated flower painters, even more famous than Rembrandt in her lifetime. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned embalmer and anatomist, Ruysch's environment was filled with preserved natural specimens, which likely influenced her detailed still-life paintings. The article details her professional success, including becoming a court painter and winning the lottery, while also navigating the challenges faced by female artists of her era. Her work is noted for its technical perfection, scientific accuracy, and complex compositions that blended beauty with the darker aspects of nature.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially signed striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. The 22-year-old Slovenia international has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major offensive signing of the season. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, chose to join Manchester United despite their lower Premier League finish last season. Head coach Ruben Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox praised his combination of pace, physical dominance, and strong character as essential additions to the team.</p>

The event involved a single shooter who is also deceased, and no other civilians were harmed. While an official motive has not been confirmed, law enforcement sources have suggested a theory that the gunman believed he was sick due to a coronavirus vaccine. The CDC expressed that it was heartbroken by the attack, which prompted a large police response and a lockdown of the nearby Emory University campus.</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the implications of Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to address the war in Ukraine. Panelists noted that the summit marks a departure from the previous administration's policy of not negotiating about Ukraine without its presence at the table. This direct engagement between the U.S. and Russia places Ukrainian leaders in a difficult position, as they may face pressure to accept terms brokered without their direct involvement. The discussion also touched upon Trump's broader trade policies and their potential impact on the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported another eleven deaths due to malnutrition, bringing the total of such fatalities to 212, including 98 children. This comes as Israel announces a controversial plan to take full security control of Gaza City, setting a deadline of October 7, 2025, for its one million residents to evacuate south. The plan has drawn widespread condemnation from humanitarian agencies and world leaders, who fear it will exacerbate the already dire humanitarian crisis. Aid distribution remains severely challenged, with the UN citing ongoing impediments and continued violence near aid points.</p>

The goal is to establish a public company that will hold its proprietary WLFI tokens, according to a Bloomberg News report.

His comments reflect growing anxiety in Kyiv that a direct meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders could marginalize Ukrainian interests.

For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people weekly and has spurred activity in the mall's other businesses. Industry executives note that subdividing large, empty retail spaces for niche businesses, restaurants, and experiential destinations is driving a rebound in mall traffic.

The idea, which is currently speculative and not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that turning elements like mercury into gold could create a valuable revenue stream to offset the high costs of developing fusion energy. While scientists have previously created minuscule amounts of gold in labs at exorbitant costs, Marathon believes its method could be commercially viable alongside fusion power plants.

A recent state audit criticized the agency for understaffing and failing to take proper action, while a review of recent heat deaths found cases where few or no penalties were issued.

          <p>This article pays tribute to former CIA officer Sandra Grimes, who died on July 25 at the age of 79. In 1991, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants had been compromised in the mid-1980s. Her meticulous investigation into financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 and convicted of espionage, having been paid millions by the Soviet Union for information that led to the execution of numerous U.S. assets.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to spin off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. In a public letter, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which incorrectly views it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm believes separating the high-growth, high-margin DAT business would unlock significant value for shareholders by highlighting its strengths independently of the consumer broadband segment.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the economic policies of Donald Trump's second term effectively amount to a "degrowth" strategy that will lead to a smaller U.S. economy. The author points to tariffs that raise consumer prices, cuts to government subsidies for necessities like healthcare and education, and attacks on scientific research as actions that suppress consumption, production, and innovation. While Trump promises economic growth, the article contends his policies are creating shortages, weakening the labor market, and increasing the likelihood of stagflation, ultimately making Americans worse off.

A new state-owned enterprise has been established to oversee the construction, which will link the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan. This will create a nearly 2,000-kilometer artery across the Tibetan plateau. The railway is a key part of a larger plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer high-plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing connectivity and enabling diversified operations like tourism and real estate development.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece examines the complex and often brutal trade-offs required to feed a growing global population sustainably. It highlights that agriculture consumes nearly half the planet's habitable land, making land use a critical constraint. The author discusses new books arguing for "sustainable intensification," which favors highly efficient, industrial farming—including factory farms—to produce the most food on the least land, thereby preserving wild ecosystems. However, this approach creates a stark moral conflict, pitting environmental preservation against the immense suffering of animals in intensive confinement systems, a dilemma the author argues cannot be ignored.</p>

The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are known for their bright fireballs and long wakes.
