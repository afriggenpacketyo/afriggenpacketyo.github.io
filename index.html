          <p>Japan's parliament has passed a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The law targets companies producing over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding it must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus. This system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, although it may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly considering military action against Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension stems from differing views between Netanyahu and Trump on how to best prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, with Netanyahu favoring immediate action and Trump preferring negotiation backed by the threat of force. Israeli officials fear that Trump's eagerness for a deal may allow Iran to maintain its enrichment facilities, leading Israel to prepare for a potential strike without U.S. assistance, though the effectiveness of such an action is debated.</p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton's stellar performance, with 32 points, 15 assists, and 12 rebounds, led the Indiana Pacers to a 130-121 victory over the New York Knicks, giving them a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Haliburton's father, who was previously banned from attending games, was present to witness his son's exceptional game. The Pacers have not lost consecutive games since March, and history favors them as teams leading playoff series 3-1 typically advance. Jalen Brunson scored 31 points for the Knicks, but they couldn't overcome the Pacers' strong performance.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, with their unemployment rate nearing 6%, surpassing the national average. The report from Oxford Economics attributes this trend to a slowdown in hiring in previously high-demand sectors, particularly technology, leading to a mismatch between the supply of graduates and available jobs. Economic uncertainty and the potential impact of automation and AI are also contributing factors, suggesting that the situation may worsen for young graduates (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A judge in Argentina's trial of Diego Maradona's medical staff has stepped down after being accused of behaving like an "actress" due to her participation in a documentary about the case. Judge Julieta Makintach was one of three judges overseeing the trial of seven members of Maradona's medical team, who are charged with negligent homicide. The trial has been adjourned, and a decision on whether to order a new trial will be made on Thursday, following accusations of impartiality and improper conduct.</p>
