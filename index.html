            <p>Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggests that investors are losing confidence in the U.S. as a safe investment haven due to escalating trade tensions under President Trump. Rising Treasury yields and a weakening dollar, contrary to typical tariff-increase reactions, signal a shift in investor preferences. Kashkari notes that while there are stresses in the market, significant dislocations haven't occurred, and his focus remains on keeping inflation expectations anchored. He emphasizes that rates are unlikely to change until there's clarity on fiscal and trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Chinese Finance Ministry stated that at the current tariff level, there is no longer a market for U.S. goods imported into China. Despite the escalation, China reiterated its openness to negotiate with the U.S. on an equal footing.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. While the court upheld the lower court's order, it also instructed the judge to clarify the scope of the order, raising questions about the administration's willingness to comply. The ruling is a rebuke to the administration's policy of prioritizing the deportation of alleged gang members.</p>

            <p>As tariffs threaten to raise prices on new goods, particularly apparel, experts are divided on whether this will significantly boost the secondhand market. While some predict increased demand for affordable alternatives, others suggest that tighter economic times could reduce both new purchases and donations, limiting the supply of secondhand items.
