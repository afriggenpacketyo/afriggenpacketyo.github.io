          <p>Several German states are expanding their use of "Gotham," a powerful surveillance software from US firm Palantir, to analyze vast amounts of data for police investigations. Civil rights groups, like the Society for Civil Rights (GFF), are challenging this implementation, arguing it violates constitutional rights to privacy and informational self-determination by potentially ensnaring innocent individuals. Despite these legal challenges and public petitions, Germany's Interior Minister is considering the software for federal police, raising concerns about dependency on foreign technology and potential data access by the US. The debate highlights a significant conflict between enhancing security and protecting fundamental civil liberties in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to charges related to a major corruption scandal involving Singapore's former transport minister, Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping the minister cover up evidence after being accused of providing lavish gifts, including Formula 1 tickets and private jet travel, during official business dealings. The case has shocked Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for corruption and high salaries for public officials intended to prevent it. Ong, who is also battling cancer, faces potential jail time for his role in the affair.</p>

          <p>China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, experienced its first monthly sales decline of the year in July, signaling the impact of a fierce price war within the industry. While BYD's deliveries dipped, other major players like Li Auto and Nio also reported slumps, whereas competitors Xpeng, Xiaomi, and Leapmotor saw continued growth. The intense competition, driven by significant discounts, has prompted warnings from Beijing to curb excessive price cutting. This market volatility highlights the dynamic and challenging landscape for EV makers in China as they navigate shifting consumer demand and aggressive pricing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has pledged to actively support peaceful development in the Horn of Africa through regional initiatives, as stated by its special envoy, Xue Bing, at a conference in Uganda. Beijing's commitment includes providing military assistance, training, infrastructure development, and increased trade to the eight participating East African nations. The envoy emphasized cooperation in areas like counterterrorism and landmine removal, while stressing support for "African-led solutions" through established regional bodies. This move underscores China's deepening engagement and strategic interests across the African continent, focusing on security and economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK-China Transparency (UKCT) think tank suggests that Chinese students at British universities are being pressured by officials to monitor their classmates and suppress discussions on topics sensitive to Beijing. The report also highlights instances of academics being warned against covering subjects like Xinjiang or COVID-19's origins, and some facing harassment or visa denials. This alleged interference raises significant concerns about academic freedom and free speech, especially as a new UK law places greater responsibility on universities to protect these principles. The Chinese embassy has dismissed the report as "groundless," but the issue underscores growing tensions over foreign influence in UK higher education.</p>

          <p>In a personal commentary, journalist Rokhaya Diallo recounts her experiences with Islamophobia in France, where she and other prominent Muslims are often treated with suspicion and unfairly linked to extremism. She describes being publicly pressured to denounce terrorism and facing defamatory accusations of inciting violence for her criticism of Charlie Hebdo, which led to a lengthy legal battle. The article argues that a pattern of "smear tactics" is used to discredit any Muslim who speaks out against Islamophobia, citing examples involving footballer Karim Benzema and fashion influencer Léna Situations. Diallo concludes that this hostile climate portrays French Muslims as a perpetual "enemy within," regardless of their integration or social status.</p>

The concept involves fitting small, side-mounted rocket boosters to drones, allowing them to perform sudden, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. According to their research, published in a Chinese defense journal, digital simulations showed this technology could boost a drone's survival probability to nearly 90 percent.

          <p>A collaborative conservation mission between Cuban and British scientists is underway to save the world's most beautiful snails, the Polymita species, native to Eastern Cuba. These snails, known for their vibrant and elaborately patterned shells, are being pushed toward extinction by the illegal shell trade, as their beauty makes them highly desirable to collectors. Researchers at the University of Nottingham and the Universidad de Oriente are using genetic research and captive breeding programs to better understand and protect the six known species. The project aims to combat the threat posed by poaching while also unraveling the evolutionary mystery behind their extraordinary colors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for UK motorists who were mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commission payments. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while narrowing the scope for mass claims, affirmed that deals with excessively large, undisclosed commissions were unfair. The FCA banned these "discretionary commission arrangements" in 2021, as they incentivized dealers to charge customers higher interest rates. The proposed scheme, expected to launch next year, could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with millions of consumers potentially eligible for payouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a world-first public health initiative, sexual health clinics across the UK have begun offering a vaccine to combat record-high levels of gonorrhoea. The program will initially target those at highest risk, primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple partners or STIs. The 4CMenB vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is also 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea and is expected to prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade. Health officials hope the rollout will not only curb soaring infection rates but also slow the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of the disease.</p>

          <p>A BBC Africa Eye investigation has uncovered a network of women, known as "madams," who are involved in the sexual exploitation of children as young as 13 in the Kenyan transit town of Maai Mahiu. Undercover journalists posing as sex workers secretly filmed two women who admitted to arranging for underage girls to be prostituted to truck drivers and other clients. The investigation highlights the normalization of child sexual abuse in the key transport hub and the immense vulnerability of orphaned or runaway children. Despite the evidence being handed to Kenyan police, no arrests have been made, underscoring the challenges in prosecuting such crimes.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey asserts that many people are broke not because they earn too little, but because their income is consumed by debt payments. He points to credit card bills, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits that prevent individuals from building wealth. Ramsey advises that income is the most powerful tool for financial growth, but it is rendered useless when given away to lenders. He proposes a three-step plan to regain control: create a zero-based budget, aggressively pay down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and avoid financing purchases by paying with cash.

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume more than 3.7 miles into the sky.

According to Russia's emergencies ministry, the ash cloud spread eastward over the Pacific Ocean without affecting any populated areas. Volcanologists confirmed this is the first historically recorded eruption of the volcano, with its last known activity dating back hundreds of years.</p>

Greer stated he does not expect the rates to be negotiated down, framing them as fixed results of deals or the lack thereof.

The plan was initially rejected by the local council but has been taken over by the UK government, with senior ministers signaling approval.

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve their fertility, but the procedure comes with a hefty price tag and no guarantee of a future pregnancy. The all-in cost for a single cycle can average between $12,000 and $13,000, and many women undergo multiple cycles to improve their chances, with most paying out-of-pocket. Fertility experts caution that there is a significant drop-off at each stage, from thawing eggs to achieving a successful birth. While the technology offers women more reproductive options, the financial burden and uncertain success rates remain significant considerations for those pursuing it.</p>
