          <p>Severe weather struck Washington County, Kentucky, resulting in one death and multiple injuries, with significant damage reported throughout the area. Governor Andy Beshear indicated that the severity of the weather, potentially including a tornado, was unexpected and urged residents in Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky to remain alert due to the risk of further severe storms. The storms are expected to bring damaging winds, large hail, and possible tornadoes from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic region. This is a developing situation, and updates are expected as more information becomes available.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to revoke humanitarian parole for over 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, allowing the administration to proceed with deportations while litigation continues. This decision reverses a lower court ruling that temporarily blocked the policy change, which eliminates protections granted by the Biden administration. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, with Jackson criticizing the majority for disregarding the devastating impact on the lives of these migrants. The administration has also recently moved to end Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans and has faced criticism for accepting white South African refugees while restricting immigration from other countries.</p>

          <p>CBS News has launched a price tracker to monitor the changing costs of everyday household expenses, including food, gas, utilities, and housing, as consumers grapple with persistent cost-of-living pressures. The tracker uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index and average price data, focusing on goods and services that significantly impact household budgets or have experienced notable price changes since 2022. The tool allows users to explore price changes across various categories, offering insights into how inflation and other economic factors are affecting the cost of living. Despite tariff reversals, some prices may still increase due to other market forces (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating the recent tariff truce agreed upon earlier this month, signaling a potential escalation in trade tensions between the two countries. Trump stated that China had "totally violated its agreement," though he did not specify the exact nature of the violation. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer elaborated that China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed, such as restrictions on U.S. companies and the flow of rare earth materials. The US is closely monitoring China's compliance, and remains concerned with the progress (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn FÃ©in leader, has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages following a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 story alleging he sanctioned the murder of Denis Donaldson, a British agent. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams, who denies any involvement, stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable. The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder, while the BBC expressed disappointment, citing the implications for freedom of expression. The legal bill for the case is estimated to be between â‚¬3-5 million.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Jama Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from public drinking water in the U.S. would result in an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years, costing $9.8 billion. This represents a 7.5% increase in cavities, disproportionately affecting children on public health insurance or without insurance. The study contradicts claims made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who advocates for ending water fluoridation. The research indicates that while high levels of fluoride can be harmful, the levels used in water fluoridation are safe and effective in preventing tooth decay.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. would aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students connected to the ruling party or studying in critical fields. This time, Beijing's response has been more measured, with the Foreign Ministry denouncing the move as discriminatory and lodging diplomatic protests.

          <p>President Trump reacted sharply to the "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a phrase coined by a Financial Times columnist to criticize his tariff policies. The meme suggests that Trump frequently announces tariffs but then delays or reduces them, allowing investors to profit. When asked about the meme, Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and delay tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question "nasty." He argued that his actions helped China and denied that he was "chickening out."</p>

          <p>A higher education expert, Mark Kantrowitz, suggests that the House Republicans' proposed student loan changes, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could lead to "indentured servitude" due to a 30-year repayment timeline. The bill proposes only two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years. While supporters argue it ensures borrowers pay down their principal, critics are concerned about extending debt into middle age and beyond (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An opinion essay in the New York Times explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant to have children, citing factors such as financial concerns, career priorities, and climate change worries. The author suggests that a significant reason is the redefined understanding of harm, abuse, and trauma, leading to heightened expectations for parenting. This cultural shift has created an almost impossible standard for parents, who are now expected to ensure their children's career success and mental well-being well into adulthood. The article highlights the growing trend of adult children cutting off contact with parents over perceived emotional or relational struggles.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania following the finalization of a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel. The deal aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania and involves a $14 billion investment, potentially creating 70,000 jobs. Senator David McCormick stated that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. government holding a golden share. The United Steelworkers union has expressed concerns about the acquisition, citing potential risks to American jobs.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end a program that temporarily protected over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, while a legal battle over the decision proceeds. This action reverses a lower court order and allows the administration to terminate the humanitarian parole program, known as CHNV. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority for facilitating human suffering. The administration argues that the policy change is necessary to deter illegal entry and uphold democratically approved policies.</p>

This strategy marks a shift from previous practices, as officials had largely avoided arrests at immigration courts out of concern that they would deter people from showing up for hearings.

          <p>A new report indicates that piracy of premium video services, particularly live sports, is occurring at an "industrial scale" due to a lack of action by big tech firms. The report accuses Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia" regarding the issue, which costs broadcasters revenue and exposes users to cyber-crime risks. The Amazon Fire Stick is identified as a key enabler of piracy, providing access to both legitimate and illegal streaming services. The report also warns that users of illegal streams are at risk of malware and phishing scams.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including stripping its student-visa certification and demanding surveillance of protests, represent a broader threat to academic freedom. These actions, justified under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, lack due process and could set a precedent for government overreach into higher education. While Harvard has its own issues with free expression and intellectual diversity, the administration's unilateral actions risk undermining academic independence across the country. The author warns that these actions could extend to other institutions, chilling free speech and dissent on campuses nationwide.</p>
