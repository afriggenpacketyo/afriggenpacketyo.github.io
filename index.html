          <p>Warren Buffett announced his intention to recommend Greg Abel as his successor as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year during the annual shareholder meeting. Buffett, 94, stated that Abel's designation as CEO successor was decided in 2021, and he would still remain to assist. Buffett also clarified that keeping every share is an economic decision as he believes Berkshire will have better prospects under Abel's leadership. Abel, 62, currently serves as the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, but it is not yet confirmed whether he will also assume the role of chairman. Optimism that Abel can lead Berkshire Hathaway to future success is high.</p>

          <p>Residents of Oakdale, California, have largely abandoned traditional media outlets in favor of podcasters, online influencers, and Facebook groups for their news, leading to a fragmented and often unreliable information landscape. The New York Times article highlights how the decline of local newspapers and the rise of social media have transformed the town's media consumption habits, sometimes with negative consequences, including the spread of conspiracy theories and the rise of hyperpartisan groups. The situation culminated in an incident where an armed militia was drawn to the town by a false rumor spread on Facebook, prompting some residents to question the reliability and impact of their new sources of information. While some residents seek to find truth in a post-journalism world of Facebook groups and online influencers, many feel less informed than before.</p>

          <p>A New York Times guest essay by psychiatrist Awais Aftab addresses the complexities of antidepressant use, acknowledging their transformative potential for some patients while also highlighting the less-advertised side effects, such as sexual dysfunction and severe withdrawal symptoms. Aftab criticizes the lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians in safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to seek strategies in online communities. The article calls for a more nuanced public discourse about psychiatric medications, recognizing both their benefits and trade-offs, and urges the medical community to engage seriously with patients' concerns to maintain credibility. Aftab argues that neglecting the experiences of those whose lives have been negatively impacted by psychiatric medications risks ceding the conversation to those who may exploit their suffering for personal or political gain.</p>

The ministry emphasized that Germany has learned from its history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule until 2030 without democratic elections, proposing to dissolve the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limit the number of permitted parties. The move, endorsed by allies at a "national conference" boycotted by the opposition, aims to tighten conditions for founding new parties and end "political nomadism." Amnesty International has condemned the proposal as a flagrant attack on freedom of expression and association. Opposition parties fear the junta will strengthen its crackdown on political dissent, undermining the hard-won democracy.</p>

          <p>Two commercial jetliners had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter violating safety standards, according to U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. The FAA said the helicopter took a scenic route around the Pentagon instead of proceeding directly to the heliport. The incident occurred three months after a mid-air collision near the airport between a Black Hawk and a passenger jet that killed 67 people. Duffy has called the incident unacceptable and plans to discuss the matter with the Defense Department.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which could significantly increase the prices of new and used vehicles, as well as repair costs and insurance premiums. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump, aim to promote domestic manufacturing. The tariffs will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. Experts anticipate that the tariffs will lead to higher car prices, contributing to overall inflation, and may drive some suppliers out of business due to financial stress.</p>
