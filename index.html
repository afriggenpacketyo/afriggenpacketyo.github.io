          <p>Labour MPs are reportedly despondent following a chaotic week that included Lord Mandelson's dismissal and Angela Rayner's resignation, creating significant internal party turmoil. Mandelson was removed as UK ambassador to the US after emails linking him to Jeffrey Epstein surfaced, raising serious questions about the vetting procedures and the Prime Minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. This political fallout has led to urgent calls for leadership to address the party's stability and restore public trust, with some questioning McSweeney's continued role. Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties are now demanding the release of documents related to Mandelson's appointment, further intensifying the political pressure.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. will split profits with Japan from American-based projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment, part of a recent tariff deal. Profits will be shared equally until Japan recoups its initial investment, after which the U.S. will receive 90% and Japan 10%. This initiative aims to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, facilitating job creation and economic growth. Lutnick emphasized the deal's mutual benefits, providing Japan with lower tariffs and the U.S. with substantial capital, though some of Trump's tariffs remain in legal dispute.

As the founder of the Invictus Games, he emphasized aiding the recovery process for veterans, with Ukraine bidding to host the event in 2029. His Archewell foundation recently donated $500,000 for projects supporting injured children in Gaza and Ukraine. This visit, which included meeting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, also coincides with new UK sanctions against Russia and follows a recent meeting with King Charles III, hinting at potential royal reconciliation amidst ongoing conflict escalation.</p>

          <p>A relative of a 9/11 firefighter, Mike Weinstein, publicly criticized New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani during an anniversary ceremony for his reluctance to condemn the slogan "globalize the intifada." Weinstein warned that refusing to denounce such phrases invites future terror, urging all politicians to firmly renounce violence and unite against terror. Mamdani, who initially suggested the phrase expressed a desperate desire for Palestinian human rights, later clarified he would "discourage" the language after discussions with Jewish leaders, acknowledging its harmful impact on many Jewish New Yorkers. This incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding political rhetoric and its perceived implications for public safety and community relations.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of South Korean workers, detained in a large-scale U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai battery factory in Georgia, have returned home to Incheon after intense diplomatic negotiations. The detention of 475 individuals, who were reportedly handcuffed and shackled, sparked outrage in South Korea and threatened crucial economic ties between the two allies. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the workers had incorrect visas, prompting discussions for a new visa type for Korean specialist workers to address long-standing issues. The incident has delayed the Hyundai plant's startup and raised concerns about future South Korean investment in America, highlighting challenges in international labor mobility and trade relations.</p>

In response, Chelsea has recalled striker Marc Guiu from a loan spell to provide immediate cover, especially following Nicolas Jackson's transfer to Bayern Munich.

This decision follows accusations last year that Microsoft breached competition rules through the "abusive" bundling of its products, stemming from a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack. Under the binding agreement, valid for at least seven years, Microsoft will offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, ensure interoperability with rival tools, and facilitate data migration.

The Office for National Statistics now emphasizes a rolling three-month growth period, which stood at a modest 0.2%. This economic stagnation intensifies pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget, as the government struggles to boost growth and meet its fiscal rules amid warnings of further slowdown in the latter half of the year.

This finding challenges the previous focus on direct human impact like habitat loss and pesticides, suggesting climate change permeates even pristine environments.

However, former FDA officials and academics contend that advisory committees are crucial for decision-making, public understanding, and independent expert input.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper secured its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its race to catch up with SpaceX's dominant Starlink satellite internet constellation. While Kuiper currently has only 102 satellites compared to Starlink's thousands, Amazon plans to deploy 3,236 by 2029, with major launches scheduled via Blue Origin and other providers. The burgeoning Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite market, projected to launch 70,000 satellites by 2031, aims to provide internet access to billions globally, particularly in remote or underserved regions. This intensifying competition is expected to drive innovation and expand connectivity worldwide, benefiting a vast underserved population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed a new fleet of advanced specialized island-landing vessels, confirmed by hull numbers 401 to 403 spotted on three "Dong Gong" series barges docked in mainland China. These markings indicate their service in the PLA’s Eastern Theatre Command, focusing on the East Sea Fleet, according to a former Chinese military instructor. Drone footage reveals the barges are equipped with multiple extendable legs designed to lift the craft clear of the water and stabilize it firmly during landing operations. This deployment signifies a notable enhancement in the Chinese navy's engineering and amphibious capabilities, potentially for regional strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>UFC chief Dana White had a fiery exchange with a reporter during the press conference for the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford super-fight, momentarily overshadowing the main event. White, promoting his new Saudi Arabian-backed boxing venture, grew agitated when questioned about the Muhammad Ali Act, a law designed to protect boxers' rights and combat monopolies. Critics argue White's UFC model in boxing could restrict fighters with exclusive contracts and reduce their revenue share. The high-profile bout, broadcast globally on Netflix, signals a new, albeit uncertain, era for boxing, highlighting ongoing debates about fighter rights and industry control amidst significant financial stakes.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis, featuring a range of international law experts, largely concludes that Israel's military actions in Gaza, which have killed tens of thousands and destroyed vast infrastructure, are not proportionate under international law. While Israel asserts its inherent right to self-defense against Hamas, experts cite the immense scale of civilian casualties, aid blockades leading to famine, and widespread destruction as evidence of disproportionality. The debate further extends to whether Israel's right to self-defense applies against a population it maintains under occupation and if its stated goals extend beyond merely incapacitating Hamas. These assessments are unfolding amidst International Criminal Court arrest warrants and ongoing International Court of Justice proceedings, highlighting profound international legal and humanitarian concerns.</p>

The disaster devastates a population where 40% live below the poverty line, with many families initially reluctant to leave their homes, leading to tragic rescue boat capsizes. The UN has allocated $5 million and the U.S. deployed response personnel, while Pakistan declared a climate emergency and ordered a 300-day climate action plan to address future challenges.</p>

          <p>The cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years to £3.1 billion annually, yet a National Audit Office report concludes it fails to provide value for money and often delivers poor care.

The report highlights instances of substandard conditions, like broken glass in showers, and frequent distant relocations for children, disrupting their education and well-being.
