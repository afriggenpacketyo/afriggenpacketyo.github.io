          <p>India's central bank exceeded market predictions by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking the third consecutive rate cut since February. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, reflecting a slowdown from the previous year. While the RBI acknowledges limited room for monetary policy to further support growth, it shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative" and will carefully assess incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>The UK government has banned six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives if they fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have criminal convictions. This measure, part of the strengthened Water Act, addresses public outrage over sewage spills and rising bills despite substantial executive rewards. The ban, effective retroactively from April 2024, applies to Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water, with regulator Ofwat empowered to reclaim bonuses or take enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the end of profiting from pollution, while acknowledging the need for water firms to rebuild trust with customers. </p>

However, tensions arose as Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to Musk's departure from the White House and a subsequent exchange of insults on social media.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's overcapacity in manufacturing, driven by weak domestic demand and export tariffs, is creating a 'China shock' for global markets, leading to concerns about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., the production overdrive is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory. Despite these concerns, economists note that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could alleviate inflationary pressures for inflation-burdened economies, potentially prompting central banks in Asia to consider further rate cuts. Nomura predicts additional rate cuts from central banks across Asia, including India, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea. (not investment advice)</p>

State media reported the ship's balance was restored in early June, and it was safely moored at the pier. Leader Kim Jong Un, who witnessed the failed launch, deemed it a 'criminal act' and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party.

          <p>Israeli forces conducted airstrikes on a southern suburb of Beirut on the eve of Eid Al Adha, targeting what they claimed was a Hezbollah unit producing drones. The attack occurred despite a ceasefire that had been in effect for the past six months, prompting evacuation warnings for several buildings in the area. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the strikes as a violation of international accord, while the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon emphasized the importance of diplomacy. Israel's Defense Minister praised the military's execution of the strikes, holding the Lebanese government responsible for preventing violations of the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace Inc. failed in its attempt to become the first private firm in Asia to land on the Moon, as its lunar lander likely crashed during its descent. The lander, Resilience, began descending from an altitude of around 100 kilometers but was unable to decelerate to the required speed, leading to a presumed hard landing. CEO Takeshi Hakamada apologized to supporters and stated the company will analyze the cause of the failure and attempt another landing in 2027 with a new lander. This marks the company's second unsuccessful attempt to reach the Moon, following a similar incident in April 2023.</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact, finding that AI makes workers 'more valuable, not less,' and that jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The report, analyzing over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, found that productivity growth in industries positioned to adopt AI has nearly quadrupled since 2022. Wages for workers with AI skills are 56% higher, and employer demand for formal degrees is declining in AI-exposed jobs. The report suggests that AI can enrich automatable jobs, freeing up employees for more complex tasks, and that softening job growth in AI-exposed occupations could benefit countries with declining working-age populations.

Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The data suggests an increasing trend of cases collapsing due to lost or missing evidence, attributed to resourcing issues and cuts to police forces. A criminologist believes the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 contributed to the problem, with police forces now responsible for their own evidence storage arrangements.</p>

          <p>A new Ipsos poll reveals that people across Europe believe their countries are in decline and society is broken, with negative sentiment growing in major economies like Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy. Economic concerns appear to be fueling populist sentiment, with a majority of respondents believing their economies are rigged to advantage the rich and powerful. British citizens were the most likely to support a "strong leader who breaks the rules" as a solution to their problems, indicating a high level of dissatisfaction with the status quo.
