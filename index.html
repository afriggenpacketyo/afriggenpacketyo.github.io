          <p>The Co-op Group has revealed that a significant cyberattack earlier this year resulted in at least £206 million in lost revenue. The security breach, which occurred in April, compromised the retailer's IT networks, leading to payment system failures, product shortages in stores, and the loss of customer data. This disruption pushed the company to a £75 million underlying pre-tax loss for the first half of the year, a stark contrast to the £3 million profit from the same period last year. The full financial impact may still grow, as the company anticipates further consequences in the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has stated that some Labour MPs have privately encouraged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. While not currently an MP, Burnham did not dismiss the possibility of a future leadership bid, highlighting his two previous campaigns for the role. His comments emerge ahead of the Labour conference and follow a period of pressure on Starmer's leadership. Burnham suggested a series of policy changes, including tax adjustments and housing investment, which he believes would help address the nation's challenges and counter the threat from the Reform UK party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a cyberattack forced the automaker to halt production. The attack has left JLR's factories idle until at least October, raising concerns that smaller suppliers heavily reliant on the company could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms. The disruption is reportedly costing JLR £50 million per week and has affected tens of thousands of jobs in the supply chain.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's recent £18.1 million acquisition, goalkeeper Senne Lammens, has yet to make his debut, leaving fans and analysts to speculate when he will get his chance. The 23-year-old Belgian has reportedly impressed in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals since his transfer from Royal Antwerp. However, head coach Ruben Amorim has so far opted for the more experienced Altay Bayindir, citing the need for a gradual transition for Lammens into a new league.

          <p>Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch, once a struggling talent at Bayern Munich, has transformed into one of Europe's elite midfielders under the guidance of manager Arne Slot. After a quiet first season, Slot repositioned Gravenberch into a holding midfield role, where he has become a standout performer, driving Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table. His defensive contributions have remained consistent, but he has been granted more attacking freedom, resulting in a significant increase in shots and chances created. Analysts now compare him favorably to other top midfielders, crediting Slot's trust and tactical adjustments for unlocking his full potential.</p>

          <h2>White House Signals Potential for Permanent Layoffs in Case of Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 23:28:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated that if a government shutdown occurs on October 1, it may pursue permanent layoffs rather than temporary furloughs for some federal workers. An Office of Management and Budget memo suggests using the funding lapse as an opportunity to implement a "reduction in force" for employees in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This marks a significant departure from past shutdowns and is seen as an aggressive tactic by budget director Russell Vought to cut government programs. The move adds pressure to budget negotiations, as Democrats have called the threat an attempt at intimidation.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of a "triple sabotage" during his recent visit to the United Nations and is demanding an immediate investigation. In a social media post, he cited three incidents: an escalator he was on abruptly stopping, a teleprompter malfunctioning during his speech, and a faulty audio system in the main auditorium. Trump asserted these events were not coincidental and called for those responsible to be held accountable. UN officials have offered explanations, suggesting a videographer may have accidentally triggered the escalator's safety stop and that the teleprompter was operated by the U.S. delegation.</p>

Currently, there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, but the storm's path could bring downstream impacts to parts of the U.S. Southeast coast. Forecasters are also monitoring a second weather system in the Caribbean that has the potential to develop into a tropical depression later this week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched new national security investigations into a wide range of imports, including robotics, industrial machinery, and critical medical devices like masks and syringes. These "Section 232" probes will assess whether reliance on foreign supply chains for these goods poses a threat to U.S. security, potentially paving the way for fresh tariffs. The move could significantly raise costs for consumers, hospitals, and manufacturers, particularly the auto industry, which is a major importer of industrial robots. The investigations reflect growing concerns in Washington over supply chain vulnerabilities for goods deemed essential to the nation.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are close to deciding whether to seek a criminal indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, according to multiple sources. While the specific charges are unclear, the investigation has reportedly focused on whether Comey lied to Congress in 2020 about the origins of the FBI's probe into Russian election interference. The potential indictment comes amid intense pressure from President Trump, who recently fired the interim U.S. Attorney in Virginia for reportedly refusing to press charges. The five-year statute of limitations for the alleged crime is set to expire shortly, adding urgency to the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with federal immigration agents to receive certain FEMA grants. The decision is a setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit their assistance with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed by 20 states, which argued that tying critical emergency preparedness funding to immigration policy was unlawful. U.S. District Judge William Smith sided with the states, calling the policy "arbitrary and capricious" and noting the irreparable harm that could result from the loss of disaster relief funds.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of Canada has issued a temporary stay on an order to cull nearly 400 ostriches at a farm in British Columbia, following an avian flu outbreak. The farm's owners have been fighting the order from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which argues the cull is necessary to prevent the virus from persisting and potentially mutating. The case has gained international attention, and the court's decision will pause the execution of the birds while it decides whether to hear the owners' full appeal. In the interim, the CFIA will maintain custody of the ostriches on the farm property.</p>

While the investment provides OpenAI with capital for operations, the majority of the funds are earmarked for accessing the graphics processing units (GPUs) essential for training and running its AI models.

          <p>Africa imported a record amount of Chinese-made solar panels in the first seven months of the year, signaling a rapid expansion of solar energy capacity across the continent. A study by Oxford Economics revealed that imports reached 9,516 megawatts, a significant increase from 6,625 megawatts during the same period last year. This growth is driven by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria. The trend highlights China's dominant role in the global solar industry and its increasing influence on Africa's energy infrastructure development.</p>

The initiative pays farmers to undertake the restoration, which helps filter water, store carbon, and provide storm resilience, while also creating public recreational space. For many multi-generational farmers, the program offers a way to preserve their land ecologically as they face economic headwinds and approach retirement. Over the past 15 years, the state has successfully restored over 500 acres, with plans to restore another 500.</p>
