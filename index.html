          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, surged to a record high, driven by positive economic news and trade optimism. The rally was fueled by the International Monetary Fund's decision to upgrade the country's 2025 growth forecast, citing the private sector's agility in managing supply chains. Additionally, comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary suggesting that trade negotiations with South Korea were nearing completion provided a significant boost to investor confidence. Major companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor saw substantial gains, reflecting the overall positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released its final report, concluding that the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible was caused by faulty engineering. The report highlights that the carbon fiber hull failed to meet necessary strength requirements, and operator OceanGate did not adequately test the vessel. Furthermore, the NTSB found that OceanGate's flawed data analysis prevented the company from realizing the submersible was already damaged from a previous dive and needed to be removed from service. The incident resulted in the deaths of all five passengers aboard the expedition to the Titanic wreckage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations within Venezuela. He cited two primary reasons for the authorization: to counter the flow of drugs from the country and in response to his unsubstantiated claim that Venezuela is intentionally sending prisoners and institutionalized individuals to the U.S. The Venezuelan government condemned the move as "warmongering" and an attempt at regime change. This confirmation follows a series of U.S. military strikes against suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local public school district. The funds were required for a bond ordered by a federal judge to cover the district's potential legal fees. The case centers on two male students who were suspended for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender classmate, a biological female, using the boys' locker room. The parents are challenging the suspensions and the school's locker room policy, with the case gaining national attention and support from conservative legal groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. Trump stated that this move is crucial for pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine, adding that the halt would involve "a little bit of a process." India is currently one of the largest buyers of Russian crude oil, a point of contention in its relationship with Washington. New Delhi has previously defended its purchases as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted the man accused of starting the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, which resulted in 12 deaths. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, now faces three federal charges, including destruction of property by fire and arson, with a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years. Prosecutors allege that Rinderknecht, working as an Uber driver, ignited a brush fire that smoldered for nearly a week before high winds reignited it into one of the most destructive wildfires in the city's history. Authorities have not yet specified a motive for the alleged arson.</p>

          <p>A new Trump administration policy requiring a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa application is already disrupting hiring for skilled workers, particularly at small businesses and venture-backed startups. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the steep cost is slowing the hiring process and shrinking the available talent pool for specialized roles, especially in fields like artificial intelligence. While the policy aims to prioritize American workers, it creates a significant financial hurdle for smaller companies unable to compete with large corporations for top international talent.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals for making incendiary social media comments following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individuals, from six different countries, reportedly posted messages suggesting Kirk deserved to be killed. This action is part of a broader crackdown on comments celebrating Kirk's death, with the administration vowing to take action against any visa holders who praise the killing. The move raises legal questions about the government's power to deny or revoke visas based on speech, particularly for individuals already in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a plan to help the government close costly asylum hotels by moving asylum seekers into social housing. The proposal suggests the government provide funds to councils and housing associations to purchase more properties, which would be added to the nation's social housing stock. This would create new homes for existing tenants, and the vacated properties could then house asylum seekers at a fraction of the cost of hotels. The plan aims to provide a more sustainable and integrated solution while also increasing the overall availability of affordable housing.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is imperative and on its way, regardless of opposition from major tech companies. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, Blackburn noted that states like California and Texas have already begun implementing their own safeguards because Congress has not yet acted. She emphasized the need for a federal consumer privacy protection bill to give individuals control over their data before it is used to train AI models. Blackburn also highlighted growing concerns from parents about the impact of AI chatbots on children's mental health.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson is facing a major lawsuit in the UK involving 3,000 claimants who allege the company knowingly sold baby powder contaminated with asbestos. The legal claim, which could become one of the largest product liability cases in British history, cites internal documents suggesting J&J was aware of asbestos-like fibers in its talc as early as the 1960s. The lawsuit accuses the company of concealing the cancer risks while marketing the product as safe. J&J denies the allegations, stating its baby powder was compliant with all regulations and does not cause cancer.</p>

This focus on sustainability has provided long-term economic benefits, with the average cost of electricity remaining remarkably stable over the past decade.

Analysts expect Beijing to double down on its strategy of promoting domestic demand and increasing support for homegrown high-tech industries like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. The resulting "15th five-year plan" will be crucial for China's long-term ambition to achieve major breakthroughs in core technologies and boost its economic standing by 2035.</p>
