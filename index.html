            <p>A recent report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China's 'Made in China 2025' plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology, has missed several key targets, despite significant investment. While China has exceeded expectations in the automotive sector, it has not yet reached its goals in areas like aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan, which was met with international criticism for promoting Chinese business at the expense of foreign companies, has also contributed to overcapacity and unhealthy competition within China, raising global security concerns as the country moves up the manufacturing value chain. Despite these shortcomings, China has still managed to transform itself into a major manufacturing power, driving 29% of global manufacturing value add. </p>

            <p>New research suggests that the brown rat's domestication may be traced back to China's Ming Dynasty, with ancient silk paintings providing the earliest evidence of such domestication. The study posits that domesticated brown rats could have spread globally via ships used by admiral Zheng He's Treasure Fleet during the Ming Dynasty. These expeditions, involving tens of thousands of men and hundreds of ships, may have inadvertently transported the rats worldwide. Brown rats, originating in northern China and Mongolia, have become widespread, with domesticated forms including fancy rats and laboratory rats used extensively in biological research.</p>

            <p>This article discusses whether a 50-year-old with $650,000 in a 401(k) should switch to Roth contributions, emphasizing that the decision depends on individual financial goals and circumstances. Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but require paying taxes upfront, while traditional 401(k)s provide tax deductions on contributions but tax withdrawals in retirement. The article explores scenarios where Roth contributions might be beneficial, such as diversifying income streams or bolstering estate planning, and advises consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance. It highlights the trade-offs between upfront tax costs and long-term tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's announcement of a state visit to the UK, dubbed a "fest", has sparked debate about its timing and potential impact on strained relations. The visit, offered by King Charles, aims to strengthen ties despite Trump's controversial policies and strained relationships with allies. The UK government hopes to leverage British soft power and Trump's fondness for the Royal Family to influence him on key issues like Ukraine and trade. The visit poses a risk, given Trump's divisive nature and unpredictable actions.</p>

The lack of a clear international response to these actions is concerning, with potential explanations including fear, complacency, or a lack of options.</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a funding shortfall after the government failed to provide the same level of compensation for tax increases as the police. While police forces received full compensation for the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions, fire services will only receive top-up funds covering 50% of the increase. This shortfall could impact fire service budgets and potentially affect their ability to keep communities safe, according to the National Fire Chiefs Council.</p>
