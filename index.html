          <p>Max Verstappen clinched victory at the Japanese Grand Prix, leading throughout the race despite pressure from McLarens' Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Norris initially complained about Verstappen's aggressive driving, but stewards sided with Verstappen. While Norris and Piastri maintained close proximity, they couldn't surpass Verstappen, with Piastri even suggesting he had the pace to win. Ultimately, Verstappen secured the win, expressing happiness with the car's improved performance, while Norris acknowledged McLaren's need for further improvements to challenge Red Bull. The race was largely static, with Leclerc holding off Russell for fourth.</p>

          <p>The search for Jodi Huisentruit, an Iowa news anchor who disappeared in 1995, continues as a private investigator fights to unseal case records. A judge partially unsealed a 2017 search warrant but kept the supporting affidavit sealed to protect the ongoing investigation. The investigator seeks records related to GPS tracking devices on vehicles linked to a person of interest, John Vansice, who has never been charged. Huisentruit's family opposes unsealing the documents, fearing it could hinder the investigation. She vanished on her way to work, with her car and signs of a struggle found at her apartment.</p>

          <p>Livia Tossici-Bolt, an anti-abortion campaigner, was found guilty of breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order for protesting outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, UK. The court found that her actions distressed women seeking medical treatment, and she was ordered to pay significant costs. Tossici-Bolt's case has drawn support from US anti-abortion groups and politicians, including JD Vance, who frame the issue as a free speech crisis. However, critics argue that the buffer zones are necessary to protect women from harassment and intimidation when accessing reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel, sparking criticism from Foreign Secretary David Lammy who deemed the action "unacceptable." Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to "spread hate speech," a charge the MPs refuted, stating their intention was to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand. The MPs, both elected in 2024, have been vocal about the Israel-Hamas conflict in Parliament, with Mohamed initiating a letter calling for a ban on goods from Israeli settlements. The UK Foreign Office has offered support to the MPs.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of catastrophic earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, published just days before a devastating earthquake struck Myanmar. The research links seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation, analyzing 150 years of seismic data to identify major earthquake "active periods." The timing of the research has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The study suggests the recent earthquake in Myanmar may not be an isolated incident.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Underdogs," explores the complexities of the white working class in Britain, arguing that their distinctiveness is more geographic than ethnic. White workers disproportionately reside outside metropolitan areas with limited social mobility and opportunities. The book challenges myths about immigration attitudes, finding age to be a more significant predictor than class. The author questions Labour's shift away from working-class politics, suggesting it has left some feeling abandoned, creating space for parties like Reform to exploit their concerns.</p>

It advocates for reciprocal sanctions on selected US service exports and a joint approach to challenging US monopoly digital platforms.

          <p>Esther Ghey, mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, has criticized the government's approach to online safety, citing her frustration that "young people are losing their lives." Ghey's child was murdered by two 15-year-olds, one of whom had been watching violent content online. Ghey expressed concern over reports that the Online Safety Bill could be weakened to secure trade deals with the US, describing the suggestion as "shocking."

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza on March 23. While the IDF claims some medics were linked to Hamas, they admit the medics were unarmed when soldiers opened fire. Mobile phone footage from one of the paramedics contradicted Israel's initial claims that the vehicles approached without lights. The IDF says soldiers assumed they were under threat when the ambulances stopped near a car containing Hamas members.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban warns that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs, combined with cuts to federal workforce, could lead to a long-term economic harm "far worse" than the 2008 financial crisis. Cuban argues that if tariffs stay in place for multiple years and are inflationary, combined with workforce cuts, the country will face a severe economic situation. He suggests the policies could have a detrimental effect on the nation's economic health. Cuban did not expand on why he sees the sweeping cuts to the federal workforce led by the DOGE office as related to the nation's economic health.</p>
