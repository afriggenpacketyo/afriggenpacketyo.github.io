          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled, necessitating direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping to resolve complexities. Despite a recent breakthrough agreement in Switzerland where tariff increases were rolled back for 90 days, disagreements persist over tech restrictions on Beijing and China's rare earth policies. Bessent expressed confidence that China would come to the table once President Trump makes his preferences known, highlighting the importance of the leaders' relationship in navigating these intricate discussions. The article emphasizes that the magnitude and complexity of the trade talks require high-level intervention to move forward. (not investment advice)</p>

Laatsch allegedly transcribed classified information at his desk and hid it in his socks, planning to deliver it via thumb drive to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign emissary.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. The appeals court granted a bid from the White House to keep the tariffs in place while the case is further litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president's authority and threatened trade negotiations. The initial ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade had voided tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as a blanket 10% import tax on goods from other countries.

          <p>Elon Musk's four-month tenure at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) has concluded, marked by significant spending cuts and considerable controversy. Musk aimed to slash government spending, initially targeting $2 trillion, later shifting to $150 billion, and claiming savings of $175 billion through various measures. However, a BBC analysis found some of these figures lacked evidence, and mass firings led to legal challenges and backtracks, raising ethical questions about conflicts of interest due to Musk's companies' government contracts. The Doge-led cuts also significantly reduced USAID programs, impacting international aid and raising concerns about U.S. influence on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, involving the placement of 5,900 tons of boulders and 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is also constructing a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail, with the total project cost estimated at $300 million. The OCTA acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs in San Clemente.</p>

Key challenges included training the AI with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system does not leak tech secrets, and convincing skeptical nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods.
