          <p>Two individuals were killed in a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip following a dispute that originated on social media. Police responded to reports of gunshots near the Bellagio Hotel & Casino and discovered the victims with gunshot wounds, both of whom were pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities believe the incident was targeted and isolated, with the suspect identified but not yet apprehended. The investigation is ongoing, but police have indicated that there is no broader threat to the public. Optimism is not high in light of the loss of life and the circumstances surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>An NHS trust and a ward manager have been convicted of health and safety failings related to the suicide of a 22-year-old woman, Alice Figueiredo, who was under their care at Goodmayes Hospital. Alice had a history of suicide attempts, and the jury found that the North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) and ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa did not adequately prevent her from taking her own life. The trust was acquitted of corporate manslaughter, and Aninakwa was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter, however, the family of Alice had been seeking answers about what happened for nearly a decade. The case highlights concerns about mental health care and the need for transparency in addressing failings.</p>

          <p>More than 70 countries are expected to advocate for international targets to reduce plastic production and consumption in a joint statement at the U.N. Ocean Conference. The aim is to combat marine pollution, with concerns growing over microplastics impacting marine organisms and potentially human health. Japan is not expected to support the statement, citing a desire for an agreement that includes as many countries as possible, while petroleum-producing Middle Eastern countries are also likely to abstain. Negotiations on an international treaty will continue in Switzerland, but reaching a consensus on manufacturing regulations remains challenging.</p>

Both countries have accused each other of breaching a temporary truce established last month, increasing pressure to reach a comprehensive trade deal.

          <p>The Trump administration has been criticized for its increasingly antagonistic stance towards transgender people, with policies and statements that portray them as inherently deluded or dishonorable. Executive orders, such as the one prohibiting trans people from serving in the military, use language that suggests a conflict between gender identity and an honorable lifestyle. This shift marks a departure from Trump's initial campaign, where he appeared more tolerant. Critics argue that these actions reflect a broader effort to wage a polarized fight against a vilified enemy, rather than broker sensitive compromises.</p>

          <p>Mark Gordon, on trial with his partner Constance Marten over the death of their newborn baby, has described the prosecution's case as "like a script from a movie." Gordon and Marten deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child. The prosecution alleges that their baby died of hypothermia after they negligently took her camping in January 2023. Gordon, representing himself after his lawyers withdrew, argued that the prosecution had "just made things up" to support their narrative.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained after officers deployed gas into the prison yard. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their cells. A multi-agency response followed, and all prisoners were eventually returned to their cells. Three guards were reportedly held hostage during the riot but were safely released with no major injuries. The prisoners never reached the main fence, preventing any escape.</p>

          <h2>'Bitcoin Family' Implements Decentralized Security Measures Following Kidnapping Concerns</h2>

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for their all-in investment in bitcoin, has overhauled their security measures following a wave of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives. They have ditched hardware wallets in favor of a hybrid system that is part analog and part digital. The system involves splitting seed phrases, encrypting them, and storing them through blockchain-based encryption services or hiding them across four continents. The family has also decided to avoid France entirely due to safety concerns.</p>
