          <p>A Colombian soldier was killed and two others were injured when an explosive device attached to a donkey detonated in the country's northwest region. The attack was attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN), a guerrilla group with whom the government has suspended peace negotiations. A local governor condemned the incident, highlighting the escalating violence from armed groups despite President Gustavo Petro's "total peace" initiative. The event underscores the persistent security challenges facing Colombia amid stalled peace efforts.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is anticipating a heatwave this weekend, with temperatures predicted to climb as high as 34°C (93°F) in some areas. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts across England, warning of potential significant impacts on health and social care services. While the heat will be widespread, it is not expected to surpass the year's highest temperature of 35.8°C. Climate scientists note that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, posing threats to wildlife and natural ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the nation faces a "rising" and unpredictable threat from Iran, urging the government to adopt a more robust, long-term strategy. The report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings against UK-based individuals since early 2022. The committee asserts that Iran's intelligence services are well-resourced and have a high appetite for risk. It criticizes the UK government for focusing on crisis management rather than addressing the full spectrum of threats posed by the Iranian state.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Western Australia are searching for a 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, who has been missing for over a week. She was last seen in the small town of Beacon, and her van was later discovered unattended with apparent mechanical issues near Karroun Hill, a remote area northeast of Perth. Police have expressed concern, noting her disappearance is unexplained and that she had been in regular contact with her family in Germany. While there is no current evidence of third-party involvement, detectives are pursuing all lines of inquiry in the broad investigation.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) in California could alter its political landscape, drawing comparisons to its use in New York City. The author notes that RCV could eliminate costly runoff elections, potentially increase voter turnout, and encourage less negative campaigning. Unlike New York's partisan primaries, California's top-two nonpartisan system combined with RCV might create unique strategic incentives, possibly leading to more centrist outcomes or giving underrepresented parties a better chance. The article suggests that despite unknowns, the potential benefits of RCV warrant serious consideration for reforming California's electoral system.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that police in Wales are examining historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former bishop and another ex-vicar from the Church in Wales. Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, claiming the institution ignored warnings about the men for years. One man recounted being sexually assaulted by former bishop Anthony Pierce in the 1980s, an incident he says was reported to church officials but resulted in no action, allowing Pierce to be promoted. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings and promised a culture review.</p>

Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed the casualties, while the Israeli military stated it was reviewing the incident. This attack occurred as indirect ceasefire and hostage-release negotiations continued in Doha, with a senior Israeli official suggesting an agreement could take another one to two weeks.

          <p>A controversial redistricting plan in Tarrant County, Texas, is seen by critics as a partisan effort by Republicans to secure political advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The newly approved map is criticized as racial gerrymandering, designed to dilute the votes of people of color and create a new Republican-leaning precinct. This local maneuver reflects a broader strategy as the GOP fears losing seats nationally and contends with a contentious Senate primary between incumbent John Cornyn and challenger Ken Paxton.

          <p>Despite President Trump's public praise, morale within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly hit a low point. Current and former employees describe a miserable work environment driven by pressure to meet unrealistic deportation quotas, a shift away from major criminal investigations toward minor civil immigration arrests, and a feeling of being bullied by administration officials. Many career agents are frustrated that the agency's mission has become more about generating high arrest numbers for political purposes than ensuring public safety.

          <p>All 31 workers trapped after a tunnel collapse at an industrial complex in Los Angeles were rescued safely on Wednesday evening. The collapse occurred in an 18-foot diameter tunnel being built for municipal wastewater management, trapping the workers behind a large pile of soil. The crew was able to climb over the debris and meet rescuers on the other side, who then shuttled them out of the tunnel's access point over five miles away. Over 100 LAFD personnel, including specialized Urban Search and Rescue teams, responded to the incident, which ended with no injuries.</p>

          <p>Germany's federal police are facing significant strain and poor working conditions due to increased border control duties aimed at limiting immigration. A new report from the Federal Police Commissioner highlights over 720,000 hours of overtime accrued by May 2025 for this task alone, leading to resource gaps in other areas. The commissioner described infrastructure at some checkpoints as "alarming," citing a lack of proper facilities for officers. The report also addresses the legal and ethical difficulties officers face, including concerns over racial profiling and the legality of turning back asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Years before a deadly flood, officials in Kerr County, Texas, knew they needed a better flood warning system but struggled to secure funding, a common problem for many U.S. communities. Their applications for federal FEMA grants were denied, and a state program offered insufficient support. This challenge is now exacerbated as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions in federal disaster preparedness funding, shifting the financial burden to states. Experts warn this creates a significant gap, as local communities often lack the resources to fund critical, life-saving infrastructure projects on their own.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a zonal pricing system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographical location. Instead, it will pursue reforms to the current national pricing system. Supporters of zonal pricing argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland, but some energy firms warned it might deter investment. The decision provides policy clarity for the energy industry, which had expressed concerns that a major overhaul could disrupt the market, though some consultants argue the move fails to address deep-rooted issues.
