            <p>Saturday's newspapers feature a range of stories, including Parliament's recall to address the British Steel crisis, potential tax increases by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Donald Trump's tariffs impacting markets. The Duke of Sussex claims his UK security was downgraded to prevent him from moving his family to the US. Other stories include a woman arrested for confiscating her children's iPads and the NHS England chief executive allegedly sleeping on the job. The Guardian reports the parliamentary sitting may lead to nationalization of British Steel, while The Times covers Trump's envoy suggesting Ukraine could be partitioned. </p>

The brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and are currently serving life sentences without parole.

The tariffs are expected to increase costs for foreign exporters and boost market share for domestic manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that he took a cognitive test during his physical exam, claiming to have answered every question correctly. This is the first physical of his second term. He said a report from his doctors would be released in the coming days. This follows criticisms about his predecessor, Joe Biden, and his cognitive state. Trump previously took a cognitive test in 2018 and reported acing it at the time.</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison is investigating the possibility that an idle, unconnected transmission line may have reenergized and caused the Eaton fire. The company is taking precautionary measures to harden other idle towers and lines. CEO Pedro Pizarro said induction, where a nearby active line induces current in the unconnected line, is a leading hypothesis. Edison is revising its internal manual on grounding procedures for idle equipment to prevent future incidents.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles court ruled that the resentencing hearing for the Menendez brothers can move forward, despite opposition from the district attorney. The brothers are seeking a lesser sentence, potentially making them eligible for freedom. They were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and are currently serving life in prison without parole. The ruling allows high-profile hearings to continue, determining whether the convicted killers will be resentenced.</p>

            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad, marking the second time the state has used this method in five weeks. Mahdi, who killed an off-duty police officer, chose the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. This is the fifth execution in South Carolina in less than eight months. The state resumed executions after a 13-year pause, enabled by laws allowing the firing squad and protecting the anonymity of lethal injection drug suppliers.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to facilitate Garcia's return, but also said the judge may have exceeded her authority. Garcia, an alleged gang member, was deported due to an administrative error. A judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide daily updates on steps taken to bring Garcia back to the US.</p>

It emphasizes the importance of democracy and the consequences of wrong decisions. While acknowledging differences between Venezuela and the U.S., the author warns against taking democracy for granted.</p>
