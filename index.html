          <p>Russia conducted one of its most significant air offensives against Ukraine, involving approximately 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 fatalities and numerous injuries across the nation. Ukrainian officials emphasized that the extensive attacks demonstrate Moscow's lack of interest in a truce, despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations. The Ukrainian air force reported shooting down a substantial portion of the incoming missiles and drones, but the attacks overwhelmed air defenses, particularly in western and southern regions. President Zelensky condemned the attacks and called for increased international pressure on Putin, accusing Russia of prolonging the war and causing daily casualties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements included in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," asserting they have a "moral component" because able-bodied individuals who refuse to work are "defrauding the system." Johnson argued that these requirements, mandating a minimum of 20 hours per week of work, job training, or volunteering, will strengthen Medicaid and SNAP programs by reducing fraud, waste, and abuse. He also refuted claims that the bill cuts Medicaid, despite analyses suggesting that many people could lose coverage under the new rules. Johnson's statements come as the bill faces opposition in the Senate, with some Republicans expressing concerns about the impact on low-income individuals.</p>

          <p>Federal judges are contemplating establishing their own armed security force, shifting protection responsibilities from the Department of Justice, due to increasing concerns about their safety and potential political interference from the Trump administration. This proposal emerged from a meeting where judges expressed worries that the administration might instruct the U.S. Marshals Service to withdraw protection from judges ruling against President Trump's policies. The idea involves placing the Marshals Service under the direct control of the Chief Justice to ensure judicial independence. This consideration arises amid a rise in threats against judges following President Trump's criticism of court rulings, including swatting attacks and intimidation tactics.</p>

Aston Villa's director of football operations expressed dissatisfaction with the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial match, while manager Unai Emery voiced his frustration over the disallowed goal and a late penalty awarded to Manchester United.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times criticizes the Supreme Court for increasingly handing power to President Trump, particularly through an unsigned order that effectively allows him to fire high-level officials. The author argues that the court's intervention undermines independent expertise within the executive branch and risks normalizing a "move fast and break things" approach to constitutional law. The decision effectively overruled a century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, granting the president considerable new authority. The author suggests that the court's actions embolden the administration to act outside traditional constitutional norms, potentially undermining the rule of law.</p>

Devoe pleaded not guilty to child abuse charges in 2023, with allegations including slapping and punching his son.

Speaker Johnson defended the bill as a pro-growth investment, emphasizing its tax cuts and deregulation efforts, while downplaying concerns about rising debt.

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party faces historically low approval ratings and struggles to regain its footing. Once reliable voter groups such as young people, Black voters, and Latinos have shifted toward the right, leading to a reevaluation of the party's strategies and messaging. Democrats are perceived as out of touch with working-class voters and increasingly seen as representing college-educated elites.

The charges against Alec Baldwin, who held the gun that fired the fatal shot, were dismissed.

          <p>Scientists are examining a mysterious metal sphere discovered in Colombia, suspected to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object, initially seen flying over Buga, Colombia, on March 2, lacks visible welds or joints and has mysterious symbols carved on its surface. X-rays revealed it comprises three layers of metal and contains nine microspheres inside, leading researchers to call it a very rare find. While some experts are skeptical, suggesting it could be an art project, others emphasize the importance of rigorous scientific investigation into such phenomena.</p>

          <p>A West Point professor resigned in protest of the Trump administration's changes to the academy, objecting to the president's choice to wear a Make America Great Again hat during his address to graduating cadets. Graham Parsons, a former professor of philosophy at West Point, criticized the administration for eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses, and censoring arguments to align with its ideological preferences. Parsons stated that the administration's orders are designed to indoctrinate rather than educate, leading him to conclude that his research agenda was effectively banned. He views the administration's actions as a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, his family is advocating for the commemoration of the square where he died as a historic site and a rallying call for police accountability. The family envisions a pedestrian plaza with a memorial, shops, and a library to honor Floyd's legacy and revitalize the area. The future of George Floyd Square remains uncertain, with a split city council debating between a pedestrian plaza and a flexible open street plan to increase vehicular traffic.

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuel projects, Japan remains a major public financier of gas and oil production, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. While leading the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to promote cooperation on net-zero emissions, many projects focus on developing natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage (CCS) technology. LNG is considered a "transitional fuel" for AZEC partner countries, but studies suggest it involves more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered. Critics argue that Japan's approach involves loopholes and greenwashing, hindering the transition to renewable energy in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 kids, a child expert has concluded that "emotionally safe parenting" is the most effective style. This method prioritizes a deep understanding of a child's emotional needs and teaches parents to foster resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Unlike other parenting styles, emotionally safe parenting focuses on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shame, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts by apologizing and reconnecting.</p>

The murder of Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. The family gathered in Houston for an event led by Rev. Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis held several commemorations. There seems to be a fading of the national "reckoning" with racism after Floyd's death, as President Donald Trump starts to roll back police reforms in Minneapolis and other cities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward Syria, marked by a meeting with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. Following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad, Israel launched hundreds of attacks in Syria to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands and to deter anti-Israel groups. However, since Trump's meeting with al-Shara, the Israeli strikes have largely ceased, potentially undercutting Israel's efforts to shape the post-Assad landscape. Some analysts suggest that Israel may be seeking to de-escalate and open dialogue with the Syrian regime, while others express concerns about the rise of an extremist government.</p>
