          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. The board argues that the deployment is ahistoric and based on false pretenses, as local law enforcement had the protests under control. They highlight that Governor Newsom did not request the deployment and views it as inflammatory, potentially escalating tensions. The editorial board contrasts Trump's actions with past instances of federal intervention, suggesting the move is creating the very chaos it claims to prevent.</p>

          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the offer as inadequate.

The RCN argues that the government has undervalued nursing and that years of pay erosion have caused many nurses to leave the profession.

This balancing act has cost the country over Â£500 million this year, potentially reaching Â£8 billion annually by 2030.
