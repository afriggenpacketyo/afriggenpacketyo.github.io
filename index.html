          <p>Bill Gates announced his intention to donate virtually all of his $108 billion fortune to the Gates Foundation within the next 20 years, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's philosophy that dying rich is a disgrace. This decision will accelerate the foundation's work, originally slated to continue until two decades after Gates' death, and now scheduled to close in 2045. The Gates Foundation aims to intensify its efforts to combat preventable childhood deaths, eradicate infectious diseases, and promote prosperity through education, with Gates expressing concern that recent foreign aid cuts could impede progress in these areas. He hopes to be around to see the impact of these efforts and believes that doubling down on these causes will have positive ripple effects beyond the foundation's closure.</p>

          <p>New York police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University after they occupied Butler Library, injuring two security officers. The protesters, defying a ban imposed after previous demonstrations, were seen vandalizing bookshelves with pro-Palestinian slogans. University President Claire Shipman requested NYPD assistance, stating that many involved were not students and that the disruption of academic activities was unacceptable. The arrests mark the first time Columbia has called the NYPD for an on-campus protest since April 2024, amidst rising tensions and accusations of antisemitism on campus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that climate change significantly intensified the deadly storms and flooding that struck the Midwest and South in early April, making the record-breaking rainfall about 9% heavier. The storms, which killed at least 24 people, were fueled by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by human-caused global warming. Researchers worry about the impact of staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which could hinder real-time warnings and emergency coordination. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events are also straining insurance markets, with homeowners in high-risk areas facing sharply rising costs.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a "fool" after the central bank decided to maintain current interest rates, citing economic uncertainties tied to tariffs. Trump argues that low inflation and falling energy costs warrant rate cuts to stimulate the economy, while the Fed fears that tariffs could trigger inflation. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and are not influenced by political pressure, amidst concerns that Trump might attempt to undermine the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has announced his intention to donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune, estimated at $107 billion, to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. This pledge will allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years, focusing on global health and education. Gates stated that this move is to maximize the impact of his giving while he is still alive and able to oversee the work, which he considers his second and final career. The foundation's CEO, Mark Suzman, anticipates a narrower focus on top priorities in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The British government has reportedly secured a trade deal with the United States, potentially easing the impact of recent tariff increases imposed by the U.S. This agreement is expected to support sectors like Britain's auto industry, which was particularly vulnerable to high tariffs. The deal is also likely to improve consumer and business confidence, which have recently declined. While the United States is an important trading partner for Britain, the agreement is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement and may not significantly boost the overall British economy, which faces other challenges, including domestic factors and global trade uncertainty.</p>

The decision balances Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony from witnesses. The judge noted that the scope of the family's proposed testimony is narrow and that they have previously given recorded interviews, reducing the risk of them altering their statements based on trial observations.

          <p>China and Russia are leveraging the 80th anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany to signal defiance of Western pressure and assert their legitimacy as global leaders. The event, featuring military parades and displays of national pride, is aimed at projecting the "unbreakable" bond between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Pundits suggest that historical memory surrounding World War II has become a potent tool for political agendas and a battleground for narratives and influence, particularly amid ongoing tensions between China and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Elementary and preschool spirit days, which require children to dress up according to a theme, are becoming increasingly common, adding stress and responsibility to parents' already busy lives. Parents often find out about these events last minute, leading to frantic searches for costumes or props, and they worry about their children feeling left out if they don't participate. While schools aim to build community and engagement, these events can also expose wealth disparities and create additional pressure for parents to curate elaborate outfits.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Office for Students (OfS) indicates that over 40% of universities in England anticipate financial deficits by this summer, despite efforts to cut costs through course closures and asset sales. The primary cause is a decline in international student enrollment, particularly after visa changes in January 2024. Universities are increasingly reliant on international student fees, but the OfS warns that future income projections may be overly optimistic. While the OfS is working with institutions facing financial viability concerns, students starting university this autumn are assured that courses will be delivered as advertised.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a Utah man on death row for 37 years, are arguing that his severe dementia prevents him from understanding why he is facing execution. Medical experts disagree on Menzies' mental capacity, with prosecutors arguing he is competent and defense lawyers claiming he has the cognitive ability of a three-year-old. The case raises questions about whether executing someone with dementia aligns with constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment, as the Supreme Court has previously ruled that a defendant must rationally understand why they are being executed for the execution to be considered just retribution.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are increasingly playing a larger role in American children's lives due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancies, and the need for child care assistance. They offer benefits such as better educational and mental health outcomes, fresh perspectives, and a more relaxed approach to child care. However, they are also stepping in to fill gaps in America's crumbling child care system, a role that can be financially and emotionally taxing. Experts suggest that policymakers should implement reforms that allow grandparents to be involved in their grandchildren's lives because they want to, not because their families have no other choice.</p>
