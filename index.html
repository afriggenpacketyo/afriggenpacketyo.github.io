            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat where he allegedly discussed military attack details on Houthis in Yemen, including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. President Trump defended Hegseth, dismissing the controversy as a "waste of time" and expressing confidence in his performance. Hegseth blamed the reports on "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed the President's support. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is already reviewing Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military actions.</p>

A lower court ruled the task force's structure unconstitutional, potentially impacting access to free preventive screenings and treatments.

            <p>Iowa is considering a constitutional amendment to address how traumatized witnesses testify in court, balancing a defendant's right to confront their accuser with the need to protect vulnerable individuals. The proposed amendment would allow limitations on the confrontation right for witnesses under 18 or with mental or developmental disabilities. The issue stems from a state Supreme Court decision requiring face-to-face encounters between defendants and witnesses. Concerns have been raised about potential impacts on defendants' rights, while supporters argue it's necessary to protect victims.</p>

            <p>A U.S. citizen, Jose Hermosillo, was wrongfully detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days, despite claiming his citizenship. Hermosillo was arrested after allegedly admitting to entering the U.S. illegally, but his family later provided proof of his citizenship. The incident highlights concerns about wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens amid increased immigration enforcement. While a senior DHS official claims Hermosillo's actions led to the arrest, the case raises questions about due process and the potential for errors in immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>China has warned against any trade deals that harm its interests as the Trump administration negotiates agreements with other countries. The Chinese commerce ministry stated it respects efforts to resolve trade disputes with the U.S. but will take "corresponding countermeasures" if deals are struck at China's expense. This warning comes amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with both countries imposing high tariffs on each other's goods. China emphasizes that seeking tariff exemptions by harming others will ultimately hurt everyone.</p>

Trump claims there is virtually no inflation and that the economy could slow down without rate cuts.

            <p>An overdraft occurs when you spend more money than you have in your checking account, resulting in a negative balance. This often happens with overdraft coverage, where your bank covers the transaction for a fee, or with overdraft protection, which transfers money from a linked account. Overdrafts can lead to fees, declined transactions, account closure, and debt collection. To avoid overdrafts, consider opting out of coverage, budgeting, scheduling direct deposits, maintaining a buffer, and setting up low balance alerts.</p>
