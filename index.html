          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is hopeful that a government shutdown can be avoided as the funding deadline approaches. He emphasized the Democratic goal of finding bipartisan common ground to secure a spending agreement that addresses the needs of the American people, particularly regarding healthcare. A key point of contention is the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats argue is urgent to prevent a shock to struggling families. Both Jeffries and his Republican counterpart, Steve Scalise, have expressed a desire to prevent a shutdown ahead of a planned meeting with President Trump.</p>

          <p>The superintendent for Des Moines Public Schools, Ian Roberts, was arrested by ICE for allegedly being in the United States illegally from Guyana and facing a final order of removal. Jackie Norris, the school board chair and a former aide to Michelle Obama, has urged the public to have "radical empathy," stating that officials do not yet have all the facts. In response, Iowa Republicans have initiated an investigation into the district's hiring procedures, questioning how Roberts was employed given his immigration status and a prior weapons charge.</p>

          <p>Voters in Zurich, Switzerland, have approved a measure to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums, with over 61% in favor. The new rules will completely ban gas-powered models and only permit the use of electric devices from October to December each year to combat noise and dust pollution. Supporters argued the devices are loud, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents of the ban contended that it unnecessarily complicates maintenance and represents an overreaching culture of prohibition.</p>

The final drew a record-breaking television audience of 5.8 million viewers, making it the most-watched women's rugby match in UK history. Players emphasized that their goal was not only to win but also to create a lasting legacy, similar to the impact of England's Lionesses in football.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's steel industry is expressing alarm over the United States' plan to potentially expand its list of "derivative" goods subject to steep tariffs. This move could subject a wide range of products containing European steel, from window frames to motorcycles, to the punitive duties originally aimed at Chinese imports. Industry leaders and officials are concerned that the ad-hoc expansion, which is being reviewed multiple times a year, creates significant uncertainty and adds costs for manufacturers. The situation has intensified calls for stronger trade measures to protect the viability of the EU's manufacturing sector and the jobs it supports.</p>

          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland city officials have strongly pushed back against President Trump's directive to send federal troops to the city, stating there is no need for such a deployment. In an open letter, over 100 community leaders argued that federal intervention would be counterproductive to the city's recovery, citing a decrease in violent crime and potential economic harm. Officials drew parallels to the 2020 deployment of federal agents, which they claim inflamed protests and harmed the community.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral," arguing it would tear the country apart. The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, would require legal migrants to reapply for visas under stricter rules and could lead to the deportation of people lawfully settled in the UK. While condemning the policy, Starmer distinguished between the policy itself and Reform UK's supporters, whom he believes are frustrated with years of Conservative governance rather than being inherently racist. The comments were made as Labour's party conference began amid concerns over the party's sliding poll ratings.</p>

Their album "Odessey and Oracle" was also initially ignored but is now regarded as a rock masterpiece.

Challenges like executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and time blindness can make traditional budgeting systems difficult to maintain. By setting up automatic payments for bills, savings, and investments to coincide with paydays, individuals can reduce the mental energy, or "spoons," required for financial tasks. This approach helps prioritize essential payments and savings goals, providing the freedom to spend remaining funds without the stress of potentially missing obligations.</p>

          <p>Michael Cohen, former lawyer for Donald Trump, stunned an MSNBC panel by asserting his belief that former FBI Director James Comey likely committed a crime and will be found guilty. During a discussion about Comey's recent indictment, Cohen claimed to have conducted his own investigation and suggested the Department of Justice possesses incriminating evidence. He drew on his own experience with a "weaponized DOJ," arguing that the sheer volume of documents the government holds makes a conviction probable, despite the panel's skepticism and reminders that Cohen himself had pleaded guilty to breaking the law.</p>

Conversely, leaders from Bolivia and Colombia were highly critical, with Bolivian President Luis Arce accusing the administration of seeking hegemony at the expense of global stability.

          <p>A CNBC investigation has highlighted the proliferation of AI-powered "nudify" applications and websites that allow users to easily create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes of real people. The report focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a friend had used their social media photos to generate such content, only to find they had little legal recourse because no existing laws were broken. This has spurred local legislative efforts to hold the creators of these services accountable. Experts note the technology has become incredibly accessible, causing significant emotional trauma for victims who feel their identity and body have been violated.</p>

The flotilla has recently faced suspected drone attacks, which Thunberg condemned as violations of international law.

          <p>Money expert Ramit Sethi argues that certain underlying beliefs prevent many people from increasing their income, even when they have the desire and ability. He identifies three key mental roadblocks: the false notion that you "should know how to do this by now," the fantasy that success should come easily if you are talented, and the habit of procrastinating by telling yourself you can "start later." Sethi emphasizes that earning more is a skill that requires learning, sustained effort, and immediate action, urging people to abandon these limiting mindsets to make real progress toward their financial goals.</p>

The initiative is central to Labour's economic growth strategy and emulates the post-war government's new town developments.

The persistent abuse directed at McIlroy grew so intense that state police were brought in to escort his group. Despite the challenging environment, McIlroy won both of his matches.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are leveraging an impending government funding deadline to demand that Republicans reverse cuts to Medicaid and extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act. With government funding set to expire, Democrats have refused to support a short-term spending bill unless their healthcare priorities are addressed, setting the stage for a potential shutdown. The party believes this firm stance on healthcare provides rare leverage against the Trump administration and could rally voters ahead of the midterm elections.

Other myths include the fear of being lonely, as expat communities are often quick to form, and the belief that life abroad is a perfect fairy tale, when it still involves bureaucracy and personal challenges.
