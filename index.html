          <p>Former GOP senator Richard Burr alleges the Biden administration failed to stop illegal Chinese-made e-cigarette products from entering the U.S., creating a public health crisis. Burr, now a nicotine regulation advocate, claims the FDA's inaction allowed a majority of currently sold vaping products to be unauthorized and often marketed to minors. He is urging the new Trump administration to reform the approval process and increase enforcement at the border. An FDA spokesperson refuted the claims, citing numerous enforcement actions taken against illicit products during the period in question.</p>

          <p>Storm Floris has struck the UK, with Scotland experiencing the most severe impact, including winds over 80mph that left thousands without power. The storm caused significant travel disruptions, with cancellations of trains, planes, and ferries, and prompted warnings of a "threat to life." Network Rail is working to clear debris from tracks, with disruptions expected to continue. The storm, the sixth of the season, also led to the cancellation of events like the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.</p>

          <p>AI software company Palantir announced quarterly revenues exceeding $1 billion for the first time, a 48% year-over-year increase that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company also raised its full-year revenue and operating income forecasts, causing its stock to rally in after-hours trading. CEO Alex Karp highlighted the company's efficiency, aiming for significant revenue growth while reducing headcount. The strong performance is partly attributed to increased U.S. government contracts and a surge in investor confidence in its AI capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health saw its stock fall after reporting second-quarter revenue of $544.8 million, which missed analysts' forecasts despite a 73% year-over-year increase. While earnings per share beat estimates, the company's third-quarter revenue guidance was also met with a lukewarm reception. The company has faced controversy over its sale of compounded weight-loss drugs, which contributed to a short-lived partnership with Novo Nordisk ending. Despite the revenue miss, the company reported significant growth in net income compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

This action aims to block a GOP-led effort to pass a new congressional map that could add several Republican seats. Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state police to locate and return the absent Democrats. The lawmakers, who fled to other states, argue they are protesting an attempt to rig future elections, while Republicans maintain they are abdicating their duties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has endorsed a controversial Florida-based migrant detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for a new federal strategy. The plan involves establishing similar state-run facilities near airports in states like Arizona and Nebraska to expedite deportations.

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson made a controversial visit to the occupied West Bank, expressing strong support for Israeli settlements and calling the territory the "rightful property of the Jewish people." The trip, the highest-profile visit by a U.S. official since 2020, was condemned by the Palestinian foreign ministry as a violation of international law that undermines peace efforts. Johnson's visit with other Republican lawmakers comes amid growing international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and contradicts stated U.S. policy on settlements.</p>

These rules require multiple jurisdictions to approve projects, leading to prolonged disputes and increased costs.

Fixed annuities are presented as a safe option, offering guaranteed, competitive yields that can lock in today's elevated rates before they potentially fall.

          <h2>Nigel Farage Calls for Police to Release Immigration Status of Charged Criminal Suspects</h2>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has demanded that police publicly release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His call follows the arrest of two men, reported to be Afghan nationals, in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. Farage argued that withholding such information fuels online conspiracy theories and that transparency is necessary, dismissing concerns about contempt of court. Current national policing guidelines in the UK do not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, researchers have identified the cause of a wasting disease that has killed billions of sea stars along the North American West Coast. A new study pinpoints a specific bacterium, Vibrio pectinocida, as the culprit behind the epidemic that nearly wiped out the keystone sunflower sea star species. The collapse of the sunflower sea star population led to an explosion of their prey, purple sea urchins, which in turn destroyed vital kelp forests. This discovery provides a crucial breakthrough for conservation efforts, enabling targeted recovery strategies like developing diagnostic tests and breeding disease-resistant stars.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a pilot program that could require some foreign nationals applying for business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to $15,000. The program targets travelers from countries with high rates of visa overstays or deficient security screening. The measure, which stems from a Trump executive order, is described as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to ensure their citizens depart the U.S. on time. Critics argue the policy will deter tourism and negatively impact the U.S. economy by creating an insurmountable barrier for many potential visitors.</p>

          <p>The UK government has appointed business leader Moni Mannings to chair a new diversity and outreach committee for the national honours system. The goal is to ensure that awards, such as knighthoods, better reflect the diversity of the entire country. The move follows analysis showing that higher honours disproportionately go to individuals in southern England and from affluent backgrounds. The new committee will advise the government and encourage a wider range of nominations from under-represented regions and communities, aiming to make the system more merit-based regardless of background.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning uncontrollably in central California's Los Padres National Forest, having already scorched over 65,000 acres. The blaze, which is only 3% contained, is threatening more than 450 structures and has prompted evacuation orders in the region. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames, but their efforts are being challenged by hot, dry conditions and erratic winds. The fire started from several smaller blazes on Friday, and its cause is currently under investigation.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: The History and Effectiveness of Legislative Walkouts as a Political Tactic</h2>

          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democrats to block a Republican redistricting plan highlights a high-stakes political tactic known as "breaking quorum." This article analyzes the history of such walkouts in Texas and other states, noting they have become more frequent with increasing partisanship. While the strategy is effective at delaying legislation and drawing national attention to an issue, its long-term success in permanently blocking a bill is limited, as governors can call repeated special sessions. The tactic often exacerbates political tensions but can also elevate the profiles of the lawmakers involved and galvanize national support for their cause.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a long-running defamation lawsuit filed by Trump Media CEO and former congressman Devin Nunes against MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and NBC Universal. The case centered on Maddow's on-air statement that Nunes had "refused" to provide the FBI with documents from a suspected Russian spy. The judge ruled that Nunes failed to prove that Maddow acted with "actual malice," a necessary standard in defamation cases involving public figures. This marks another legal defeat for Nunes, who has filed numerous unsuccessful lawsuits against media organizations and critics.</p>
