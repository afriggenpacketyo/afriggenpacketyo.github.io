          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to encourage savers to move money from low-interest accounts into stocks and shares. Under the proposal, banks would proactively send investment offers to customers, supported by a government advertising campaign. The "Leeds Reforms," championed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, also include making a low-deposit mortgage scheme for first-time buyers permanent. While aimed at boosting the UK economy and providing better returns for savers, concerns have been raised about potential risks for inexperienced investors and the possibility of increased fraud.

          <p>Alphabet's Google has announced a significant $25 billion investment over the next two years in data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The investment will span states covered by the PJM Interconnection, the largest electric grid in the United States. As part of this initiative, Google will also invest $3 billion to modernize two hydropower plants in Pennsylvania to support the increasing energy demands of AI and data centers. This move comes as the PJM grid, which includes the world's largest data center market in northern Virginia, faces challenges in meeting rising electricity consumption.</p>

          <p>China has officially launched a national cyber ID system, which authorities state is currently voluntary for internet users. The system provides an encrypted virtual ID to use for online account verification, obscuring a person's real name and official ID number from websites. This initiative follows years of government mandates requiring real-name registration for various online services. Despite official assurances that the system aims to protect citizen identity information, experts and some internet users have expressed significant concerns regarding potential privacy violations and increased censorship capabilities.</p>

          <p>In an effort to encourage marriage and address declining birth rates, the central Chinese province of Hubei has increased its paid marriage leave to 15 days. This policy is the latest among various local government incentives designed to foster a more "family-friendly society." The move comes as China faces a steep decline in marriage registrations, which have fallen to their lowest level since record-keeping began in 1978. Despite such initiatives, many young couples still view the high costs associated with weddings and bride prices as a significant barrier to marriage.</p>

For charitable giving, the bill aims to encourage donations from average Americans but limits deductions for the wealthiest earners, which could impact overall philanthropic contributions.

          <h2>Recent Polls Indicate Californians Hold Negative Views on Leadership and State of Democracy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of recent polls reveals a pessimistic mood among California residents, with a majority believing the state is on the wrong track and expressing low trust in their leaders. A UC Irvine poll found a 2-to-1 margin of residents feeling the state is headed in the wrong direction, citing political division and economic concerns. Similarly, a UC Berkeley poll showed low trust in Governor Gavin Newsom and the state legislature. This distrust extends to the federal government, with a striking number of Californians from across the political spectrum expressing fears that American democracy itself is under attack.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Proposed Tariff on Foreign Films Would Harm Global and American Cinema</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece critiques President Trump's proposal for a 100% tariff on foreign-produced films, arguing it would stifle cultural exchange and harm the American film industry. The author uses the Armenian film "Amerikatsi" as an example of how international collaboration creates vital art that preserves cultural memory. The article contends that modern cinema is an inherently global ecosystem, and penalizing foreign films would also punish American artists, producers, and distributors who rely on these partnerships. Such a policy would lead to a more parochial and less diverse cultural landscape in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that a recent executive order by the Trump administration threatens to undermine the historical accuracy of U.S. National Parks. The order directs the Interior Department to remove any signage or material that "inappropriately disparages Americans" and instead emphasize "American greatness." It also enlists park visitors to report content they find offensive via QR codes, a move critics call an effort to replace scholarship with uncritical patriotism. The author warns this will sanitize complex historical narratives about civil rights, labor struggles, and immigration, distorting the nation's past to fit a political agenda.</p>

          <p>A Texas-based exotic animal dealer, Trisha Denise Meyer, has been sentenced to six months of probation and ordered to pay $30,000 in restitution for selling a jaguar cub. In 2021, Meyer illegally transported and sold the endangered animal for $26,000 to a man in California, where owning jaguars is illegal. The cub was later found abandoned at a wildlife sanctuary, malnourished and in poor condition. Meyer, who faced a maximum of eight years in prison, pleaded guilty to one count of interstate sale of an endangered species, resulting in the much lighter sentence.</p>

The program, which has collected DNA from over a million veterans to study health issues like PTSD and cancer, relies on supercomputers from the Department of Energy for data analysis. Critical agreements for computer access are set to expire, and their renewal is uncertain under the Trump administration.

          <p>Amid new geopolitical realities, including the war in Ukraine and a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, France is positioned to play a pivotal role in Europe's push for defense autonomy. French President Emmanuel Macron has long advocated for "strategic autonomy" and plans to double the country's defense budget between 2017 and 2027. With a robust defense industry and a maintained "war culture," France has expertise across all sectors, but faces hurdles like raw material sourcing and a need for more skilled engineers. Experts suggest that for Europe's rearmament to succeed, France must cooperate diplomatically with partners and not act alone.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $69,770, significantly higher than in other major markets. The high price is largely due to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against competitors like BMW. Experts believe Tesla's initial move is more about "testing the waters" than achieving mass-market sales in a country where top-selling cars are a fraction of the price. The company has not yet committed to local manufacturing, which would be necessary to lower costs.</p>

The 35-year-old Hampshire player replaces off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who is out for the series with a broken finger. Dawson's selection comes as a reward for outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His inclusion provides a direct replacement for Bashir and also strengthens England's lower-order batting, offering an unexpected opportunity to press his claim for a regular spot.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent announcement to supply weapons to Ukraine through NATO has sparked backlash from some of his most ardent supporters within the "Make America Great Again" movement. Key conservative allies, including Rep.

They expressed skepticism that taxpayers would not ultimately bear the cost, viewing the deal as an unnecessary escalation in a "European war." The White House has defended the move, stating that European allies will pay for the U.S.-manufactured weapons.</p>

The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are intended to help phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, it also emphasizes the critical need for more public charging infrastructure, as 40% of UK households lack driveways for home charging.
