          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder and stalking charges in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, sparking a rally of supporters at the NYC courthouse. Supporters view Mangione as a 'political prisoner' due to Thompson's alleged denial of cancer care to children, while critics condemn the killing. The case has drawn attention due to Mangione's capture, court appearances, and the Attorney General's decision to seek the death penalty. Judge Garnett urged prosecutors to limit public commentary to ensure a fair trial, and set a trial date for 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, separatist sentiments are gaining momentum fueled by concerns over Liberal rule and perceived neglect of the province's interests. Some residents express a preference for joining the United States, citing cultural and economic alignment with states like Montana and Texas. The possibility of a unity crisis is openly discussed, with warnings that Western Canadians may not tolerate another Liberal government.

The Justice Department is pushing for Google to sell Chrome as part of an antitrust case, arguing that it illegally monopolized the search market. Google argues that features like safe browsing rely on shared infrastructure and that disentangling Chrome would be unprecedented. However, a computer science expert argued that Chrome could be divested without breaking its functionality, despite Google's significant contributions to the underlying Chromium project.</p>

          <p>A case of measles has been confirmed in a Los Angeles County resident who recently traveled from Texas, where a significant outbreak is occurring. This is the third measles case reported in L.A. County this year, with previous cases linked to international travel. Health officials are working to identify potential exposures, and this incident highlights the ongoing risk of measles outbreaks, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. Symptoms of measles include high fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic rash.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that listening to a minute of 100 hertz sound may prevent motion sickness by stimulating the inner ear and improving balance. The study involved volunteers who were exposed to the sound before riding a swing, driving simulator, or car, with 70-80% experiencing alleviated symptoms. The research could be beneficial with the rise of self-driving vehicles, as passengers are more prone to motion sickness than drivers.</p>

          <h2>Judge Warns Against Politicizing Mangione Case</h2>

          <p>The judge overseeing the federal prosecution of Luigi Mangione, accused of killing a health insurance executive, has warned the U.S. attorney general to refrain from public commentary to ensure a fair trial. Mangione pleaded not guilty to a murder charge that could result in the death penalty. The case has become politicized, with some viewing Mangione as a hero and others as a symbol of chaos, and the judge, Margaret Garnett, wants to depoliticize the circuslike atmosphere surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on foreign funding and alleging a failure to fully disclose significant funding from foreign sources. The investigation revives past criticisms about UC Berkeley's partnership with China's Tsinghua University. UC Berkeley denies the claims and states it has been cooperating with federal inquiries. The university says it's no longer affiliated with TBSI.</p>
