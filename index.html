          <p>Following a deadly attack on Indian tourists in Kashmir, military tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan, resulting in exchanges of small arms fire along the Line of Control for three consecutive nights. Pakistan has called for a neutral investigation into the attack and has denied India's accusations of supporting cross-border terrorism. India has taken reprisal measures, including suspending a water-sharing treaty and downgrading diplomatic ties. These events underscore the ongoing conflict over Kashmir, a region divided between the two nations since 1947, with both claiming the territory in full.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes the US administration's imposition of 'reciprocal tariffs' on trading partners, arguing that these actions disrupt global markets and harm economic growth, especially for developing nations. The author contends that while the US claims to be disadvantaged by trade deficits, it has significantly benefited from globalization through multinational profits and inexpensive goods. The article further suggests that when considering trade in goods, services, and local sales, China and the US have benefited relatively equally from their bilateral trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Tees Valley mayor Lord Houchen has suggested that the Conservative Party might need to form a coalition with Reform UK to prevent a Labour government, especially if the combined number of Tory and Reform MPs creates a significant majority. This statement comes as Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has ruled out a coalition with Nigel Farage's party at a national level, arguing that Reform seeks to destroy the Tories. Houchen's remarks highlight the challenges the Tories face with the rise of Reform, potentially splitting the right-of-center vote.</p>

          <p>China has extended anti-corruption rules to village chiefs and other grass-roots officials to strengthen supervision of rural government workers.
