          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at her home in New York City at the age of 87, reportedly from natural causes. Swit's portrayal of Houlihan, a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce, spanned 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983. As the show evolved, Swit aimed to portray Houlihan as a complex character undergoing constant development, even if it meant sacrificing some jokes. Swit won two Emmys and was nominated for four Golden Globes for her performances on "M*A*S*H."</p>

Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details on the structure of the deal, especially after President Biden initially blocked the acquisition on national security grounds. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick stated that the U.S. government will retain a "golden share," ensuring U.S. government approval over key board members and production levels. The "golden share" likely wouldn't take the form of an equity stake by the U.S. government, but rather a contractual right for the U.S. government to veto certain actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a town hall in Iowa, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst defended proposed Medicaid cuts under President Trump's legislative agenda, responding to concerns that the cuts would cause people to die with the statement, "Well, we all are going to die." Ernst clarified that the focus would be on protecting those who meet eligibility requirements, while removing those who have other benefit options. The bill, which aims to create savings by targeting "waste, fraud, and abuse," has faced criticism for potentially affecting healthcare access for vulnerable individuals, particularly those with low-paying jobs.</p>

The legislation mandates school boards to develop policies limiting cellphone use during the school day, with exceptions for students with specific educational or health needs. Research suggests that cellphone use in classrooms can negatively impact students' grades and social skills.</p>

Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer, UBS, and Jefferies have highlighted Costco's ability to manage costs, gain market share, and leverage its membership model. Costco's scale has helped it absorb tariff and inflation headwinds, driving an 8.1% gain in adjusted comps and widening its pricing lead over competitors. The company's consistent execution and potential stock split are also seen as positive factors.</p>

He mentioned that he is undergoing treatment and is confident in beating the illness.

          <p>The last hospital providing health services in the North Gaza governorate, al-Awda hospital, has been evacuated after an order from the Israeli military. The hospital's director said the evacuation leaves no health facility working in the north. The hospital faced bombing and shooting before the evacuation, with the director reporting threats from Israeli forces to bomb or kill those inside if they did not comply. Patients were evacuated to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern over the loss of this critical lifeline.</p>
