            <p>Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times is set for a retrial after an appeals court overturned a previous ruling. Palin alleges that a 2017 editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation and career. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but claims it was an honest mistake that was quickly corrected. The retrial comes amid heightened scrutiny of media outlets by political figures, with the trial expected to last a week and address issues of evidence exclusion and jury instructions.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs argues that ESG investors should re-evaluate their stance on oil and gas companies, similar to the shift seen with defense stocks after the Russia-Ukraine war. The firm believes the energy transition will be longer than expected, requiring continued investment in oil and gas development. They also emphasize that oil and gas companies are significant investors in low-carbon energy and play a crucial role in ensuring affordable energy, especially for emerging markets.

Analysts predict that exports may weaken in the coming months as U.S. tariffs escalate, potentially causing supply chain disruptions and inflation in the U.S. The Chinese government has reiterated its call for negotiations with Washington while also preparing to implement countermeasures against the U.S.</p>

With the rise of Donald Trump, questions are being raised about how the world can pivot away from the U.S. and build a new global order, but the prospect of a world without a central authority induces a feeling of vertigo and fear of anarchy.</p>

Noboa has defined his presidency through a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs. His left-wing challenger, Luisa GonzÃ¡lez, has disputed the results and claimed fraud. Noboa's victory gives him a mandate to continue his self-described "war" on drug gangs, which includes militarizing the streets and prisons, as well as building new maximum-security facilities.</p>

            <p>China's exports saw a significant increase of 12.4% in March, driven by businesses rushing to ship goods before anticipated tariff hikes from the United States. However, analysts suggest this could be a "final hurrah," with exports expected to decline in the coming months. Imports also fell, and the global trade landscape faces uncertainty due to drastic tariff increases and reversals. Trump has threatened new cumulative tariffs of 145% on all Chinese goods, further complicating the situation.</p>
