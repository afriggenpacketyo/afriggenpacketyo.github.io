          <p>A new North Korean naval destroyer launch ended in failure, with leader Kim Jong Un calling it a "criminal act" due to carelessness. State media reported that the warship sustained damage to its bottom during the witnessed launch. Kim ordered immediate repairs ahead of a major Workers' Party Central Committee meeting, emphasizing the political significance of restoring the vessel. The ship, a 5,000-ton destroyer-class vessel, had previously undergone tests involving supersonic and strategic cruise missiles.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump confronted South Africa's President Ramaphosa with claims of a "white genocide," presenting a video with unverified footage. Ramaphosa refuted these claims, emphasizing that South Africa is a multi-party democracy where all voices can be heard, and that government policy opposes such sentiments. Trump's claims have been widely discredited, with Ramaphosa pointing out the presence of white members in his delegation as evidence against genocide. The meeting, intended to improve trade relations, became tense as Trump pressed Ramaphosa on land confiscation and violence against white farmers.</p>

          <p>The Army is implementing a two-phase plan to separate service members with gender dysphoria, following President Trump's directive to prioritize military excellence and readiness. The first phase allows service members diagnosed with or having a history of gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate with potential separation pay. After a June 6 deadline, the Army will begin involuntary separations, using records reflecting service members' sex at birth to identify those who did not self-identify. The Army spokesperson said all service members will be treated with dignity and respect throughout the process.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are preparing to vote on revoking California's vehicle emissions waivers, which allow the state to set stricter standards than federal regulations. Democrats are calling the planned vote "the nuclear option", arguing that it is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent by overruling the Senate Parliamentarian. The waivers in question include those related to reducing tailpipe emissions and the "EV mandate" that aims to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. California officials have vowed to sue if Congress revokes the waivers, which are supported by 16 other states and D.C.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas 4¬∞C warmer than normal, creating a marine heatwave that could impact marine life. The heatwave, most intense off the west coast of Ireland, is driven by climate change and a warm spring, with scientists expecting 2025 to be one of the hottest years on record. While the warmer waters may be noticed by swimmers, they could disrupt breeding patterns, bring jellyfish blooms, and cause harmful algae growth. Scientists are surprised by the heatwave's persistence, noting its potential to push up land temperatures as well.</p>

While the Trump administration has granted refugee status to some Afrikaners citing violence and discrimination, others in the community argue that whites remain economically strong and safe in South Africa. Critics suggest that Trump's stance may be influenced by right-wing groups and the South African government's opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza. Some Afrikaners say they feel safe and sleep with their doors open, while participating in projects to train the next generation of agricultural workers.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to the budget package, aiming to secure passage of his second-term agenda, though details of the final legislation are still unclear. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the meeting "productive," but some Republicans are pushing back, wanting steeper spending cuts. The bill faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans over the state and local tax deduction. Trump has pressured members to fall in line, warning that any GOP member who doesn't back the bill would be "knocked out so fast."</p>

          <p>A New York police inspector, Terrell Anderson, was transferred after allowing dozens of prospective officers to continue in the hiring process despite failing mental health standards. Anderson, former head of the candidate assessment division, reportedly overrode negative psychological reports for 80 candidates. The NYPD is investigating the matter, which comes as the department faces a shortage of officers. Anderson, who has no history of disciplinary issues, is known for his innovative work with community leaders and his efforts to recruit officers of color.</p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing his government of seizing land from white farmers, claims that have been widely discredited. However, Trump himself has used eminent domain to seize land for his border wall in the U.S., a power he also advocated for as a developer. Trump's accusations against South Africa stem from a law allowing the government to seize privately held land without compensation under certain circumstances. The law is part of South Africa's effort to address racial inequities, but Trump has falsely accused the country of confiscating land.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion ban, which only allows abortions to save the life of the mother. The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. The bill needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk. The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of sexual assault or incest.</p>
