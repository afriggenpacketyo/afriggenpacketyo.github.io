          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died after being struck by a vessel in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The collision, which occurred Saturday afternoon, nearly capsized the boat and threw a passenger overboard, who is reported to be unharmed. Officials from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death is scheduled for Monday. Authorities have advised boaters to maintain a safe distance from the carcass.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Meta deleted approximately 10 million Facebook accounts as part of a major initiative to combat spam, impersonation, and unoriginal content. The company is cracking down on accounts that repeatedly repurpose others' work without adding significant value, aiming to boost the visibility of authentic creators. This policy shift will affect content ranking and monetization, penalizing accounts with duplicate posts by reducing their reach. Meta is also exploring new methods to more clearly credit original creators, encouraging unique posts and transformative content like commentary or reaction videos.</p>

          <p>The United States and Canada failed to reach a new trade agreement by a self-imposed Friday deadline, extending a six-month tariff war. Despite recent negotiations, issues surrounding American tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos remain unresolved, with President Trump's criticism of Canada's foreign policy further complicating matters. While Canadian officials state they are not seeking a rushed deal, businesses on both sides are feeling the pressure from retaliatory tariffs. Talks are expected to continue, but the lack of an agreement prolongs economic uncertainty for deeply integrated industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his firm's economists do not foresee a recession or interest rate hikes this year, though economic growth will be slow. He anticipates the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady until mid-next year to combat inflation, which may not reach the 2% target until 2027. Moynihan noted that business caution is currently driven more by uncertainty over new administration policies on trade, deregulation, and immigration than by the direct impact of tariffs. He also commented on the long-term impact of AI, suggesting it will reshape jobs but that the economy has historically adapted to such technological shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report that included downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the dismissal, suggesting patterns that raised questions about the data's reliability. Critics argue the move undermines the credibility of government economic data and appears to be a politically motivated response to unfavorable numbers. Hassett countered that the president wants his own appointee in the role to ensure the data is more transparent.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman has been arrested in New Zealand and charged with child neglect after a two-year-old girl was discovered inside her suitcase in a bus's luggage compartment. The bus driver became suspicious after noticing the bag moving and opened it to find the child, who was reportedly very hot but otherwise physically unharmed. The incident occurred at a bus stop in Kaiwaka, a town in the country's north. The girl was taken to a hospital for medical assessment, and the relationship between her and the woman has not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>Victims of mis-sold car finance in the UK are expected to receive less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The plan follows a Supreme Court ruling that found extremely large, hidden commissions to be unfair, though it deemed the general practice not unlawful. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The first payouts are anticipated next year, providing some resolution for affected motorists.</p>

          <p>China's advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of an aircraft catapult launch, a critical milestone for its naval aviation capabilities. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a position for take-off from the vessel. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy, which allows for launching heavier and more varied aircraft. This successful drill marks significant progress as the carrier prepares for its expected entry into service this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling statements and factual inaccuracies, have renewed questions about his mental fitness. During a recent trip, the 79-year-old president made confusing claims and drifted off-topic, a pattern of behavior that has been observed for over a year. While Trump has consistently dismissed such concerns, describing himself as a "stable genius," some mental health experts and political opponents argue his cognitive state shows signs of deterioration. The White House aggressively pushes back, stating the president is "mentally and physically sharper than ever before."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals in a rocky marriage without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all joint assets, liabilities, and accounts while still married, which simplifies the process if a divorce occurs. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided. While broaching the topic can be difficult, attorneys advise that clear communication can prevent greater conflict later on.</p>

          <p>A new report from HR technology company Checkr has identified the top 10 U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential, with mid-sized cities like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin leading the list. The study analyzed the 100 largest metro areas based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings suggest a shift away from traditional big-city dominance, as locations like Salt Lake City and Omaha offer strong job markets and greater affordability. Major hubs like New York and Los Angeles did not make the top 10.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming phrases can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums. Instead of punitive language, phrases that validate a child's feelings, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you," can de-escalate the situation. This approach focuses on connection over control, reassuring the child and helping their nervous system regulate. The article suggests that by making a child feel safe and understood, parents can reduce the intensity and frequency of emotional outbursts.</p>

With a light economic calendar, these earnings reports and any updates on tariffs from Washington are expected to be the primary drivers of market activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the number. Instead, he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and relationships that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to a professional team. Financial experts commented that this approach can be healthy, as it shifts focus from a potentially obsessive chase for wealth to more tangible goals and values. They advise that tracking cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal goals can be more powerful than fixating on net worth.</p>
