          <p>Jeal Sutherland, 57, pleaded guilty in federal court to a murder-for-hire plot where he planned to kill a man and dispose of the remains by feeding them to hogs.

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, cautioned that consumers may soon see higher prices due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is beyond what retailers and suppliers can absorb, leading to concerns about the impact on consumers. The retailer beat quarterly earnings expectations but fell slightly short on sales estimates, and it maintained its full-year forecast. Walmart also reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in both the U.S. and globally.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the Army's 250th anniversary on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. While Mr. Trump has confirmed the plans, stating it's not tied to his birthday and the cost is minimal compared to the value, some Democrats have criticized the event as wasteful. This parade is part of a broader interest by Trump in military pageantry, dating back to his first term.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the Trump administration's increasing reliance on officials holding multiple positions, a practice known as dual-hatting, due to difficulty in filling key roles. Marco Rubio, for instance, serves as secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security adviser. This trend reflects the administration's struggles to find qualified individuals willing to serve and raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, neglect, and overall dysfunction. The article suggests that this approach is an attempt to learn from the first term's slow appointment process but ultimately leads to inefficiency and risks undermining crucial government functions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's reduction of tariffs on Chinese goods offered some respite to businesses, but many small companies still face challenges due to the remaining 30 percent tariff. The temporary nature of the easing, set to last 90 days, creates uncertainty for long-term planning and investment decisions. Small business owners are contemplating measures such as cutting cheaper items, considering layoffs, and pausing new product introductions to cope with increased costs. While large retailers can absorb some costs, smaller companies with tight margins struggle to negotiate with suppliers, highlighting the need for a long-term trade deal to ensure stability.</p>

The case raises constitutional questions about the 14th Amendment and Supreme Court precedent, with potential implications for the President's ability to enact policies without congressional approval.

          <p>Disneyland's new "World of Color Happiness!" show, part of the park's 70th-anniversary celebration, has sparked mixed reactions with its focus on all things "happiness." While the show begins with a nostalgic tribute to Disney classics, it quickly shifts to an energetic, music-driven production led by Joy from "Inside Out." Some critics find the show's relentless emphasis on happiness to be somewhat oppressive and disconnected from the broader range of emotions explored in Disney's films. However, the pre-show featuring the Muppets, which brings comedic chaos and charm, has been widely praised.</p>

The article highlights the power struggles within OpenAI, the company's shift from altruistic ideals to aggressive commercialization, and the broader implications for AI governance. It argues that the future of AI development is being shaped by a small group of Silicon Valley elites, raising questions about economic value and societal impact.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients are unlikely to receive a tax break on their benefits, despite President Trump's previous suggestion, due to limitations on changing the program through the reconciliation process. A Republican-backed bill in the House includes other tax breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay, but excludes the Social Security provision. Instead, the bill offers an extra $4,000 deduction for filers 65 and older. While eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits might sound appealing, it could hurt the program's long-term stability, potentially leading to earlier depletion of trust funds and automatic benefit cuts.</p>
