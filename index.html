          <h2>Researchers Make Progress in Restoring Bodily Functions After Spinal Cord Injuries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 19:14:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in Switzerland have developed a 'digital bridge' that wirelessly connects an implant on the brain to a spinal cord stimulator, showing promise in restoring movement and other bodily functions in paralyzed individuals. This technology bypasses the injury, sending signals from the brain to the intact part of the spinal cord to enable movement. While walking again is a top priority for some, many patients are more concerned with restoring functions like bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. The researchers are also exploring the potential of spinal cord stimulation for individuals with Parkinson's disease, and are now focused on executing clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced that it will release Edan Alexander, an American citizen held hostage, as part of ongoing mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire and resume aid delivery to Gaza. The release is intended as a gesture of goodwill before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Alexander, a 20-year-old Israeli-American soldier, was abducted during the October 7 attack. While the United States has informed Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of other hostages, Israel maintains that negotiations will take place amidst continued fighting.</p>

Hayes sustained non-life-threatening injuries and is currently recovering. The crash occurred when a Dodge Durango, driven by Hayes, collided with a Kia Soul making a left turn. Police have stated that there were no signs of impairment and alcohol is not believed to be a factor, but the investigation is ongoing to determine if speed played a role.

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a bike accident, has regained the ability to walk with the help of a 'digital bridge' connecting an implant on her brain to a spinal cord stimulator. This technology, developed by Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine, allows patients to move paralyzed limbs using their own thoughts. Carsteanu-Dombi, who had no feeling below her waist, was able to take her first steps after training with the digital bridge, which she describes as gaining a superpower. Researchers hope to launch clinical trials in the United States in the next few years to make this technology more widely available.</p>

          <p>Transnational crime rings are exploiting stolen identities to steal billions in taxpayer money from federal and state governments, particularly through online applications for relief programs. This problem has exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting that over a trillion dollars in pandemic relief money was lost to fraud. Often, these fraud rings are impersonating Americans using their stolen personal data, and the stolen funds are going to foreign adversarial nation states, including China and Russia. The FBI is working to combat this fraud, but officials say they are outnumbered and the schemes are complex and difficult to unravel.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to exclude Zepbound, a popular obesity drug, from its coverage in favor of Wegovy, despite research indicating that Zepbound results in more weight loss. This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, will force many Americans to switch medications. While CVS Caremark claims the move will lower drug prices for employers, patients and doctors express concern over the reduced ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions to individual needs. This exclusion is part of a growing trend of benefit managers restricting drug coverage, often disrupting treatments and upsetting patients.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, even without a cease-fire, contradicting a plan by European leaders who insisted on a cease-fire first. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy responded cautiously but expressed willingness to meet with Putin in Turkey. The flurry of exchanges occurred after Putin rejected a cease-fire deadline set by European leaders. Trump's support for direct talks aligns with his administration's broader diplomatic ties with Moscow, despite the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece warns against viewing the artificial intelligence (AI) race solely through the lens of competition between the United States and China. The author argues that such a simplistic narrative neglects the agency and interests of other countries, multinational organizations, and corporations. Unbridled AI development carries immense risks, and a binary focus on the US and China could lead to a world where everyone loses. The author urges a more nuanced understanding of AI development that considers the broader global landscape.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced plans to tighten visa rules to address what he calls a 'broken' immigration system. Proposed reforms include stricter English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents, and a longer waiting period of 10 years before migrants can apply for settlement. A 'fast-track' settlement process will be established for skilled workers in high-demand sectors. Critics warn that the new rules may split families and make it harder for migrants to settle in the UK.</p>

          <p>A BBC team documenting the work of an activist protecting Palestinian shepherds in the West Bank had a tense encounter with Moshe Sharvit, an Israeli settler sanctioned by Britain and the EU for violence against Palestinians. Sharvit, who believes the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, confronted the BBC team, accusing them of being dangerous to Israel. The incident highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future held by settlers like Sharvit and activists who advocate for peaceful co-existence with Palestinians.

          <p>A fragile truce between India and Pakistan appeared to be holding after a four-day conflict, with both countries claiming victory. President Trump announced that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with U.S. mediation, but India downplayed the American role, emphasizing direct negotiations with Pakistan. While Pakistan praised the U.S. mediation, India's government sought to avoid any domestic perception that it had stopped fighting under outside pressure. The situation remains uncertain, with concerns about whether the cease-fire will last.</p>
