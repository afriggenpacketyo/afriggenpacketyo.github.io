          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been federally indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors allege she and her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, engaged in a yearslong scheme to defraud the city of over $70,000. The indictment claims Cantrell used public funds to facilitate a personal, intimate relationship with Vappie, paying for his travel on numerous trips and attempting to conceal their communications. Cantrell is the first female mayor in the city's history and is currently term-limited.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after the Chinese embassy lodged complaints about works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, alleges that Chinese officials pressured Thai authorities and the gallery to shut down the exhibit entirely. A compromise was reached where sensitive artworks were removed and artists' names were blacked out. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression, undermining freedom of expression in Thailand.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by producing a simple, customizable pickup truck. The company's basic model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can modify with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. While initially advertised below $20,000 with federal tax credits, the rollback of these incentives may push the price closer to $28,000. This price point puts it in competition with established models like the Ford Maverick, raising questions about its market competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, key Congressional Democrats have voiced doubts that the summit will yield a meaningful resolution to the war in Ukraine. Figures like Senator Mark Warner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed concern that Trump might cede ground to the Russian autocrat without securing Russia's withdrawal or enforceable guarantees for Ukraine's security. Lawmakers are prepared to advance a significant sanctions package against Russia if the talks fail, viewing the moment as a critical test of American resolve against authoritarian aggression.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new terms, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain control of the department, rather than a federally appointed administrator. The agreement followed a lawsuit filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move a 'hostile takeover,' and a federal judge signaling she would likely block the administration's plan. This development marks a significant de-escalation in the power struggle over local governance and policing in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Jamie Raskin, has introduced a joint resolution to end President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. police force. The resolution argues that the president has not demonstrated the 'special conditions of an emergency' required by the D.C. Home Rule Act to justify such a move. Lawmakers contend the action is an egregious attack on D.C.'s autonomy, based on a misleading narrative about crime rates, which have actually declined. The legislative effort represents a formal political and legal challenge to what they describe as a lawless power grab.</p>

The report compared data from 2005 and 2023, finding a sharp decline in the share of young people who have moved out, secured a job, married, and had a child. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, such as rising living costs, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation, with marriage now often viewed as a 'capstone' to be pursued after achieving economic stability.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, citing a need for the company to focus without the distraction of 'intense outside interest.' Her departure follows a pressure campaign from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, after a recent earnings report failed to inspire confidence. The company's stock has been highly volatile, surging after bottoming out near a delisting price earlier this year. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna has been named interim leader while a search for a permanent CEO is underway.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with CEO Ben Kohn describing California as 'anti-business' and an 'extremely expensive place' to operate. The move is part of a growing trend of companies leaving California for states with more favorable business climates, such as Florida and Texas. The media and lifestyle brand plans to establish a new corporate office and a new Playboy Club in Miami Beach. The relocation represents a strategic return to South Florida, where the company had a significant presence in the 1960s and 70s.</p>

          <p>Luke Sung, the former co-owner of Kis Cafe in San Francisco, has spoken out about a viral TikTok video that led to his restaurant's closure and his departure.

Sung claims he questioned if their audiences aligned after viewing her content and that Marcotte threatened 'consequences.' The subsequent online backlash was severe, forcing the cafe to close temporarily before reopening under a new name and different leadership. Sung has since issued an apology for the encounter.</p>
