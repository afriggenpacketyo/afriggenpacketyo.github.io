          <p>New York City police are searching for multiple shooters following a mass shooting inside a crowded Brooklyn lounge that left three people dead and eight others wounded. The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning at the Taste of the City Lounge in Crown Heights and is believed to have stemmed from a dispute. Investigators recovered at least 36 shell casings from what appear to be multiple firearms. While this event is a tragic anomaly in a year with record-low shooting incidents, no arrests have been made as the investigation continues.</p>

He admits to feeling terrified by the pressure of headlining the show but committed to using his 30 years of experience to portray the complex, dual-sided character. Director Ben Stiller praised Scott's technical skill and advocated for him to get the part, a decision that has been vindicated by the show's massive success and numerous accolades.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine will require both Kyiv and Moscow to make significant concessions. Speaking after a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Rubio emphasized that the U.S. is not in a position to accept or reject terms on Ukraine's behalf but is working to narrow the gap between the two sides. He indicated that while progress was made, a final agreement is not imminent, and further details will be discussed with Ukrainian and European leaders at an upcoming White House meeting.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While its maximum winds have decreased, the storm's overall size has expanded, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Forecasters expect the hurricane to remain a powerful and dangerous system, bringing heavy rain and dangerous surf to parts of the Caribbean. Although a direct U.S. landfall is not currently anticipated, its growth could generate hazardous rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze during a Premier League match against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule regarding attacking players in a defensive wall. The International Football Association Board's Law 13, introduced in the 2019-20 season, states that an attacker must remain at least one meter away from a wall of three or more defenders when a free-kick is taken. A Palace player was found to be inside this one-meter zone, leading the referee to nullify the goal and award an indirect free-kick to Chelsea.</p>

Historically, top administrative posts in autonomous regions were often reserved for ethnic minority cadres as a gesture of inclusion. However, these cases suggest that any previous ethnicity-based leniency in elite politics is ending. Observers interpret this as part of a broader push for stricter political discipline across the Communist Party, holding all officials to the same standard regardless of their ethnic background.</p>

Putin conceded nothing, particularly on the key issue of a ceasefire, and instead persuaded President Trump to accept his framework that a comprehensive peace deal must precede any halt in fighting. By keeping diplomatic channels open without making concessions, Putin has potentially neutralized the threat of further U.S. sanctions while simultaneously increasing distrust between Washington and its European allies regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The daughter of renowned 87-year-old Chinese artist Fan Zeng has publicly alleged that he has been "taken away" by his new wife, who is reportedly 50 years his junior. In a social media post, Fan Xiaohui stated that she has lost all contact with her father. Upon returning to his Beijing home from overseas, she found it sealed and empty, with most of his valuable possessions and artworks also missing. The situation has sparked widespread concern for the elderly artist's health, safety, and well-being.</p>

          <h2>Violence Prevention Advocates Criticize Trump's Militarized Approach to Crime</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Community violence prevention leaders argue that the Trump administration's emphasis on militarized law enforcement to combat crime in major cities is misguided and ineffective. They contend that this approach ignores the success of community-based intervention programs, which have been shown to reduce violence by addressing its root causes and working directly with those most at risk. Advocates state that true public safety is built through investment in local infrastructure and programming, not through punitive, response-only tactics that can escalate distrust and fail to create lasting change.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Ghislaine Maxwell, stating they contain no significant new information and would disappoint those seeking bombshells about her confederates. This analysis suggests that while these specific documents are a dead end, a "treasure trove" of other unsealed investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein's sexual-trafficking network likely exists. Critics and victims' advocates argue the Trump administration has the power to release these other files but is choosing not to, fueling public perception of a cover-up.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered a sudden end to a strike by over 10,000 flight attendants that had caused approximately 700 cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board mandated that staff return to work and imposed binding arbitration to resolve the ongoing contract dispute. The flight attendants' union, which is seeking higher wages and pay for ground time, accused the government of violating workers' rights by "caving to corporate pressure" instead of allowing negotiations to proceed.</p>

          <p>China has lodged a strong formal complaint with Japan after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering and several cabinet members visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. The shrine honors convicted Class-A war criminals among Japan's war dead, and the tributes coincided with the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender. Beijing condemned the act as a "blatant provocation against historical justice," urging Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and completely sever ties with militarism.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been completely renovated into a luxury party and event space and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, who purchased the abandoned island in 2017, spent nearly five years and a significant sum overcoming major logistical challenges to make it habitable again. The ambitious project has transformed the historic, off-grid property from a ruin into a unique, modern venue equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink attributes her positive mindset and successful return from a major ACL injury to the practice of creating vision boards. Introduced to the technique by a teammate during her lengthy 13-month rehab, Brink used collages of her goals—such as making the Olympics and being a WNBA All-Star—to stay focused and combat the mental strain of recovery. This visualization practice helped her manage pressure and make an immediate, meaningful impact for her team upon her return to the court this season.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, potentially preventing around 300 Russians and Belarusians fleeing persecution from entering the country, even though many had already received preliminary approval. Activist groups report that the Interior Ministry has halted the issuance of these visas, citing a new government coalition agreement to toughen migration policy. This leaves Kremlin critics, including those targeted for anti-war stances, stranded in neighboring countries where they face a credible risk of abduction or extradition back to Russia.</p>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition government is split over how to expand the Bundeswehr (armed forces) to meet NATO personnel targets. The center-left SPD, led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, has proposed a bill to make voluntary service more attractive with better pay and training. However, members of their center-right CDU/CSU coalition partners criticize the plan as insufficient and too slow, arguing it relies too heavily on volunteers in a tense security climate and are pushing for a faster path toward reinstating compulsory military service.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was dramatically rescued by a helicopter crew after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced rappeller, was pushed off his lines by the "extreme hydraulics" of the Seven Teacups waterfalls on the Kern River. After an extensive two-day search involving aircraft and drones, rescuers located him alive and conscious and successfully hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and only minor injuries before being reunited with his family.</p>
