            <p>The wife of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had filed a protective order against him in 2021 over domestic violence allegations, according to court records. Jennifer Vasquez sought the order, citing incidents of violence, but the case was later dismissed after she failed to appear for a hearing. Despite this, Vasquez maintains her support for her husband and criticizes the Trump administration's handling of his deportation. The Supreme Court has ruled that the administration must facilitate his return to the U.S.</p>
