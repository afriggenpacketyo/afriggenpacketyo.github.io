          <h2>MPs Debate Assisted Dying Bill Amidst Emotional Clashes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament engaged in a heated debate over a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. MPs clashed over the role of doctors, safeguards against coercion, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals. Concerns were raised about pressure on individuals feeling like a burden and the possibility of extending the bill to cover degenerative diseases. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs a free vote on the bill, which has undergone intense scrutiny and amendments since its initial passage. A vote on the bill's future is expected no earlier than June 13.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that a growing number of Americans cannot afford a basic standard of living. The analysis considers costs beyond necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare. The study found that a "minimal quality of life" is unattainable for the bottom 60% of U.S. households, with the functionally unemployed rate topping 24%. The gap between earnings and the cost of living continues to widen, with housing and healthcare costs surging, painting a concerning picture of economic distress despite positive headline indicators.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen, who claim to have accidentally drifted into South Korean waters, remain in limbo as Pyongyang refuses to communicate with Seoul. The men have been in South Korea for over two months, longer than any other reluctant defectors, with no indication of their repatriation. North Korea's silence reflects its displeasure with South Korea's current administration and its designation of the South as a "hostile state." Experts suggest the fishermen may be stuck until relations improve, potentially after South Korea's upcoming presidential election, and are likely concerned about the well-being of their families back home.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund reveals a record number of complaints against U.S. airlines in 2024, driven by flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage.

Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian received the fewest. Nationwide air traffic controller shortages could further exacerbate scheduling issues in 2025.

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, positioned as a "bonus" to help retirees keep more money. This alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits aims to provide tax relief to seniors. The deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. While it would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, experts note that its impact is modest, potentially cutting taxes by less than $500 per year for a median-income retiree.</p>

          <h2>Mike Novogratz Describes Challenges of Taking Galaxy Digital Public</h2>

          <p>Mike Novogratz detailed the arduous four-year, $25 million journey to list Galaxy Digital on the Nasdaq, describing the process as "unfair, infuriating, and un-American." The process stretched to 1,320 days and involved nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than those of traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal strengthened Galaxy, which primarily funded its operations through investment gains and trading. The listing signals a potential return of investor appetite for crypto-adjacent firms after years of caution and volatility.</p>

          <p>Sourcing all auto parts and manufacturing in the U.S. is not feasible due to supply chain complexities and costs. While President Trump pressures automakers to build in the U.S. through tariffs, experts say some parts are cheaper to manufacture overseas. Establishing new plants for materials like steel and semiconductors would take a decade or more. A 100% U.S.-made vehicle could significantly increase costs, pricing many consumers out of the market. Some commoditized parts are currently impossible to source in the U.S., and tracking U.S. content is difficult.</p>

          <p>This article tells the story of Ian, who suffered a severe brain injury in 1986 and was initially diagnosed as being in a vegetative state. Over time, his mother, Eve, refused to give up hope and sought alternative treatments, eventually leading to the discovery that Ian was actually minimally conscious. Modern science has caught up, revealing that many patients previously thought to be vegetative may have covert awareness. The article explores the science of consciousness and the ethical considerations surrounding patients with severe brain injuries, highlighting the importance of recognizing and responding to their potential awareness.</p>

          <p>Tech industry leaders are predicting that artificial general intelligence (AGI), which matches human-level intelligence, is imminent, with some even suggesting "superintelligence" will follow. However, many scientists and AI researchers are skeptical, arguing that current technologies are insufficient to achieve AGI. They point out that today's AI systems primarily predict the next likely word or pixel, differing significantly from human cognition. Claims of AGI's imminent arrival are based on statistical extrapolations and wishful thinking, with no hard evidence that machines can perform tasks like recognizing irony or feeling empathy.</p>
