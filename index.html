          <p>The U.S. military recently struck a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean Sea, resulting in two survivors being rescued and transferred to a Navy ship. This incident marks the sixth such attack since last month and the first known to have survivors, following previous strikes that killed at least 27 individuals. President Trump confirmed the target was a drug-carrying submarine, justifying the actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against cartels. However, some lawmakers and legal scholars question the legality of these strikes and the administration's evidence, raising concerns amid a wider military buildup near Venezuela.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, seeking to overturn a lower court ruling that blocked the move. This action is part of President Trump's broader effort to expand military involvement in Democratic-led cities, citing alleged threats to federal agents and unrest. However, Democratic officials and judges have disputed the administration's portrayal of local conditions, accusing Trump of political motivations and misusing federal authority. The legal challenge centers on the interpretation of a federal statute governing the federalization of the National Guard, underscoring a contentious federal-state dispute over executive power and local governance.</p>

          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old semiconductor company, is experiencing a significant boom due to its specialized active electrical cables (AECs), which are vital for connecting powerful GPUs in AI data centers. These distinctive purple cables, costing $300-$500 each, are favored by hyperscalers like xAI, Amazon, and Microsoft for their reliability over fiber optics. Analysts predict Credo's market, which it largely dominates, will reach $4 billion by 2028, with the company's revenue expected to nearly double again in fiscal 2026. This article highlights Credo's unexpected rise as a key supplier in the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has voluntarily given up his royal titles and honors, including Duke of York, following sustained pressure and exasperation from Buckingham Palace. This dramatic move, while asserting his innocence, comes just before the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, a Jeffrey Epstein victim, is set for release. The article explains that a "tipping point" was reached due to a "constant parade of headlines" and newly published emails contradicting Andrew's previous claims about his ties to Epstein. The decision allows the Royal Family to avoid parliamentary intervention and protect its reputation ahead of upcoming state visits.</p>

While some remain optimistic about solid U.S. growth and lowering borrowing costs, others caution that corrections and bear markets are inevitable, albeit possibly delayed.

This string of bad loans, particularly to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), has raised concerns about hidden risks and potential contagion, drawing comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of more issues, as banks are major funders of these less-regulated non-bank lenders, a category that has seen rapid growth since 2008.

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has offered "everything" to de-escalate tensions with the U.S., using an expletive to threaten him. Trump's comments followed reports of Maduro offering stakes in Venezuela's oil and mineral wealth. This comes amidst ongoing U.S. military strikes on suspected drug vessels near Venezuela, which have killed at least 27 people, with two survivors recently captured. Legal scholars and human rights experts have criticized these strikes as illegal and amounting to "extrajudicial executions," raising serious concerns about international law and the use of military force against alleged criminal groups.</p>

          <p>A collection of renowned artist David Hockney's iPad drawings, titled "The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate," has sold for an impressive £6.2 million at Sotheby's in London. The 17 prints, created starting in 2011 after Hockney relocated to Bridlington, significantly exceeded their estimated value, selling for more than double. This sale represents the largest group of his iPad drawings to come to market, offering an exceptionally rare opportunity for collectors. Hockney turned to the iPad for this series due to the practical challenges of plein air painting in winter, showcasing his innovative approach to art. The works were previously unveiled as part of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2012.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a freeze on an additional $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects in Democratic-led states, citing the ongoing government shutdown. White House budget director Russell Vought stated that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would pause work on "low priority" projects in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Boston, with the possibility of eventual cancellation. This action builds on previous freezes of $28 billion and is seen as President Trump's strategy to pressure political opponents in Congress to end the shutdown. The article highlights the political weaponization of federal funding and its impact on states that voted against Trump.</p>

          <p>Instagram is implementing a new PG-13 rating system for all users under 18, automatically placing them in a filtered version of the app to limit exposure to potentially inappropriate content. This update expands existing "Teen Accounts" features to restrict "certain risky stunts" and "strong language," applying even to 17-year-olds. While Meta aims to reassure parents, content moderation experts express skepticism, questioning the effectiveness and nuance of applying a movie rating system to a dynamic social network.

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a 7% drop, its worst day since January, as some analysts questioned the achievability of its ambitious long-term AI-driven revenue targets.
