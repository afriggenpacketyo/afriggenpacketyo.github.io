          <p>France, the UK, and Germany have formally warned the United Nations that they are prepared to trigger "snapback" sanctions against Iran if it fails to resume diplomatic talks about its nuclear program. This mechanism, part of the original 2015 JCPOA deal, allows for the automatic reimposition of UN sanctions without a veto. The ultimatum follows a recent conflict where U.S. and Israeli forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites, and comes as Iran continues to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade levels, heightening international alarm. Tehran maintains its program is for civilian energy purposes and has not yet agreed to new terms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department's 2024 Human Rights Report has asserted that the human rights situation in Germany has deteriorated, citing restrictions on freedom of expression and an increase in antisemitic violence. The report, however, has faced significant criticism from human rights organizations like Amnesty International, who accuse the Trump administration of altering it to align with political agendas. Critics point to the report's lenient treatment of U.S. allies like Israel and El Salvador while issuing harsh, and allegedly unsubstantiated, critiques of countries like Brazil and South Africa. The German government has acknowledged the report but also defended its commitment to human rights.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the rollout of ten new vans equipped with live facial recognition (LFR) technology to seven police forces across England. This expansion aims to help locate suspects wanted for serious crimes such as homicides and sexual offenses by scanning faces in public and matching them against a watchlist. While the government points to the technology's success in London, leading to 580 arrests in a year, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have condemned the move as an alarming expansion of the surveillance state. The government is simultaneously holding a consultation to establish a new legal framework for the technology's use.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 22 Republican state attorneys general has formally requested that the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA reinstate safety protocols for the abortion drug mifepristone. Citing studies that claim the drug poses significant risks to women, the letter argues for the return of safeguards that were in place as recently as 2011. The attorneys general suggest that if these safety measures cannot be restored, the FDA should consider withdrawing the drug from the market entirely. This move follows a commitment from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to review the latest data on the drug's safety.</p>

          <p>The White House has tempered expectations for the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, describing the meeting as a "listening exercise." Officials stated the goal is for Trump to gain a better understanding of how to potentially end the war in Ukraine, rather than to secure a definitive peace deal. This cautious framing comes amid concerns from Ukraine and European allies that Trump might push for a peace agreement involving territorial concessions from Kyiv, a notion Trump himself has floated. The meeting is set against a backdrop of a renewed Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine, seemingly aimed at strengthening Moscow's negotiating position.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to use its small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy-intensive artificial intelligence data centers could make it the most valuable firm in the UK. Since his takeover in January 2023, the company's share price has increased tenfold, driven by a rebound in its core aircraft engine business and new strategic directions. Despite the SMR technology being currently unproven on a commercial scale, the company has already secured deals with the UK and Czech governments and aims to dominate a market potentially worth over a trillion dollars.

          <p>The Trump administration's annual human rights assessment has accused the United Kingdom of failing to uphold key rights, citing a rise in antisemitic violence and what it terms "serious restrictions" on free speech. The U.S. State Department report specifically pointed to the creation of "safe access zones" around abortion clinics and government interventions to regulate online speech as problematic. The document itself has been criticized for being rewritten and downscaled to spare U.S. allies while escalating disapproval of others, reflecting the administration's political leanings. A UK government spokesperson responded by stating that free speech is vital and that the country is proud to uphold freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to join European leaders for a video conference with U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin. The call is aimed at reinforcing the position that no decisions about Ukraine, particularly regarding its borders, should be made without its involvement. This proactive diplomacy comes as Trump has suggested a peace deal could involve "swapping of territories," raising alarms in Kyiv and European capitals. Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any territorial concessions, stating it could serve as a springboard for future Russian aggression, especially as Moscow's forces advance in the eastern Donbas region.</p>

          <p>An investigation has found that over one in seven councils in the UK have lowered the temperature of their public swimming pools in the last five years, primarily due to soaring energy costs. According to Freedom of Information requests, 15% of responding councils have made these reductions since 2020, a move the Local Government Association attributes to the fragile financial state of councils. While the temperature drops are within official guidelines, critics worry it will deter people from swimming, particularly those with health conditions who rely on warmer water for therapy. One woman with muscular dystrophy stated she had to stop swimming because the colder water exacerbated her condition.</p>

          <h2>California and Trump Administration Clash in Court over Los Angeles Military Deployment</h2>

          <p>Lawyers for California and the federal government are facing off in court over President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles during protests against ICE operations. The state argues the deployment of a "standing army" was an illegal violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, and caused public fear. The Justice Department contends the action was legal and necessary to protect federal property and personnel. The trial is examining whether troops unlawfully detained civilians and restricted movement, setting a precedent as the administration deploys forces to other cities like Washington, D.C.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Susceptibility to Putin's Narrative Poses a Grave Threat to Ukraine</h2>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that the greatest danger from the upcoming Trump-Putin summit is not a bad deal, but President Trump adopting the Kremlin's narrative about the Ukraine war. The author contends that Vladimir Putin aims to manipulate Trump by framing the conflict in a way that aligns with Trump's personal grievances and isolationist views, portraying Ukraine as a corrupt aggressor. If Trump emerges from the meeting echoing Putin's talking points, it could lead him to pressure Kyiv into an unjust and unworkable capitulation under the guise of a personal diplomatic victory. The article suggests that such a psychological win for Putin would be more damaging to Ukraine than continued fighting.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Child Mortality Database reveals that thirteen children under the age of 11 have died after falling from windows in rented or temporary housing in England over a six-year period. The authors describe these deaths as "entirely preventable," highlighting issues such as broken or missing window locks and restrictors, which families had sometimes reported. A separate report from the housing ombudsman likens the scale of window safety defects to problems with damp and mould, urging landlords to address the issue. A pediatric consultant also noted an "unusually high number" of children treated for such falls recently.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks fell to the New York Liberty in a 105-97 loss, a game marked by an injury to Sparks' sophomore star Cameron Brink. Brink tweaked her ankle just before halftime and did not return, a setback for a team already navigating a competitive season. Despite a strong 26-point performance from Kelsey Plum, the Sparks could not overcome the Liberty, who were led by Emma Meesseman's 24 points in the absence of their own star, Breanna Stewart. Coach Lynne Roberts expressed frustration with her team's defensive effort and the officiating, but maintained confidence in her squad moving forward.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications reports that foreign-owned multinational enterprises were responsible for approximately 25% of the total carbon emissions from all companies operating in China over a 20-year period. The research, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, highlights a significant environmental burden associated with foreign investment. It also noted a geographical disparity, with coastal regions reaping more economic benefits while inland areas bore heavier environmental pressures from these operations. The findings raise new questions about assessing carbon emission responsibilities for multinational corporations operating globally.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's surprise announcement of 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has provoked a major identity crisis in Switzerland, a nation long defined by its economic success and political neutrality. The move threatens to devastate sales to the U.S., Switzerland's most important export market, and has left the right-wing government scrambling for a response. The author suggests this "tariff shock" shatters the Swiss feeling of exceptionalism and the belief that it could remain isolated from global political turmoil. The crisis may force Switzerland to reconsider its relationship with the EU, as Brussels appears to be securing a better trade deal with the U.S.</p>

A two-tonne shipment was transported via a cold chain logistics corridor, reaching China's Henan province in just four hours. Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct import into the Chinese market, a development celebrated as part of China's "durian diplomacy." Cambodia produces over 120,000 tonnes of durian annually, and this new air bridge is expected to significantly boost its agricultural exports and economic ties with Beijing.</p>

          <p>In a major collaboration with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel members to the United States to face justice. The group includes prominent figures such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the "Los Cuinis" group allied with the CJNG cartel, and Servando "La Tuta" Gómez Martinez, former head of the Knights Templar cartel. This action represents a significant step in the U.S. Justice Department's efforts to dismantle drug trafficking networks. The transfer follows a similar extradition of 29 cartel figures in February and comes amid ongoing pressure from the U.S. on Mexico to curb the flow of illegal drugs.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made a surprise and unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. In a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Perplexity argued that moving the world's most popular browser to an independent operator would benefit user safety and the open web. However, industry investors have labeled the offer a "stunt," noting the bid is far below Chrome's estimated value and that it is not clear if Google is even considering a sale. The move comes as Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny, with a federal judge expected to rule soon on a case that could potentially order a breakup of its business.</p>

The deployment, which includes 800 troops and 500 federal agents, was met with strong opposition from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called it an "authoritarian push" and denied that crime was rampant. The move has heightened tensions between the federal government and the city's Democratic leadership, with Trump also threatening similar deployments in New York and Chicago.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of science research grants to UCLA that were abruptly frozen late last month. The suspension, affecting over a third of awards totaling $584 million, was deemed by U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin to be a violation of her previous ruling that blocked such terminations. The administration had justified the cuts by citing UCLA's alleged failure to maintain a research environment free of antisemitism. This ruling marks a significant victory for UC researchers in their legal battle against what they argue are politically motivated funding cuts targeting diversity-related programs.</p>

Federal statistics show that nearly half of all migrants detained by ICE in June lacked a criminal record. The article profiles a DACA recipient and father of three U.S. citizens who was detained after a traffic stop and sent to the facility.
