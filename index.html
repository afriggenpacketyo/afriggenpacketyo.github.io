          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer permit the appointment of party members to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," noting that parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK does not. He emphasized his party's significant vote share in the last general election and recent local election successes as justification for this change in the UK's parliamentary structure.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying in the eastern Atlantic and is projected to become the season's first hurricane, with maximum sustained winds approaching the required strength. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will develop into a large and formidable major hurricane as it moves west-northwest. While not an immediate threat to the United States, its path is being closely monitored as it is expected to pass near or north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend, posing a significant risk to the region.</p>

          <p>In a 'Short Wave' podcast episode, developmental biologist Crystal Rogers explores the complex criteria used to define life, moving beyond simple examples like kittens and salt grains. The discussion tackles more challenging cases, such as viruses, which exist on the border of living and non-living entities. Extending the debate to future possibilities, the episode uses a 'Star Trek'-themed scenario to contemplate the potential classification of advanced android robots as living beings, questioning the very boundaries of our biological understanding.</p>

          <p>International talks in Geneva aimed at creating a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution have concluded without a deal. Representatives from 185 countries were unable to resolve a key deadlock over whether the treaty should focus on limiting plastic production or prioritize recycling and waste management. Major oil-producing nations and the plastics industry opposed production caps, while a coalition of other countries argued for stricter controls. The failure marks a significant setback in global environmental efforts, with future negotiations now required to bridge the divide.</p>

This trend of 'bifurcation' is driven by spending pressures that are causing drinkers to either trade up for a treat or trade down to save money. The shift comes as beermakers like Carlsberg, AB InBev, and Heineken face declining sales volumes globally, with at-home consumption also gaining ground over more expensive bar and restaurant sales.</p>

          <p>For those struggling with sleep, particularly during summer heatwaves, several evidence-based strategies can help improve rest. Daily exercise, for instance, increases the production of the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin and reduces stress, leading to longer sleep duration. It is also recommended to avoid caffeine within nine hours of bedtime and reduce screen time before sleeping, as both can disrupt natural sleep cycles. While the popular '4-7-8' breathing method lacks rigorous scientific backing, many find it anecdotally effective for calming the nervous system.</p>

          <p>The federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated Thursday following the discovery of an unknown white powder. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly after the substance was found in five separate letters in the mailroom, and officials stated the situation was brought under control almost immediately. At least two people were exposed to the powder, which is being tested, but authorities have confirmed that no threat remains to the public or employees.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association has issued new guidelines for managing hypertension, recommending that Americans limit both alcohol and sodium intake. The update advises that men should consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women no more than one, as alcohol is shown to increase blood pressure over time. The guidelines continue to stress the importance of lowering sodium consumption to below 2,300 mg daily and encourage adopting heart-healthy diets like the DASH plan to combat hypertension, which affects nearly half of U.S. adults.</p>

          <p>The UK arm of online fast-fashion giant Shein reported a significant 32.3% increase in sales for 2024, reaching £2.05 billion. This strong performance also led to a rise in pre-tax profit to £38.25 million, up from £24.43 million the previous year. The growth comes as the Singapore-headquartered company pursues a public listing, having confidentially filed for an IPO in Hong Kong after facing regulatory delays in London, demonstrating the brand's continued expansion despite economic headwinds and scrutiny.

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta has announced that it successfully thwarted a coup attempt, arresting a group of military officers and civilians allegedly involved in the plot. The government claims the group had support from unspecified foreign states and was attempting to destabilize the country. The arrests, which include two generals and a French national accused of being a foreign agent, occur amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the junta, which seized power in 2020 and has since pivoted away from Western allies toward Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding analysts' forecasts and demonstrating resilience in the face of tariff pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by a strong rebound in exports, which added 0.3 percentage points to GDP, offsetting weaknesses in other areas. Despite the positive result, economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters as investment spending softens and the full impact of U.S. tariffs on key sectors like automobiles is felt.

          <p>Ahead of the Alaska summit, analysis suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin, a seasoned negotiator, will likely try to exploit Donald Trump's perceived weaknesses and desire for a quick resolution. Putin's strategy may involve appearing to make concessions, such as a loose promise for a future meeting with Ukraine's president, to allow Trump to claim a victory. The Russian delegation's inclusion of economic and defense officials also indicates that Putin may tempt Trump with transactional deals on trade or nuclear arms control to secure an agreement favorable to Moscow.</p>

          <p>An Australian man who murdered Emma Lovell, a British woman, during a home invasion in Queensland in 2022 will be eligible for release sooner after a successful appeal. The attacker, who was 17 at the time, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, cutting his minimum time served by 17 months. The Queensland Court of Appeal justified the change by citing the man's early guilty plea, which spared the victim's family a trial, along with his genuine remorse and troubled upbringing.</p>

          <p>President Trump made false claims about crime in Washington D.C. being at its worst point ever while defending the federal takeover of the city's police force. The administration's operation includes the deployment of National Guard troops and the clearing of homeless encampments, a long-standing focus for the president. As part of the takeover, the Attorney General also named the head of the DEA as the city's "emergency police commissioner," a move that D.C.'s mayor and attorney general have challenged as unlawful.</p>
