          <p>The Trump administration is delaying the ban on TikTok for the third time, granting a 90-day extension. This decision follows President Trump's meeting with advisors in the Situation Room after his early departure from a summit with Group of Seven leaders, which was prompted by escalating tensions in the Middle East. Trump's national security team has presented him with various options concerning Iran, including the potential deployment of American military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are revising the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to allocate funds for President Trump's domestic agenda after it was narrowly passed by the House last month. Optimism around international affairs and domestic policy developments could be seen as cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <p>Filing for bankruptcy is a serious decision with long-term consequences, but it can be a lifeline for individuals struggling with overwhelming debt. While there's no official minimum debt threshold, bankruptcy may be worth considering when unsecured debt exceeds half of one's annual income. Other warning signs include relying on minimum payments, borrowing from one card to pay another, and facing calls or lawsuits from debt collectors. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, debt consolidation loans, budgeting, and hardship programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli military chief, Effie Defrin, announced that the third wave of strikes in the ongoing military operation against Iran will target western Iran. According to Defrin, most aerial attacks have been concentrated on Tehran, Iran's capital city, over the past 24 hours. The Israel Air Force aircraft are currently targeting launch and storage sites for surface-to-surface missiles, aiming to prevent operatives from re-accessing and removing munitions from previously struck locations.

          <p>Temperatures in the UK have surpassed 29C, signaling the approach of the first heatwave of the year, with potentially higher temperatures expected through the week. Yellow heat-health alerts are in effect for most of England until Sunday evening, indicating an increased risk to vulnerable populations. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where parts of France and Spain could reach near 40C. A recent study suggests a rapidly increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK, potentially within the next 12 years due to climate change, indicating the growing challenges posed by rising global temperatures.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at their current level, between 4.25% and 4.5%, amid expectations of elevated inflation and moderate economic growth. Despite holding steady, the Fed's "dot plot" indicates that two rate cuts are still anticipated by the end of 2025, though fewer cuts are expected in subsequent years. Economic projections suggest continued stagflationary pressures, with GDP growth forecasted at 1.4% in 2025 and inflation at 3%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's position to await further economic clarity before making any policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates unchanged, maintaining its patient approach amid President Trump's tariff policies.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs could increase prices and hinder economic activity, but stressed the need for more data before adjusting policy. This decision contradicts Trump's calls for lower rates, reflecting the central bank's independence and focus on its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maximizing employment.

          <p>The highly anticipated Nike SKIMS activewear line, a collaboration with Kim Kardashian, will launch later this year instead of in the spring due to production delays. According to sources familiar with the matter, the delays are internal and not related to supplier or shipping issues. No specific date has been set for the new launch, but the relationship between Kardashian and Nike remains strong. The companies are prioritizing the quality and accuracy of the products, leading to the decision to postpone the release.</p>

          <p>Paying off credit card debt can take a considerable amount of time, particularly if only minimum payments are made, which can lead to decades of repayment and significant interest accrual. Accelerating the process requires a strategic approach, whether tackling the debt independently or seeking assistance. Options include debt consolidation loans, balance transfer cards, debt management plans, debt settlement, and bankruptcy. Each strategy offers different timelines and trade-offs, impacting the overall cost and time required to achieve debt freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision upholding a Tennessee ban on gender affirming care for transgender youth has been criticized as an abdication of the judiciary's responsibility to protect minorities. The court's decision, divided along ideological lines, defers to the judgment of the Tennessee Legislature, which is viewed as inappropriate given the historical discrimination faced by transgender individuals. Critics argue that the law discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status, ignoring the medical needs of transgender youth. The decision has sparked concerns about the potential human costs and broader implications for transgender rights.</p>

          <p>Seven men have been charged in what federal prosecutors are calling "the largest jewelry heist in U.S. history," involving approximately $100 million worth of valuables. The suspects allegedly stole gold, diamonds, and luxury watches from an armored semitruck leaving an international jewelry show in July 2022. They followed the truck from the San Francisco area to rest stops near Los Angeles, where they stole 24 bags of merchandise. Authorities have recovered some of the stolen jewelry, and the investigation involved multiple law enforcement agencies.</p>
