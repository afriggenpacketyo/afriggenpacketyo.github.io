          <p>President Trump acknowledged the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, stating that ‚Äúa lot of people are starving‚Äù due to the Israeli blockade. This marks a shift in tone from his previous staunch support of Israel, influenced by discussions with Gulf Arab leaders during his recent Middle East trip. Trump indicated that the U.S. will address the crisis and consider both sides of the issue, signaling a potential change in U.S. policy towards the region. The article highlights the warnings from aid groups about impending famine and the creation of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to provide aid, while also noting skepticism from established humanitarian organizations regarding the distribution system. </p>

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul resulted in an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each. However, the two sides failed to broker a temporary cease-fire, highlighting the deep divisions remaining in the conflict. Russia demanded Ukraine withdraw from the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022, while Ukraine sought a meeting between President Zelensky and President Putin. Despite the lack of major breakthroughs, both sides agreed to share their visions for a cease-fire, with further talks planned, though Zelensky criticized the Istanbul talks as a staged process, and called for increased sanctions against Russia. </p>

This dispute follows a judge's ruling that limited Apple's commissions on in-app purchases, a decision celebrated by Epic Games. Apple claims it requested Epic Sweden to resubmit the update without the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting "Fortnite" in other regions. Epic Games had previously expressed intentions to return "Fortnite" to the App Store if Apple extended the court's commission-free framework globally. </p>

Comey later deleted the image, stating he was unaware of the violent connotations associated with the numbers and opposes violence of any kind.

          <p>Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 this summer, a 12-year high, due to high temperatures and rising electricity prices. This increase is expected to strain household budgets, particularly for low-income families who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy costs. Public assistance programs have not kept pace with the evolving climate, and many states lack protections to prevent utility companies from shutting off electricity for customers behind on payments.
