        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering appealing to the Supreme Court to temporarily suspend a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, particularly if a federal appeals court doesn't issue its own pause on the lower-court ruling. White House officials have criticized the federal trade-court judges, with some accusing them of judicial overreach and being biased against the administration's tariff policies. The court ruling invalidated numerous country-specific tariffs imposed earlier this year under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, asserting that the law doesn't grant presidents such broad authority. The ruling also prevents the administration from making further modifications to the tariffs in question. Optimism regarding global trade is low given the continued back and forth. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strategy of praising and excusing President Putin has not yielded progress in resolving the conflict in Ukraine, leading to growing criticism and questions about whether Trump is being manipulated. Despite Trump's initial claims of leveraging his relationship with Putin to achieve peace, Russia's continued aggression has prompted Trump to express disappointment and consider a different approach. Foreign policy experts and members of Congress are increasingly urging Trump to adopt a tougher stance against Russia, including imposing sanctions. While Trump has hinted at potential sanctions, he has yet to take concrete action, and his administration has dismantled efforts to collect evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The article suggests a cautious outlook on Trump's ability to influence Putin. Optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>England midfielder Ella Toone revealed that she didn't properly grieve after her father's death until a calf injury forced her to take time away from football.

          <p>A massive landslide, triggered by the collapse of the Birch glacier in Switzerland, has largely destroyed the village of Blatten and left one man missing. Authorities had evacuated the village as a precaution, but the scale of destruction was still significant, with approximately 90% of the village destroyed. The landslide has also blocked the River Lonza, raising concerns about potential flooding in the valley below, and authorities have declared a local state of emergency.

          <p>An article in Vox discusses the growing conservative movement to ban lab-grown meat, despite its potential to reduce animal suffering and improve the sustainability of the food system. The author argues that this opposition is driven by paranoia, greed, and cultural grievance, rather than legitimate safety concerns, as lab-grown meat would be subject to FDA scrutiny. The article suggests that conservatives fear the technology could render mass animal torture unnecessary, leading to bans on factory-farmed animal products. While acknowledging the challenges in scaling up lab-grown meat production, the author emphasizes its potential benefits for the environment, animal welfare, and food security.

          <p>The contested primaries for governor in New Jersey are showcasing starkly different perspectives on President Trump's policies, particularly regarding tax breaks and program cuts.

          <p>Representative Steny Hoyer, a longtime Democratic congressman from Maryland, may face a primary challenge from Harry Jarin, who is focusing on Hoyer's age as a central issue in the campaign. Jarin argues that Hoyer, who will be 89 at the end of his next term, is not the best person to represent the district and that new leadership is needed to fight against radical Republicans. Hoyer, who has served in Congress since 1981 and held leadership positions, is the latest high-ranking House Democrat to face a primary challenge from a younger opponent. The primary challenges come as Democrats seek to regroup following recent election setbacks and address concerns that some party members are not vocal enough in opposing President Trump.

While stocks rose internationally, economists point out that Trump could use other legal routes to enact tariffs. The ruling gives the administration 10 days to halt the collection of the tariffs in question, but the administration could quickly replace them with a tariff of up to 15 percent for 150 days using another trade rule. The court's decision does nothing to roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum and on cars or to forestall future tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge will issue an injunction blocking the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to prevent Harvard University from enrolling international students. The university sought to extend a temporary order blocking the administration from revoking the schoolâ€™s right to host international students. Harvard maintains that the administrationâ€™s decision is retaliation for the universityâ€™s refusal to abide by a series of overly broad demands made by the Trump administration that would severely undermine the universityâ€™s independence. The administration had demanded Harvard turn over information about its international students, including discipline records as well as studentâ€™s addresses, contact information and details about their coursework. Optimism score is 70.</p>

Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Josh Hawley have indicated that changes to Medicaid must not harm their states and have drawn a red line on any benefit cuts. The legislation includes new work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients, frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states providing healthcare to undocumented migrants.

The case tested the scope of environmental impact studies that federal agencies must conduct under a U.S. law called the National Environmental Policy Act.
