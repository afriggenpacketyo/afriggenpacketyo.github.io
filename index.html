          <p>Grammy-winning artist Cardi B addressed her reputation for being involved in "drama" in an interview with CBS Mornings. Promoting her upcoming album titled "Am I the Drama?," she explained that her outspoken personality often makes her an easy target for controversy, though she does not enjoy conflict. The Bronx-born rapper acknowledged that this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic," and that some of the stress from public scrutiny is significant.</p>

The short-term continuing resolution includes an additional $30 million for lawmaker security, a response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The bill faces challenges, as Democrats are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, and a small number of Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece for The Guardian, London Mayor Sadiq Khan argues that President Donald Trump has fanned the flames of far-right, divisive politics globally. Khan connects this rhetoric to a recent far-right march in London, urging UK leaders to be a "critical friend" to the U.S. and reject the politics of fear. He asserts that while maintaining a pragmatic relationship with the U.S. is important, it is crucial to speak out against actions like scapegoating minorities and to champion London's values of diversity and openness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House, alleging a coordinated campaign to damage his reputation before the 2024 election. The suit claims that a series of articles and a book, "Lucky Loser," constitute libel and are part of a broader pattern of journalistic corruption by the newspaper. A spokesperson for The New York Times dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and an attempt to stifle independent reporting, vowing the organization would not be intimidated.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine, characterizing it as a policy of "talking tough and doing very little." The article argues that despite initial promises of decisive action, Trump's administration has failed to implement meaningful sanctions against Russia, even after provocations like Russian drones entering Polish airspace. The editorial suggests that Trump's strategy has emboldened Vladimir Putin and undermined European security, using threats against allies as a diversion from confronting Moscow directly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "6-month rule" is a critical component of reverse mortgages, dictating the timeline for heirs after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Once this qualifying event occurs, heirs have six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to satisfy the debt, though extensions may be possible. This rule highlights the importance of estate planning for homeowners with reverse mortgages, as it creates a firm deadline for families to make crucial financial decisions regarding the property to avoid foreclosure.

          <p>A CNBC survey of economists, fund managers, and strategists reveals that a vast majority (82%) believe President Trump's actions are aimed at limiting or eliminating the Federal Reserve's independence. Most respondents predict this pressure will lead to negative economic outcomes, including weaker growth, higher inflation, and increased unemployment. While the Fed is expected to cut rates this week, the survey shows significant disagreement on whether this is the correct policy, reflecting concerns that political interference could destabilize the economy.

          <p>Following the death of actor Robert Redford at age 89, a scathing 2019 editorial he wrote for NBC News is being widely shared online. In the piece, Redford condemned what he called a "dictator-like attack by President Donald Trump on everything this country stands for" and lamented the nation's deep political divisions. The resurgence of the article provides a stark contrast to President Trump's brief comments on Redford's passing, in which he noted the actor was once "the hottest."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions that were placed on Hungarian citizens, citing that Hungary has addressed key security vulnerabilities. The previous administration had imposed limits in 2021 on the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program due to concerns over a simplified naturalization process that granted citizenship to nearly a million people without adequate vetting. The restoration of the standard two-year travel validity is seen as a sign of warming diplomatic relations between Washington and Budapest.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has rejected the petition from Erik and Lyle Menendez for a new trial, ruling that new evidence of sexual abuse by their father would not have changed the original verdict. The brothers, who have been imprisoned for over 35 years for the 1989 murder of their parents, argued that the abuse created a state of fear that justified their actions. However, the judge found that the evidence did not alter the fact that the killings were planned and executed, and would not have resulted in a different outcome or lesser conviction.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. While Mangione will still face nine other state charges, including second-degree murder, the judge ruled that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the terrorism counts. The court found that the targeted killing of one person, though heinous, did not meet the statutory definition of terrorism, which typically involves a desire to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence.</p>
