          <p>A North Carolina landscaper, Michael Brown, has been arrested after allegedly throwing a massive party with hundreds of guests at a former client's home while they were on vacation. Authorities report that Brown, who had previously worked at the Weddington property, charged an entry fee for the unauthorized event. After initially lying to deputies about being the homeowner, he eventually confessed and was charged with multiple offenses, including breaking and entering and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He has since been released on bond.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's sudden termination of two pandemic-era grant programs has left food aid organizations and small farmers in a difficult position. These programs provided about $1 billion for schools and food banks to purchase fresh produce directly from local producers, supporting both community nutrition and agriculture. Nonprofits now face a significant reduction in their ability to serve vulnerable populations in food deserts, while farmers who expanded operations to meet demand are struggling with the loss of a major revenue source. The USDA cited a return to fiscal responsibility for the cuts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session on President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," a massive legislative package that passed the House last month. The bill combines increased spending on border security and defense with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, and is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to advance the bill with a simple majority, while Democrats are forcing numerous amendment votes to highlight controversial provisions. The GOP aims to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

These establishments often leverage unique natural settings to create an "influencer-driven vibe," but some patrons and analysts question the long-term sustainability of this trend. While China's coffee consumption is growing rapidly, the novelty of these rural spots may fade quickly for customers seeking new experiences.

          <p>An analysis from The Motley Fool posits that Nvidia is currently the best stock for exposure to the burgeoning driverless vehicle market, surpassing competitors like Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo. The argument centers on Nvidia's end-to-end AI-powered platform, which includes data center supercomputers for training models and in-vehicle systems that act as the car's brain. Unlike many rivals, Nvidia is already profitable in this space, with its technology being used by nearly every automaker developing autonomous systems.

LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, brings strong three-point shooting to the team, having shot 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.

The policy deems a history of gender dysphoria incompatible with military service, removing previous exceptions and initiating separation proceedings for current personnel. The article follows Maj. Kara Corcoran and Lt. Rae Timberlake, two transgender service members who describe being in "survival mode" as they face involuntary separation or forced retirement. The ban has been criticized as discriminatory and is being challenged legally, while supporters argue it upholds necessary military standards.</p>

          <p>A report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical and logistical issues are the main reasons for falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK, rather than vaccine hesitancy. Experts found that difficulties booking appointments, lack of transport, and insufficient reminders are significant barriers preventing parents from getting their children vaccinated. Vaccine uptake has fallen below the 95% WHO target, leading to recent outbreaks of measles and whooping cough. The commission recommends improving booking systems via NHS apps and expanding vaccination services to address these challenges.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis examines the revolutionary yet divisive approach of US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who aims to tackle America's "epidemic of chronic illness." While his focus on issues like processed foods and additives has gained some support, his tenure is marked by controversy, including promoting unfounded health conspiracies and dismantling parts of the public health apparatus like the CDC. Kennedy has targeted food dyes and backed restrictions on using food stamps for junk food, but also faces criticism for his well-known vaccine skepticism and for firing an expert vaccine advisory committee. His actions present a paradox of addressing neglected health areas while potentially undermining established science.</p>

          <p>Energy bills for approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to fall by 7% starting Tuesday under the new Ofgem price cap. This translates to a reduction of about Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall substantially further and remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels, with future costs for the winter subject to global uncertainty. The regulator is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which are now more widely available and could offer more certainty and potential savings compared to variable tariffs.

Senator Thom Tillis, who announced he will not seek reelection, criticized the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid, arguing they break Trump's pledge to protect the program. The legislation, which makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent while cutting social programs, faces procedural hurdles from the Senate parliamentarian, who has already struck down or required modifications to several key provisions.

Government attorneys countered that the court lacks the authority to second-guess the president's determination of an "invasion" and claimed the gang poses a significant threat.
