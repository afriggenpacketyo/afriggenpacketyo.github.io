          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that Chinese mathematicians have purportedly resolved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem.

          <p>The New York Times analyzes the evolving relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as Trump embarks on a trip to the Middle East. The article notes that the two leaders are increasingly in disagreement on key security issues facing Israel, particularly regarding Iran and the conflict in Gaza. While Trump has largely supported Netanyahu's conduct of the war, he has also begun talks with Iran and reached an agreement with the Houthis in Yemen, actions that have surprised Israeli officials. The article emphasizes that the fate of the region could hinge on how Trump and Netanyahu bridge their differences.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports on the mixed reactions of small businesses to the Trump administration's trade policies. While some welcome the end of a duty-free loophole that benefited Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, others are concerned about the impact of high tariffs on Chinese goods. The article highlights the challenges faced by small businesses in navigating these changes, including the difficulty of rearranging supply chains and the uncertainty surrounding pricing. The article also mentions that Temu has stopped shipping products from China directly to customers in the United States.</p>

          <p>The New York Times examines how Dartmouth College's president, Sian Beilock, is navigating the increasingly polarized political climate in higher education. Unlike many of her peers, Beilock has avoided public criticism of the Trump administration and has focused on promoting free expression and dialogue. This approach has drawn praise from conservatives but criticism from some students and faculty who believe she is trying to placate the administration. The article explores the challenges of balancing academic freedom with the need to address concerns about antisemitism and other issues on campus.</p>

He also suggests that Beijing is negotiating from a position of strength due to the US's dependence on China. The deal includes reduced tariffs on British car and steel exports to the US, while the UK has agreed to remove a tariff on ethanol.</p>
