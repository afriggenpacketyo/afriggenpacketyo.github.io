          <p>China's top diplomat Wang Yi has called on European nations to unite with Beijing against what he describes as Washington's weaponization of tariffs, accusing the US of violating WTO rules and harming global economic interests. In separate discussions with British and Austrian foreign ministers, Wang emphasized China's commitment to upholding international trade rules and fostering mutually beneficial cooperation, positioning China as a responsible nation standing against protectionism. These efforts reflect China's broader strategy to garner international support amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States, particularly in response to President Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to scale back his role in President Trump's administration after Tesla experienced a significant drop in profits and revenue during the first quarter of 2025. The decline is attributed to slumping sales and backlash from Musk's political involvement, including his contribution of over a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election. Musk's reduced involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative aims to refocus his attention on Tesla, which has been impacted by Trump's tariffs on China and changing political sentiment. </p>

          <p>Data from the CDC indicates a 1% increase in US births in 2024, totaling approximately 3.6 million, marking a slight reversal of a long-term decline that began during the Great Recession. However, demographers caution against drawing conclusions about a trend, citing ongoing economic uncertainty, housing costs, and childcare challenges faced by US families. The report also highlights a record-low number of teenage births and an increase in births among women aged 40-44, with Hispanic and Asian women contributing to the rise in birth rates.</p>
