          <p>A recent overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of at least two people, including a one-year-old baby, with eleven others injured. The strikes caused significant damage to several multi-story residential buildings in the Svyatoshynkyi and Darnytskyi districts, leading to fires and partial destruction. Ukrainian officials have condemned the attacks as deliberate targeting of civilian facilities, urging residents to stay in shelters. This assault occurs as Russia's President Putin continues to issue stark warnings to Western nations against providing aid to Ukraine.</p>

The Sunday Telegraph reports on plans to move asylum seekers from hotels to former military bases to address the small boats crisis. The Sunday Times discusses potential overhauls to human rights laws, partly in response to political pressure from Nigel Farage. Meanwhile, the Sunday Express focuses on a report that HMRC has failed to collect £47 billion in taxes from businesses due to unanswered phone calls, a sum that could address public finance shortfalls.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds near 140 mph, is currently moving west across the Pacific Ocean towards Hawaii. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center have warned that swells from the hurricane are expected to reach the Hawaiian Islands by the end of the weekend. These swells could produce life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents, particularly for Maui and the Big Island. In response to the potential threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to prepare for the storm's impact.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer has been convicted of murder and arson for a second time in the 2007 death of her husband, Todd Stermer. Prosecutors argued she set their house on fire and then ran him over with a van as he tried to escape. Her initial life sentence was overturned in 2018 by a federal judge who cited an unfair trial, leading to her release after nearly nine years in prison. However, the Van Buren County Prosecutor's Office refiled the charges, and a new jury once again found her guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, sending her back to prison.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from the U.S. and China has developed a novel method for launching small robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials, which boils nearby water droplets and creates bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects several feet into the air. This innovative technique could have future applications in robotics, allowing for controlled jumping or even swimming on wet surfaces.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report into the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon has found that a connecting cable between the two cabins snapped just before the accident. The report from Portugal's accident investigations bureau noted that the cable had passed a visual inspection on the morning of the incident without any anomalies detected. The crash occurred when the Glória funicular, a historic yellow railway car, derailed and struck a building, killing 16 people and injuring 21. Two separate investigations, one technical and one by the prosecutor's office, are underway to determine the exact cause of the failure.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian military is extensively using a wide array of decoys, from inflatable tanks to flat-pack wooden howitzers, to mislead Russian forces and deplete their resources. These realistic mock-ups are designed to draw fire from expensive Russian munitions, such as Lancet drones, onto worthless targets. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in producing these decoys, which can be quickly assembled on the front lines to mimic real military positions. This strategy of deception is a key element of Ukraine's defense, forcing Russia to waste time, effort, and valuable ammunition on fake equipment.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document Catholic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican has attributed two miracles to his intercession, fulfilling the requirements for sainthood. His canonization is seen by some as an effort by the Church to connect with younger generations, celebrating a modern figure who enjoyed video games and wore jeans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team suffered a disappointing 2-0 defeat to South Korea in a friendly match, continuing a period of lackluster results as the World Cup approaches. Playing in front of a largely pro-Korean crowd in New Jersey, the USMNT struggled with defensive communication and failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities. South Korea's Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, highlighting gaps in the American defense. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino defended the team's experimental phase, stating that the focus is on being ready for the World Cup rather than immediate results.</p>

          <p>As Dame Anna Wintour transitions from editor-in-chief of US Vogue to a global editorial director role, the iconic fashion magazine faces a critical juncture. For nearly four decades, Wintour defined Vogue's cultural influence, famously merging high fashion with mainstream celebrity culture by featuring figures like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits a brand that must now compete in a fast-paced digital landscape dominated by social media. The transition raises questions about whether Vogue can maintain its status as a premier arbiter of style without Wintour's singular vision at the helm.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by more than 80% after the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. According to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the change, which took effect in late August, requires duties to be collected on parcels valued under $800 that were previously exempt. The new rule has caused major operational disruptions, as many foreign postal operators and carriers are not equipped to handle the customs collection process. Consequently, 88 postal operators have suspended some or all services to the U.S., leading to a near-halt in incoming international mail. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. On their first entry under the new system, travelers, including those from the UK, will need to register biometric data, such as fingerprints and a facial image, at automated kiosks or with border officers. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, officials have expressed concerns about potential for long queues and delays during the initial registration phase.</p>

          <p>Singapore is confronting an existential threat from rising sea levels, which are projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100 and potentially up to 5 meters during storm surges. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has described the situation as a "life and death matter," emphasizing the nation's vulnerability as a low-lying island. With critical infrastructure like airports and power plants located along its coasts, Singapore is investing billions in coastal defenses, including seawalls and land reclamation. The issue highlights the severe impact of global warming on small island nations, forcing them to take drastic measures to ensure their survival.</p>
