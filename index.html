          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second in its history for the region. High winds, reaching 60 to 70 mph, lifted dust from dry farmlands, creating a thick haze that significantly reduced visibility, especially on major interstates. The storm caused ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports and led to reports of "mud rain" in some areas where showers coincided with the dust. While the dust storm has subsided, cooler and drier weather is expected for the weekend, with a rainy pattern returning next week.</p>

During her testimony, Ventura shared graphic details about her decade-long relationship with Combs and the physical violence she allegedly endured. Combs' lawyers attempted to portray Ventura as an eager participant in the sexual lifestyle, but she maintained that she was coerced into the sessions due to threats of violence. She stated that she would trade the money for a life free of the "freak offs", which she said caused her physical injuries and stifled her career as a singer.</p>

The audio captures Biden struggling to remember the year he left office as vice president and the date of his son Beau's death, adding context to the written transcripts released earlier.

          <p>Angels Flight Railway in downtown Los Angeles is increasing fares from $1.00 to $1.50, citing rising costs of insurance, maintenance, and labor. This is the first price increase since 2017, and officials do not anticipate another being necessary in the near future. The iconic funicular railway, a living piece of Los Angeles history, has faced maintenance and safety challenges over the years. The fare change will allow the Angels Flight Railway Foundation to continue serving the community while maintaining the railway's safety and heritage.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Democratic Party's initial reluctance to acknowledge Joe Biden's declining health and cognitive abilities, highlighting the party's tendency towards groupthink and risk aversion. She argues that many Democrats were lying to themselves about Biden's fitness for office, and that the party must now confront its missteps in order to rebuild trust. While some blame Biden's inner circle for covering up the extent of his deterioration, Goldberg suggests that the problem was more widespread, with many Democrats trapped in a bubble and unable to recognize how weak Biden appeared to the public.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, called the story "grossly out of context" and stated that FEMA is "fully activated" in preparation for hurricane season.

          <p>Teachers at Westbourne Academy in Ipswich are on strike due to concerns over pupil behaviour, including incidents of chairs and scissors being thrown at them. Teachers have described a lack of support from senior leadership, with some students disrupting classes and exams. The trust that runs the school acknowledges that a minority of pupils' behaviour does not meet expectations and says it is actively addressing the issue. The strike highlights the challenges schools face in managing pupil behaviour and the impact on teachers' well-being.</p>
