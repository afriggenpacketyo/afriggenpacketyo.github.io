        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has decided to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a significant change in British foreign policy. This decision was driven by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as domestic political pressure from within the Labour Party and international moves by other G7 nations. While the government argues the move is a necessary step to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, critics, including the Israeli government, have condemned it as a symbolic gesture that rewards terrorism. The policy shift also creates a point of disagreement with the United States.</p>

          <p>Political pressure from the Trump administration led to the resignation of the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, after he reportedly declined to prosecute New York AG Letitia James. President Trump confirmed he fired Siebert over concerns about his Democratic support. Mary "Maggie" Cleary, a conservative lawyer who previously wrote about being politically targeted, has been named as the replacement, taking over an office in a state of upheaval. The move highlights ongoing tensions between the White House and the Justice Department over politically sensitive investigations.</p>

Police reported that the building was struck by at least three rounds, causing property damage but resulting in no injuries. The suspect, identified as Anibal Hernandezsantana, was apprehended after police traced the vehicle involved. The motive for the attack on the media outlet remains under investigation, and the incident has drawn condemnation from public officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, as an assault on democracy.</p>

          <p>Two Republican state senators in Oklahoma have introduced a bill that would compel every public university in the state to build a memorial plaza featuring a statue of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The legislation mandates that Kirk be described as a "modern civil rights leader" and imposes significant monthly fines on institutions that fail to comply. This proposal is part of a broader conservative effort to frame Kirk as a political martyr, a comparison that has drawn criticism, including from the family of Martin Luther King Jr., who noted Kirk's divisive rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including senior CIA officials, without prior notification to the White House. This action caused significant internal frustration, as it prevented the administration from vetting the list, which included career intelligence officers and Democratic congressional staffers. An intelligence official claimed the move was in line with President Trump's directive to remove officials involved in the 2016 Russia intelligence assessments. The episode has reportedly worsened the already tense relationship between Gabbard's office and the CIA.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is gaining strength over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will intensify into a hurricane over the weekend. The storm is currently projected to remain over open water, passing near Bermuda early next week without making direct landfall. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada, creating potentially dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a threat to Afghanistan, stating that "bad things are going to happen" if the country does not return control of the Bagram air base to the United States. The base, a key strategic hub for U.S. forces for two decades, was taken over by the Taliban following the American withdrawal in 2021. Trump's demand comes amid his administration's efforts to re-establish a U.S. presence in the region. Afghan officials have publicly opposed the idea, emphasizing the need for engagement without a U.S. military footprint on their soil.</p>

          <p>California has become the first state to ban law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identities while on duty. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the "No Secret Police Act" in response to recent immigration raids where federal ICE agents were seen wearing masks. The law includes exceptions for tactical operations or medical needs but is intended to increase transparency and accountability. While proponents see it as a check on federal overreach, the law's enforceability on federal agents is legally uncertain and has been criticized by law enforcement groups.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, has sparked controversy by comparing the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk to a "modern-day St. Paul" during a television appearance. Dolan described Kirk as a "missionary" and an "evangelist," suggesting his death could inspire faith among young people. The remarks drew a mixed reaction, with significant public backlash on social media from critics who pointed to Kirk's divisive rhetoric and Dolan's own controversial history, including his handling of clergy sexual assault cases.

          <p>Researchers have made a significant discovery by observing diamond capsules undergo "shock-induced amorphization" for the first time when subjected to powerful lasers. This process, where the diamond's atomic structure collapses under extreme pressure, provides critical insights for developing nuclear fusion energy. By understanding how to control this structural change, scientists can better manage the symmetrical implosion needed to generate fusion power. The breakthrough could advance the quest for a clean, nearly limitless energy source, which would reduce dependence on fossil fuels and their harmful environmental effects.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrats Aim to Reclaim Patriotism from the Far Right at Party Conference</h2>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is making a concerted effort to embrace patriotism, a theme prominently featured at its annual conference in Bournemouth. In a theatrical speech, former leader Tim Farron draped himself in a flag and urged members to "reclaim patriotism" and the country's flags from nationalist groups that seek to divide society. This new strategy aims to counter the narrative of parties like Reform UK and position the Lib Dems as the true patriots who represent British values of tolerance and unity. The move marks a notable shift for the party, which has traditionally shied away from such displays.</p>

          <h2>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione Seek to Block Death Penalty in Federal Case</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that public statements from officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for capital punishment, have prejudiced the case and violated his right to a fair trial. The defense also criticized the highly public nature of his arrest as a spectacle designed to taint the jury pool. This legal challenge comes after a state judge dismissed terrorism charges against Mangione, though he still faces murder charges.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting software from Collins Aerospace has caused significant flight delays and disruptions at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The affected "Muse" software is used by multiple airlines for electronic check-in and baggage handling, forcing airports to revert to manual processes. The software's owner, RTX, confirmed a "cyber-related disruption" and is working to resolve the issue. While the impact is limited to check-in systems, the incident has led to long queues and hundreds of delayed flights, highlighting the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon, now renamed the Department of War under the Trump administration, has issued new rules that significantly restrict reporters' access and ability to use unnamed sources. According to a new memo, journalists must sign a document agreeing not to publish classified or "controlled unclassified information" without official approval. This effectively prevents reporting based on anonymous military sources, with the threat of losing press credentials for non-compliance. The National Press Club has condemned the move as a "direct assault on independent journalism," arguing it prevents the public from receiving anything other than government-approved information.</p>

          <p>A right-wing, anti-immigration protest in The Hague, Netherlands, descended into violence just weeks before the country's general election. Rioters clashed with police, throwing objects and setting a police car on fire, prompting officers to use tear gas and water cannons. The office of a centrist political party was also vandalized during the unrest. Political leaders, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof, condemned the violence as "completely unacceptable." The demonstration highlights rising political tensions over immigration, a key issue in the upcoming election.</p>

They argue that the prison is cost-effective, has available space, and offers valuable rehabilitation programs, making it a viable solution for overcrowding in county jails. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation cited the facility's aging infrastructure and the suitability of its inmate population for relocation as reasons for the closure. The officers' campaign highlights the ongoing debate over prison capacity in California.</p>

          <p>The government of India has officially responded to the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas, stating the policy will have significant "humanitarian consequences."

The statement comes amid existing trade tensions and calls on U.S. authorities to address the potential disruptions. The policy has created widespread uncertainty for Indian professionals.
