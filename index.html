          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly stated that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is jeopardizing the health of Americans. In a New York Times op-ed, the bipartisan group, whose tenures span from the Carter to the Trump administrations, condemned the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez. They argue that Secretary Kennedy's actions, including dismantling vaccine advisory committees and promoting unproven treatments, represent a significant threat to the nation's public health infrastructure. The former directors are calling on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over HHS to address what they describe as an alarming situation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has urged pharmaceutical companies to publicly justify the effectiveness of their COVID-19 drugs, citing conflicting public opinions on their success. His demand comes shortly after the FDA limited new vaccine approvals to high-risk individuals and follows significant leadership upheaval at the CDC, including the firing of its director. Trump referenced his administration's Operation Warp Speed while questioning why companies like Pfizer have not been more transparent with their data. He stated that greater transparency is needed to resolve the public debate and ongoing turmoil surrounding vaccine policy at federal health agencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has fallen by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year, reflecting the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies. This decline is affecting key sectors like agriculture, construction, and services, which are heavily reliant on immigrant labor. Economists express concern that the slowdown in immigration could exacerbate labor shortages and complicate economic analysis, as immigrants are crucial for filling jobs and supporting growth.

          <p>Authorities in Pershing County, Nevada, are conducting a homicide investigation after a man was discovered deceased at the Burning Man festival. The victim, described as a white adult male, was found in a pool of blood on Saturday evening as the event's signature effigy burning was beginning. Law enforcement has cordoned off the area and is interviewing festival attendees, though no suspects or cause of death have been identified yet. Organizers of the annual arts and music event, which concludes Monday, have stated they are fully cooperating with the investigation and have urged participants to remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS signal disruption, suspected to be an act of Russian interference, as it approached Bulgaria. While the aircraft landed safely, the incident has heightened concerns about Russia's use of electronic warfare tactics. An EU spokesperson called the event a component of Russia's hostile actions and affirmed it would strengthen the bloc's resolve to enhance its defense capabilities and support for Ukraine. This event is part of a rising trend of GPS jamming and spoofing incidents reported by aircraft operating near Russian territory, prompting aviation safety agencies to address the growing risk.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. tariff policies on Chinese goods are creating uncertainty in the shipping industry, potentially leading to a significant slowdown in freight volume for the latter half of 2025. An analysis of freight market data, including the Outbound Tender Volume Index (OTVI) and Inbound Ocean TEUs Volume Index (IOTI), shows flat or declining demand for shipping. This trend disproportionately affects small carriers and owner-operators, who rely heavily on the spot market and have thinner margins. The article warns that if tariffs continue to escalate, the crucial fourth-quarter peak season could be one of the weakest in years, placing many small trucking businesses at financial risk.

In contrast, domesticated species such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for agricultural purposes. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world over the last millennium.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have arrested a suspect in the assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a former speaker of parliament, and claim there is a "Russian trace" in the crime. Parubiy, a key figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements, was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Police stated the suspect, disguised as a food delivery courier, shot Parubiy multiple times in a carefully planned attack. The killing of the pro-Western politician has heightened tensions, with Ukrainian officials suggesting Russian involvement, a common accusation from both sides since the 2022 invasion began.</p>

Investors will closely watch several upcoming jobs reports, including Friday's nonfarm payroll data, for signs of further cooling that could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts. Additionally, earnings from Salesforce and fellow chipmaker Broadcom will provide further insight into the strength of the enterprise software and AI hardware sectors. The market will also be digesting a recent appeals court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, highlighting their countries' deepening partnership. The meeting is significant as it occurs while India faces economic pressure from the U.S. over its continued purchases of Russian oil. Both leaders described their nations' relationship as special and privileged, with plans for Putin to visit India for a formal summit later in the year. This demonstration of unity between India, Russia, and host country China is viewed by analysts as a strategic move to counter U.S. economic unilateralism.</p>

          <p>In its UK financial report, denim giant Levi's has identified rising anti-Americanism, linked to the Trump administration's tariff policies, as a key risk that could negatively impact its sales. The company fears that changing consumer sentiment could lead shoppers in the UK to favor national or European brands over American ones like Levi's. This warning, filed in its official accounts, is one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly expressing concern about the potential commercial fallout from current American governmental policies. Despite the risk, the company reported strong sales and profit growth in the UK for the period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the publicly-owned railway operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making travel during traditional commuter hours significantly cheaper. The move is intended to encourage more passengers to use the rail system, as post-pandemic travel patterns have left more capacity on trains during rush hour. This initiative has sparked a debate about whether England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could adopt a similar model to simplify ticketing and reduce costs for passengers. However, experts are divided, with some warning that without government investment to increase capacity, it could lead to overcrowding on busy routes or higher overall ticket prices.</p>

          <p>The trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under threat after President Donald Trump warned of new tariffs in response to the EU's digital services taxes and technology regulations. Trump argues that EU rules, such as the Digital Services Act, unfairly target American tech giants and has demanded they be scrapped. EU officials were caught off guard by the threat, which undermines a recent deal to cap transatlantic tariffs. This renewed dispute places Brussels in a difficult position, as it seeks to maintain its sovereign right to regulate its markets while avoiding a damaging trade war with a key ally.

          <p>David Warburton, who served as the Member of Parliament for Somerton and Frome until 2023, has died suddenly at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police confirmed he was found deceased at a residence in London, and his death is being treated as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton was suspended from the Conservative Party in 2022 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and which were later withdrawn. He ultimately resigned his seat after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election. Colleagues remembered him as a talented and passionate defender of his constituents.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by using national emergency declarations to impose widespread tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The decision largely upholds a lower court's finding but has delayed the immediate removal of the tariffs to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This ruling represents a significant legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy. The case centers on whether the President can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to bypass Congress, which constitutionally holds the power to set taxes and tariffs.</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has resulted in a significant death toll, with challenges in rescue and reporting due to the region's remote, mountainous terrain. The quake's shallow depth amplified its destructive power, causing landslides that have blocked access to the worst-hit areas and destroying homes made of mud and timber. The country's ability to respond is severely constrained by its economic collapse following the Taliban takeover, the suspension of most foreign aid, and a crippled healthcare system. The situation is particularly dire for women and girls, whose access to life-saving services is limited by Taliban restrictions.</p>

Known for his durability and technical skill, Bugner famously fought some of the sport's greatest legends, including two bouts against Muhammad Ali and one against Joe Frazier. Throughout the 1970s, he was consistently ranked among the world's top heavyweights and also shared the ring with Henry Cooper and Frank Bruno. Born in Hungary, Bugner fled to the UK after the 1956 Soviet invasion and went on to have an 83-fight professional career before retiring and later appearing in films.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has reportedly implemented a near-total suspension of non-immigrant visas for individuals holding Palestinian Authority passports, according to media reports citing a diplomatic cable. This policy would affect Palestinians from the West Bank and diaspora seeking to travel to the U.S. for business, study, or medical care. The State Department did not explicitly confirm the move but stated it was acting in compliance with U.S. law and national security. This development follows a recent pause on visitor visas for residents of Gaza and the denial of visas to dozens of Palestinian officials, signaling a significant tightening of U.S. policy.</p>
