            <p>Cody Balmer, a 38-year-old Pennsylvania man, faces charges including attempted murder and terrorism after allegedly setting a fire at Governor Josh Shapiro's residence in Harrisburg. The incident forced Shapiro and his family to evacuate early Sunday morning. Balmer reportedly hopped a fence and intentionally started the fire while the family was asleep. Balmer's mother stated her son is mentally ill and had gone off his medication. No one was injured, but the fire caused significant damage and is under investigation by the Pennsylvania State Police and the FBI.</p>

            <p>South Korea is investing 33 trillion won ($23.25 billion) to bolster its semiconductor industry amid uncertainty surrounding potential U.S. tariffs on imported semiconductors. This support package includes subsidies for underground power transmission lines, increased funding for infrastructure in advanced industrial complexes, and low-interest loans for semiconductor companies. The U.S. Department of Commerce is also initiating an investigation into the national security implications of semiconductor imports, signaling potential trade measures.

Analysts suggest that antitrust concerns could hinder a Shell-BP deal, while Chevron's pursuit of Hess could influence its interest in BP.

            <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Mechanism Behind Breast Cancer Aggressiveness</h2>

            <p>A Chinese research team has discovered a key mechanism by which breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and multiply. The study reveals that metabolic communication between cancer cells and macrophages plays a significant role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. These findings could pave the way for new precision therapies that target arginine metabolism, potentially starving tumors of this essential building block for protein. This research offers a new avenue for treating the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing approximately $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard University after the institution rejected demands to crack down on antisemitism and alleged civil rights violations.

Harvard's president stated the university would not comply with demands that threatened academic freedom and university self-governance.

            <p>Senior advisors close to President Trump privately warned weeks ago that some tariff proposals could have devastating effects on global financial markets and the U.S. economy. Internal disagreements over the tariff effort manifested well before the public announcement. Heated debates occurred between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and trade advisor Peter Navarro, with Bessent cautioning against broad tariffs due to potential market turmoil. Despite these warnings, the administration initially proceeded with the tariffs, leading to significant market instability before partially reversing course.</p>
