          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to arm certain clans in Gaza to combat Hamas has drawn criticism from opposition figures, who fear it could destabilize the region. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman likened the armed groups to ISIS and expressed concern that weapons provided by Israel could eventually be used against Israeli forces. Netanyahu defended the move, stating that it was done on the advice of security officials to save the lives of IDF soldiers. Hamas condemned the action, viewing anyone involved with these groups as Israeli soldiers, while opposition leader Yair Lapid warned of repeating past mistakes of supporting Hamas. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow mass layoffs at the Department of Education to proceed, despite ongoing legal challenges. The Justice Department is seeking to overturn a lower court's ruling that blocked the administration from laying off over 1,000 employees as part of its efforts to dismantle the department. The administration argues that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to interfere with the Executive Branch's management decisions. This action is part of President Trump's broader plan to reorganize the Department of Education, transferring some of its functions to other agencies. </p>

          <p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation has enlisted prominent lawyers, including Abbe David Lowell and Norm Eisen, to challenge Paramount Global's potential settlement with President Trump over a $20 billion lawsuit. The lawyers argue that settling with Trump to expedite the sale of Paramount to Skydance Media would severely damage the company's credibility and shareholder value. They suggest that such a settlement could violate anti-bribery statutes, potentially leading to legal repercussions for Paramount's board members. This action follows warnings from senators and a proposed California Senate hearing to investigate the implications of the settlement on journalistic integrity. </p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for fire coverage, faces scrutiny for its lack of transparency, especially as ratepayers now cover its debts. Unlike other insurers, the FAIR Plan doesn't publicly disclose financial data or hold open board meetings, raising concerns about accountability. Recent rule changes mean that property insurance holders are now responsible for covering the FAIR Plan's financial shortfalls. Critics argue that the plan's secrecy hinders proper oversight, especially given its growing role in providing fire insurance across the state. </p>

Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that the bill aims to cut taxes, secure the border, and reform welfare, without incorporating any pork-barrel spending.

          <p>The absence of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio from the preparations for a phone call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has sparked questions about his influence in shaping US-China relations. The call, which Trump described as "very positive," led to the announcement that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other officials would lead future trade negotiations. This shift in approach, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's deal-making preference, suggests a diminished role for Rubio, who has been a vocal critic of China. Observers note that past engagements between US and Chinese leaders typically involved top diplomats like the Secretary of State. </p>

The policy is viewed as alienating and counterproductive, with limited evidence to support its claims of addressing national security concerns.
