          <p>Oil prices surged following reported U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating tensions in the Middle East and raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. Experts warn of unprecedented supply disruptions, potentially exceeding the 2022 Ukraine war shock, with the Strait of Hormuz becoming a focal point. The Strait, a vital artery for global oil trade, could see prices retest 2022 highs near $100 per barrel if Iran blocks it, leading to potential Western military intervention. A prolonged closure or attacks on Gulf energy infrastructure could further exacerbate price spikes, signaling a new era of volatility in oil markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution.

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships identifies five phrases that hinder children's cooperation and offers alternative communication strategies. These strategies include explaining reasoning instead of demanding obedience, offering agency within boundaries, validating emotions, inviting problem-solving, and encouraging self-reflection. The research suggests that creating a respectful and emotionally safe environment fosters cooperation and raises emotionally resilient children. The approach emphasizes partnership and understanding over control and criticism.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported for suspected cyberstalking offences, prompting concerns about the normalisation of online monitoring. Experts believe that constant digital surveillance, often seen as a sign of love and care, can lead to concerning behaviours. Charities emphasize the need to educate young people about healthy relationships in the digital age. The government has introduced guidance allowing victims to learn their stalker's identity quickly and has expanded the use of Stalking Protection Orders.</p>
