          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Ax-4 mission, a privately-funded flight to the International Space Station (ISS), carrying retired astronaut Peggy Whitson and three rookie crewmates from India, Poland, and Hungary. The mission, which experienced delays due to weather and technical issues, marks Axiom Space's fourth commercial flight to the ISS. Whitson, a veteran of three NASA flights, will oversee scientific research and technology demonstrations during the two-week mission, while also engaging in educational outreach. The mission aims to provide access to space for countries that may not normally have it, highlighting the growing commercialization of space travel. The launch was smooth and the crew is expected to dock with the ISS after a 28-hour rendezvous. Optimism is present as the mission is a collaboration between multiple countries. </p>

          <p>Tony Moon, a participant in the "rooftop Korean" movement during the 1992 Rodney King riots, contrasts the organic nature of those events with what he perceives as manufactured unrest today. Moon, who armed himself to protect local businesses during the King riots, believes current riots in Los Angeles are politically motivated and lack genuine grassroots support. He advocates for peaceful protest but advises Angelenos to arm themselves for self-defense in the face of violent crime. Moon's comments come amidst recent clashes between federal law enforcement and protestors in Los Angeles, with the mayor blaming President Trump for deploying federal troops.

          <p>Chinese military analysts have been closely observing the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian facilities, focusing on the use of the GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs. While acknowledging the effectiveness of the B-2 bomber's delivery and the bomb's performance, they also highlight the limitations against deeply buried targets like Fordow. China, known for its extensive underground bunker systems, is developing its own bunker-busting weapons, particularly for potential targets within Taiwan. The analysts' assessment provides insight into China's strategic thinking regarding its own military capabilities. </p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are opposing the government's planned welfare reforms, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Despite appeals from ministers, over 130 MPs, including 122 from Labour, have signed an amendment to block the changes. While Labour leader Keir Starmer intends to proceed with the reforms, the widespread opposition reflects concerns about the impact on vulnerable individuals. Some cabinet members are fearful that the mood on this issue might bleed into a broader problem for the Labour leadership. </p>

          <p>The UK government feared that contacting victims of the Post Office scandal who hadn't sought compensation might be perceived as harassment, according to MPs on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The PAC found that many wrongly accused sub-postmasters are yet to receive fair redress, and the government has taken insufficient action to ensure they apply. While the government has paid out over £1 billion in compensation, just one in five letters sent to sub-postmasters about restitution received a response. The PAC has recommended that every postmaster be made fully aware of their compensation options. </p>

          <p>India is celebrating the successful launch of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission, which includes Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, making him the second Indian to travel to space after 41 years. Group Captain Shukla will be the first Indian to visit NASA's orbiting laboratory, the ISS. The mission, a collaboration between NASA, India's space agency ISRO, and the European Space Agency (ESA), has generated significant interest in India. Group Captain Shukla's experience on the ISS will contribute to India's ambitious space plans, including setting up a space station by 2035 and sending an astronaut to the Moon by 2040. </p>

Discussions at the NATO summit in The Hague are also expected to address tensions between Israel and Iran, amidst a fragile ceasefire.
