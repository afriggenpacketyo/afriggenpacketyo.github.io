          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling, preventing the state from using public funds for a Catholic charter school.

The ruling, however, doesn't set a nationwide precedent, leaving open the possibility of future challenges.

          <p>South Africa's Expropriation Act, which allows the government to seize private property for public use with fair compensation, has ignited international debate, particularly after US President Donald Trump's intervention. The law aims to address historical land ownership disparities resulting from apartheid. While the government insists it will only seize unused land with compensation, concerns remain about potential impacts on property rights. Trump's administration issued an executive order stating the law enables the South African government "to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation," leading to offers of refugee status in the US for white Afrikaner farmers. </p>

          <p>The Atlantic reviews the latest installment of the Final Destination franchise, "Final Destination: Bloodlines." This review speaks to the new Final Destination film's soupÃ§on of self-awareness, and the movie's ability to have the viewer scream and giggle at the same time. The article describes the premise of the movie, which involves a Space Needle-esque building that both collapses and explodes, and the well-established stakes that help the story speed through the most boring parts of the Final Destination schematic. The reviewer notes that it is fun to have a horror movie you can cheer during, and that the movie knows how to enjoy itself. </p>
