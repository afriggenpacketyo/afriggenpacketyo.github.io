          <p>A new legislative measure capping federal student loans is raising concerns about the financial viability of medical school for many students. The lifetime loan limit for professional programs like medicine is now set at $200,000, a figure below the average cost of a medical degree. The American Medical Association warns this could act as a "punch in the face" for aspiring doctors, potentially worsening a projected physician shortage by disproportionately affecting students from lower-income backgrounds. Experts note this may shift more borrowing to private lenders, which offer fewer protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Business leaders, particularly in Europe, are struggling to navigate the complexities of a new U.S. tariff regime implemented by the Trump administration. With new baseline tariffs and higher rates on specific partners, CEOs have expressed a need for more clarity and certainty to make investment decisions. Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco described himself as "confused" by the announcements, while the head of shipping giant Maersk noted the uncertainty is causing delays in global investments. The new tariff rates are reportedly the highest since 1935, creating a challenging and unpredictable market environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics noted that the episode felt awkward and that jokes between the hosts appeared to have been edited out.

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has raised its full-year financial guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. The company, a key indicator of global trade, cited a manufacturing boom in China and robust export growth worldwide as drivers of demand. However, CEO Vincent Clerc specifically noted that the United States is an exception to this trend, attributing a dampening effect on demand to the "tariff-on, tariff-off" environment. The company now expects global container market volume to grow between 2% and 4%, an upward revision from its previous forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing criticism following allegations that she increased the rent on a property she owns by £700 a month. The increase reportedly occurred shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended and they were given four months' notice to leave. A source close to the minister stated she complied with all legal requirements and that the tenants chose to leave. However, the situation has drawn condemnation from renter advocacy groups and political opponents, who have called for her resignation amid the perceived hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>This article explores the motivations of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted for her central role in facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. It posits that her actions stemmed from a deep-seated desire for the attention and approval of powerful men, a pattern established with her father, Robert Maxwell. After her father's death and a subsequent family scandal, her devotion to Epstein intensified, leading her to recruit and groom victims for his sexual assaults. The analysis suggests that Maxwell's loyalty, which may now be leveraged for a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, reflects a profound moral vacancy.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is peaking in Southern California, bringing triple-digit temperatures to inland valleys and elevating the risk of wildfires. While a slight cooling is expected over the weekend, temperatures will remain above normal into the next week. The National Weather Service has issued heat advisories for the Inland Empire and parts of San Diego County. The sustained hot and dry conditions are worsening the threat of wildfires, with an air quality advisory already in place due to several active blazes in the region.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Push in Congress Aims to Simplify Veterans' Access to Private Healthcare</h2>

          <p>Congress is considering legislation to make it easier for military veterans to use their VA benefits for healthcare at private, non-VA facilities. The proposals, led by Republicans, would build on existing community care programs, particularly for rural veterans who live far from VA hospitals. Supporters argue it provides necessary convenience and choice, while critics and some veterans' groups worry that shifting funds to private care could weaken the VA's specialized system. The debate centers on balancing accessibility for veterans with the need to maintain the integrity and funding of VA-run hospitals and clinics.</p>

          <p>India has shown a calm response to the U.S. imposing a 50% tariff on its goods and threatening secondary sanctions over its oil trade with Russia. There is a consensus in India that the move is a pressure tactic, and the government has signaled it will not compromise on key issues, particularly those affecting its farmers. While the tariffs could significantly impact sectors like gems, jewelry, and textiles, over 60% of India's GDP comes from domestic consumption, providing a buffer. India is pursuing diplomatic channels and appears to be in a "watch and wait" mode. (not investment advice)</p>

The arrests were made during a protest in Westminster in early July, and the three are scheduled to appear in court in September. Supporting the group, which was banned due to its direct-action protests against defense firms linked to Israel, is a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

          <p>The lawyer for Kathleen Folbigg, an Australian woman who spent 20 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of killing her four children, has condemned her AU$2 million compensation package as "hugely insulting." Folbigg was exonerated and released from prison after new scientific evidence showed her children likely died of natural causes. Her lawyer argued the sum is profoundly unjust given Folbigg lost her children, was vilified as a serial killer, and endured two decades of wrongful imprisonment. The government's decision on the compensation amount is final and cannot be appealed.</p>

          <p>In cities like Shanghai, elderly Chinese citizens have been gathering in fast-food restaurants to escape the summer heat, taking advantage of the free air conditioning. However, this practice has sparked criticism on social media, with some users complaining that the seniors occupy seats for long periods without purchasing any food or drinks. The phenomenon highlights a cultural clash and raises questions about the availability of public spaces for the elderly. This situation reflects a broader social issue concerning how communities accommodate their aging populations, especially during periods of extreme weather.</p>

The request came just a day after she was interrogated as part of one of three special investigations targeting the former conservative administration.

If the court approves the warrant, it would be the first time in the country's history that a former president and first lady have both been arrested.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reportedly reached an agreement to sign striker Darwin Nunez from Liverpool for a fee of £46.3 million (€53m). The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is now expected to travel for a medical to finalize the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64m but had a limited role last season, starting only eight Premier League games. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial flexibility to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak, during the current window.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece criticizes NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman for joining Donald Trump's new sports council, arguing it contradicts the league's stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. The council's stated goals include "keeping men out of women's sports," a position that directly targets transgender athletes. The author points to the NHL's past wavering on LGBTQ+ issues, such as banning Pride-themed jerseys, as evidence of a pattern of prioritizing certain perspectives over genuine inclusion. The move is described as a "deeply disturbing" step backward for making hockey a more welcoming sport for all.</p>

          <p>In response to a query from NPR, readers shared their personal strategies for curbing the impulse to buy things they don't need. Common tactics include delaying purchases by leaving items in an online cart or adding them to a browser's "wish list" to see if the desire fades over time. Other suggestions involved turning shopping into a game by picking out items without buying them or visiting a library or thrift store to satisfy the "thrill of the hunt" without significant spending. The advice focuses on creating intentionality and finding deeper, non-material sources of fulfillment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps that jeopardize access to birth control for millions of Americans, particularly those with low incomes. This includes withholding federal funds from the Title X family planning program, with some providers suing the administration over what they claim are illegal funding suspensions. Additionally, cuts to Medicaid and policies outlined in the GOP-backed Project 2025 blueprint seek to limit requirements for insurance to cover contraception. Public health advocates argue these moves create a structure that makes it harder for individuals to control their reproductive lives.</p>
