          <p>Two 16-year-old boys have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of over 15 years for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa. The attack occurred on a public bus in Woolwich, London, where Bokassa was stabbed 27 times with machetes in a premeditated assault that lasted 14 seconds. The court heard that the assailants, who have previous convictions for carrying knives, appeared to have been tipped off about their victim's location. In a victim impact statement, Kelyan's mother described herself as a "broken soul" and pleaded with young people to stop carrying knives.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into deadly clashes, prompting Thailand to declare martial law in eight border regions. The Thai military reported conducting airstrikes on the Cambodian side of the border, alleging that Cambodian forces had first launched artillery shells into Thai territory. The conflict, now in its second day, has prompted an emergency, closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council to address the crisis. The situation remains volatile, with concerns that the border dispute could escalate into a more extensive military conflict between the two nations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of 220 Members of Parliament from nine different parties has signed a letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The signatories, more than half of whom are from the Labour Party, argue the move would be a "powerful symbolic message" and a crucial step toward a two-state solution. In response, Starmer stated that recognition must be part of a broader, practical peace plan that ensures lasting security for both Palestinians and Israelis. This call for action puts additional pressure on the UK, especially after France committed to recognizing Palestinian statehood within months.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detailed the recent arrests of several undocumented immigrants with prior convictions for violent and serious crimes. The agency highlighted specific cases, including individuals from El Salvador and Mexico convicted of offenses such as sexual assault against a child, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and arson. A Department of Homeland Security official credited the Trump administration's policies for the arrests, stating the actions remove dangerous criminals from American communities. These enforcement actions are part of a broader push to increase the arrest of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogačar has effectively secured his fourth Tour de France victory after successfully defending his significant lead in the final mountain stage. While Dutch rider Thymen Arensman claimed a dramatic win on the grueling ascent to La Plagne, Pogačar finished alongside his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, maintaining a comfortable lead of over four minutes. With only two flatter stages remaining before the finale in Paris, Pogačar's overall triumph is all but certain. The stage also saw Britain's Oscar Onley solidify a strong fourth-place position in the general classification, marking him as a promising young talent.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers and policy experts are criticizing the U.S. legal immigration system, describing it as "designed to fail" with wait times for some applicants stretching for decades or even over a century. The article highlights the immense backlog, with only 3% of 34.7 million pending green card applications approved last fiscal year, forcing many to seek illegal routes. Some politicians are re-introducing reform legislation like the Dignity Act, arguing that the current system harms not only immigrants but also the U.S. economy, which relies on immigrant labor.

Despite this, he was not seen in person by healthcare professionals for over four months and was not considered to be in a crisis situation.

          <p>This literary analysis explores how the Greek island of Corfu, while only a minor setting in John le Carré's masterpiece "A Perfect Spy," served as a crucial catalyst for the novel's themes. The article discusses how a real-life encounter le Carré had on the island with a former associate of his con-artist father helped shape the book's central exploration of betrayal and identity. For the novel's protagonist, the traitorous spy Magnus Pym, Corfu becomes a place of hiding and a backdrop for temptation. The piece suggests that the island's own history of being invaded and influenced by outside forces mirrors the novel's complex themes.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter profit, citing the significant impact of U.S. tariffs and restructuring costs. The company stated that U.S. tariffs alone cost it 1.3 billion euros in the first half of the year. In response to these challenges and robust competition, Volkswagen has lowered its expected operating return on sales for 2025. The announcement highlights the vulnerability of the European auto industry to global trade policies, particularly President Trump's import tariffs of 25%. (not investment advice)</p>

Witkoff stated that Hamas's response to the latest proposal showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire," prompting Israel to also recall its negotiators. As talks break down, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, with the UN reporting that children are starving to death due to Israel's blockade and military offensive. UNICEF noted a 180% increase in acute malnourishment among children since February, with aid deliveries at only 6% of pre-war levels.</p>

          <p>A former FBI agent has suggested a potential motive for the brutal 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. The agent, Jennifer Coffindaffer, theorized that Kohberger's attack on Kaylee Goncalves was particularly vicious because her presence in the same bed as Madison Mogen, the alleged primary target, "ruined his plans." Goncalves suffered over 30 stab wounds and was left disfigured. At Kohberger's sentencing, where he received four life sentences, Goncalves's family delivered scathing victim impact statements, condemning him and expressing their profound grief over the loss of their daughter.</p>

Williams, who pleaded not guilty, is the only jail employee charged in connection with the May breakout, where inmates escaped through a hole behind a toilet. His attorney argues that Williams is being blamed for security issues, such as broken locks and cameras, that the sheriff had previously warned city officials about. Meanwhile, one of the escaped inmates, convicted of murder, remains at large over two months after the incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump's diplomatic trip to Scotland is being overshadowed by new revelations about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A new report claims Trump's name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday, deepening the controversy over the administration's failure to release all investigative files. In response to the growing backlash, Trump has sued the Wall Street Journal over its reporting and barred its journalists from the Scotland trip. The ongoing scandal adds a layer of political turmoil to his visit, which includes high-stakes trade talks with the UK prime minister.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed he is launching a new political party aimed at challenging the "rich and powerful." The yet-unnamed party plans to contest local elections in May ahead of the next general election. Polling suggests the new entity could capture up to 10% of the vote, potentially splitting the left-wing electorate and drawing support away from both the Labour and Green parties. The move could significantly shake up the UK political landscape, with allies of Corbyn indicating a willingness to form electoral pacts with the Greens to maximize their collective impact.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the challenge but stated that efforts were being made to minimize disruption and keep as many non-urgent services running as possible. This marks the 12th strike by the British Medical Association (BMA) since March 2023, after negotiations with the government failed. The BMA has begun granting some requests for doctors to leave picket lines to work in hospitals under the most severe pressure, but widespread cancellations of appointments are still expected.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School, suggests that while AI is not yet ready to replace most human jobs, it will be a "huge concern" for entry-level workers. He argues that the immediate challenge is not mass unemployment but figuring out how to develop expertise when AI can perform many foundational tasks, a process traditionally learned through apprenticeship. Mollick advises that leadership in organizations and education must take an active role in shaping how AI is integrated, rather than leaving it to individuals. He also suggests that jobs with many bundled, diverse tasks are more resilient to being automated than single-focus roles.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Premier League's summer transfer window reveals that spending has been heavily dominated by the league's top clubs, with Liverpool leading the way at £269 million spent so far. Chelsea and Arsenal have also spent over £200 million each, acquiring high-profile players to strengthen their squads. This concentration of spending at the top, which also includes Manchester City and Manchester United, contrasts with the rest of the league. Football finance experts note that while the figures are high, Liverpool's financial position is strong due to increased revenues, and the spending is within profit and sustainability rules.

Experts suggest the market may be impacted by a generational shift, as younger, digitally-native collectors show different tastes than the baby boomers who long drove the market. In response, auction houses are adapting by focusing on online sales and luxury goods like jewelry, which saw a 68% jump in sales. (not investment advice)</p>
