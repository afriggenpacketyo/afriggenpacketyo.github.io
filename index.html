          <p>A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report projects that tariffs implemented by President Trump could reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over a decade, leading to a total deficit reduction of $4.0 trillion. This article, an opinion piece, challenges traditional free-trade economists to reconsider their stance, given that inflation has not spiked and growth has not plummeted. It also raises questions about the extent of presidential executive authority to impose such tariffs, noting a pending legal challenge that could reach the Supreme Court. The piece suggests that while tariffs are a tax, their strategic use might promote freer trade.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the expulsion of Iran's Ambassador and other diplomats, accusing the Iranian government of directing two antisemitic arson attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Australian intelligence concluded Iran used "cut-out facilitators" to task Australians with these "extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression."

          <p>European (E3) and Iranian diplomats are holding last-minute talks in Geneva as a deadline approaches for Europeans to potentially reimpose sanctions on Iran via a "snapback mechanism." Concerns over Iran's nuclear program have escalated since it ceased cooperation with the IAEA after the Iran-Israel war, leaving its near-weapons-grade uranium stockpile unmonitored. Iran insists its program is peaceful and disputes the legal basis for snapback, arguing the E3 failed to uphold the 2015 nuclear deal's economic benefits.

          <p>China plans to expand its carbon market to include major industries by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, demonstrating its commitment to climate targets. The new guidelines will introduce absolute limits on emissions, a stricter standard than the current carbon intensity-based caps. This move is expected to boost demand in the often-sluggish carbon market and lead to a more aggressive emissions pathway for China, the world's largest carbon polluter. Steel, aluminum, and cement industries will be added this year under less stringent initial rules.</p>
