          <p>Law enforcement officials are warning that drug dealers are increasingly using emojis on social media to code names for drugs being sold. An investigation in Lompoc, California, revealed that a 15-year-old student provided edible cannabis products to other students, leading to an investigation that uncovered an Instagram account used to sell various illicit substances to underage children. The investigation found that emojis were used in payment transactions and messages to identify the drugs being sold, highlighting the need for parents to monitor their children's social media activity. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has investigated numerous cases involving drug trafficking on internet apps, with dealers using encrypted messaging apps to finalize deals.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants to address rising program costs. This test would require recipients to prove their assets total less than $2,000, including the value of their primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. The proposal aims to save the state millions of dollars annually, but disability and health advocates are criticizing the plan, arguing that it could force older adults and people with disabilities into poverty. The Legislative Analystâ€™s Office reports that seniors, while a smaller portion of Medi-Cal enrollees, incur higher state costs per enrollee.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he is doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh. This decision follows a recent agreement regarding Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, which Trump characterized as ensuring the American company remains under U.S. control. The move aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States and protect American jobs, with promises of no layoffs or outsourcing. The United Steelworkers union, however, remains cautious, emphasizing the need for written commitments and prioritizing workers' interests over shareholder gains.</p>

While Musk has publicly stated he has a prescription for ketamine, the report claimed he used it as often as once a day, raising concerns among some associates about the impact on his businesses.

This decision involves terminating funding for major HIV vaccine research efforts at institutions like the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute. HHS claims the move aims to maximize the impact of federal taxpayer dollars and ensure proper oversight, while critics argue it will set back HIV vaccine research by a decade.

The strategic defence review, based on this trajectory, will prioritize military and security spending, including deploying new "digital" experts to protect troops from enemy drones. New funding will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, a move that has faced criticism.

          <p>The CDC now recommends that parents consult with a doctor about COVID-19 vaccinations for children, and there is no longer a recommendation for pregnant women to receive the vaccine. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who stated that the COVID vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule. Medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women based on scientific evidence. Public health experts are concerned about the closed-door process that led to the change and its potential impact on vaccination rates.</p>
