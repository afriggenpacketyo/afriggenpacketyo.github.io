The findings challenge the long-held belief that higher turnout universally benefits Democrats. The study highlights a shift in Trump's coalition, which became younger and more ethnically diverse compared to 2016, while also retaining a higher percentage of his 2020 voters than his opponent did of Biden's.</p>

The move came after a presentation by a former president of an anti-vaccine group founded by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long promoted disproven claims about the preservative. The recommendation was opposed by one committee member and drew criticism from medical groups, who noted the lack of scientific evidence for the decision and expressed concern it could fuel vaccine distrust.</p>
