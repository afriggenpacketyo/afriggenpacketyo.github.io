          <p>The Dalai Lama has affirmed that the 600-year-old institution will continue, stating his office will identify a successor in accordance with Tibetan Buddhist tradition. This announcement, made during his 90th birthday celebrations in Dharamshala, India, is seen as a message to China, which claims authority to name the next spiritual leader. He has consistently maintained that his successor will be found outside of China, a stance that angers Beijing, which views him as a separatist. The declaration puts an end to years of speculation about whether he would be the final Dalai Lama.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death in 1990, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 2-1 decision by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals makes Sockwell eligible for a retrial for the 1988 killing of a former sheriff. The court found a pattern of discriminatory intent, noting that 80% of potential Black jurors were rejected. The original trial judge had overridden a 7-5 jury recommendation for a life sentence, a practice now outlawed in Alabama.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-1 victory against the Chicago White Sox, propelled by a stellar performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto and early offensive power.

The Dodgers' offense ignited early with a four-run rally in the first inning, and Shohei Ohtani contributed with his 30th home run of the season.

          <p>Despite a series of high-level meetings, fundamental divisions between the European Union and China persist, undermining any notion of a relationship "reset." A senior EU official, speaking anonymously, stated that China attempts to portray the relationship as problem-free while failing to address significant economic imbalances and its support for Russia. These unresolved issues create a lack of balance that is not advantageous for the EU.

The intense competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, is also pressuring Tesla, whose sales in China are projected to decline.

          <p>British newspaper front pages are dominated by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's significant retreat on his welfare reform bill, a move the Financial Times says creates a multi-billion pound hole in public finances. The Guardian calls it a "dramatic climbdown" after a chaotic week, with the Telegraph suggesting emboldened left-wing MPs may now push for wealth taxes. Other major stories include the record number of small boat crossings, which the Daily Mail frames as a failure of Labour's border policy.

The settlement, which includes Trump's legal fees, resolves claims of news distortion and is seen by some as a move to clear the way for Paramount's sale to Skydance Media.

          <p>The White House has confirmed that some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine have been halted, citing a need "to put America's interests first." The decision follows a Department of Defense review of military aid and growing concerns within the Trump administration about depleting U.S. stockpiles. While the specific systems were not named, air defense missiles and precision munitions are reportedly affected. This move represents a significant policy shift and comes as Russia intensifies its aerial attacks on Ukraine, which has heavily relied on American military support since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly considering a significant strategic shift for the company's contract chip manufacturing business. The potential change involves de-emphasizing the "18A" manufacturing process for external customers, a technology heavily promoted by his predecessor, due to its declining appeal. Instead, the company may focus resources on its next-generation "14A" process to better compete with rival TSMC for major clients like Apple and Nvidia. This move, if approved by the board, could result in a substantial financial write-off but aims to revive the struggling chipmaker's long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

The chaotic episode has weakened his authority, drawn comparisons to the instability of previous governments, and led to questions about his leadership and the competence of his inner circle.

The facility, surrounded by swamps, was rapidly constructed to support the administration's intensified immigration crackdown and can house up to 3,000 people. Trump praised its secure location, remarking on the alligators as unpaid "bodyguards," and stated he wants similar facilities in other states to accelerate deportations.

This stands in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration. The administration has also deployed troops, increased interior enforcement, and launched a messaging campaign encouraging unauthorized immigrants to self-deport.</p>
