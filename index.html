          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, citing unclear U.S. tariff policies. Economists remain divided, with some seeing potential for growth upgrades while others anticipate a slowdown as the boost from front-loaded exports fades. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged past the $122,000 mark, setting a new record high driven by substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs logged over $1.18 billion in inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. The rally is also fueled by anticipation of clearer U.S. crypto regulations, with Congress set to deliberate on several relevant bills. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying is a key driver, with some predicting further appreciation, though potential risks from U.S. Federal Reserve policy remain.

          <p>During a visit to Beijing, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Chinese Vice President Han Zheng discussed advancing cooperation and stabilizing bilateral ties. Jaishankar noted a "positive trajectory" in relations, expressing confidence that the talks would continue this trend. This meeting, held on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security gathering, follows recent efforts to de-escalate tensions, including the resumption of direct flights after a nearly five-year halt. The improved dialogue comes after deadly border clashes in 2020 severely strained the relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <p>London Southend Airport has suspended all flights indefinitely after a small aircraft crashed upon takeoff, erupting into what witnesses described as a "huge fireball." The 12-meter plane, a Beech B200 Super King Air operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, reportedly banked sharply to the left before inverting and hitting the ground. The number of casualties has not been confirmed, and emergency services are on the scene. The Air Accident Investigation Branch is working with local police to investigate the cause of the tragic incident, which has prompted responses from transport officials.</p>

These signs suggest the economy is growing below its potential, which could help bring inflation down. The comments have led economists to anticipate a rate cut at the Bank's next meeting in August, following two previous cuts earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% year-over-year in June, beating analyst expectations and showing resilience amid global trade tensions. This growth was supported by strong shipments to Southeast Asian and European markets, as well as a slower decline in exports to the U.S. following a temporary tariff truce. Imports also saw their first increase of the year, rising 1.1%, though this was less than forecast. Despite the positive data, economists caution that the export momentum may not last due to continued uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and the potential fading of front-loading effects.

          <p>The catastrophic floods in Texas, which have claimed at least 129 lives, are being examined as a product of both climate change and political decisions. The disaster, one of the worst in the state's history, has been linked to an atmosphere that holds more moisture due to global warming, leading to more extreme rainfall events. This article explores how the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies like the National Weather Service may have hampered forecasting and emergency response coordination.

At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that the company overvalued properties to attract sellers and then incentivized staff to persuade clients to lower their prices.

          <p>Clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and fighters from the Druze religious minority in the southern Syrian city of Sweida have resulted in at least 30 deaths and scores of injuries. The country's interior ministry has dispatched forces to de-escalate the violence, which represents a rise in fighting between minority groups since the collapse of the Assad regime in December. The new Islamic-led government is struggling to establish control in a fragile post-war environment. The Druze community, which had a complex relationship with the former regime, has expressed fears about its safety under the new government.</p>

Pelicot's courage in insisting on a public trial shocked the nation and helped spur legal reforms, including a new bill that incorporates a lack of consent into the criminal definition of sexual assault.

While the number of systems was not specified, Trump stated that the European Union would reimburse the U.S. for the cost. The decision marks a significant development in U.S. policy towards the conflict, coming after Trump had previously expressed a desire to end the war quickly and the Pentagon had paused some arms shipments.

          <p>President Donald Trump is pushing for significant funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a move that could eliminate a vital news and safety resource for many rural communities. While the president accuses outlets like NPR and PBS of bias, federal funding is crucial for small, local stations, particularly in remote areas like Kotzebue, Alaska, where a public radio station is the only local news source and provides life-saving weather information. The proposed cuts have faced opposition from some Republican senators representing rural states, who argue that the funding is an invaluable resource for their constituents.</p>
