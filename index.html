        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea has lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, marking its fourth cut in the last six meetings, as South Korea faces political uncertainty following the impeachment of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol and economic challenges stemming from Trump's tariffs. The rate cut aims to mitigate downside risks to economic growth while keeping inflation stable, with the central bank slashing its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%. While a new president is expected to introduce fiscal stimulus, economists anticipate that a slump in the property sector and export disruptions could still drag down GDP growth.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This move aims to enhance scrutiny of future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong, as relations between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated due to trade disputes and other issues. The decision could impact approximately 280,000 Chinese students studying in the U.S., many of whom rely on foreign student tuition fees for funding, particularly at elite institutions. This action is part of a broader effort to address national security concerns and economic competition with China.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a key aspect of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, arguing that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has created a national emergency that has decimated American communities. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the ruling as a victory for working families and small businesses.</p>

          <p>The government has fast-tracked two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to bolster England's water supplies, declaring them "nationally significant" to expedite the planning process. These projects aim to increase resilience against future droughts, particularly in dry regions with high water demand, with completion targeted for 2036 and 2040, respectively. While the government intends to legislate to automatically make other proposed reservoirs "nationally significant," some experts caution that managing water usage and reducing waste should be prioritized alongside infrastructure development. Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins blamed Labour's policies for pressures on water supplies.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs imposed after beginning his second term are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade's decision in V.O.S. Selections v. United States and Oregon v. Department of Homeland Security argues that Trump surpassed these limits and that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) cannot grant unlimited tariff authority. While the decision can be appealed, it argues that the tariffs do not address the nation's trade deficit and that they don't effectively deter drug trafficking. The court has issued a permanent injunction on a nationwide basis.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from the south of Scotland after being absent for years, raising hopes that they might nest in the area.

These eagles have also been sighted in the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. While it is too early to determine if they will settle permanently, this development marks a potentially exciting milestone for wildlife conservation.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that Harvard should cap the number of international students it admits to create more spots for Americans, questioning the high percentage of foreign students at the university. This statement follows the Department of Homeland Security's recent move to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a decision that has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. The Trump administration has been targeting universities, including Harvard, over alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus and has also attacked policies supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

          <p>California has joined 15 other states in a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation, alleging that the agency has illegally terminated millions of dollars in grants and imposed new fees that have harmed vital research. The lawsuit targets the NSF for terminating grants for scientific research that seeks to promote diversity in higher education and the workforce. The suit also seeks to overturn the Trump administration’s 15% cap on indirect costs related to research, which universities say are critical to carrying out their work. The lawsuit asserts that Trump’s actions threaten America’s position as a global leader in scientific innovation.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that he exceeded his authority, marking a major blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has swiftly appealed the ruling, while global financial markets have reacted with stock market gains and a stronger US dollar against safe-haven currencies.</p>
