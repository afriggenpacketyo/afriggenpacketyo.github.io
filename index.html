        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic legislators, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025. The bill aims to make excessive price hikes illegal, granting more power to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to prosecute alleged abuses. Citing President Trump's tariff policies as a cover for corporations to unnecessarily raise prices, the legislation would require large companies to report significant price changes and justify them. The proposal, which has garnered support from labor unions, would also allocate an additional $1 billion in funding to the FTC for enforcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular online health trend involving drinking water mixed with chia seeds, promoted as an "internal shower," could have negative effects if not prepared correctly. Experts advise that for the high-fiber drink to aid digestion and prevent constipation, the seeds must be soaked for at least 20 minutes to form a gel-like coating. Consuming them too quickly can cause the seeds to absorb water within the gut, leading to bloating, gas, and constipation, effectively reversing the intended benefits. Nutritionists recommend starting with small amounts to allow the digestive system to adapt to the increased fiber intake.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump underwent vascular testing due to mild swelling in his lower legs. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the examination, which included doppler ultrasounds, revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition for his age. The tests showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and an echocardiogram indicated normal heart function. Leavitt also attributed minor bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, reiterating that he remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum visited the former federal prison on Alcatraz Island to receive a briefing and discuss plans for its reopening. The visit follows President Donald Trump's directive in May to rebuild and reopen the notorious facility, which closed over 60 years ago. The administration views the reopening as a symbol of law and order, while critics have attacked the move as a waste of resources. The visit's agenda included discussing facility needs with Park Police and directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning for the prison's restoration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly one in four Americans over the age of 50 are postponing their retirement, a significant increase from the previous year. The primary reasons cited are financial uncertainties, including worries about inflation, a potential recession, and stock market volatility. This trend highlights the financial precarity facing many in the Gen X generation as they approach traditional retirement age, with a separate study noting the median savings for a 55-year-old is just $50,000. Financial experts advise that delaying Social Security claims can increase monthly benefits and stress the importance of consistent saving, no matter the amount. (not investment advice)</p>

Proponents argue this change is critical, as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, yet is not explicitly listed as a disaster type.

Ministers argue the change will increase democratic engagement, while critics suggest it is a political move to benefit the Labour Party, which polls strongly among younger voters. However, experts note that 16 and 17-year-olds represent a small fraction of the electorate and that their lower turnout rates would likely result in a negligible impact on overall election results. The move follows the fracturing of the youth vote, with parties like the Greens, Liberal Democrats, and Reform UK also competing for their support.</p>

The initial comments led to a year-long suspension, and her decision to reaffirm them has drawn criticism, including from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.

This aligns with Walmart's previous warning that it could not absorb the full impact of the duties.

          <p>While annuities are often marketed as a safe and reliable source of retirement income, it is possible to lose money under certain circumstances. Financial experts warn of several risks, including high surrender charges for early withdrawals, which can significantly erode returns. Variable annuities carry market risk, meaning their value can fall if underlying investments underperform, and fixed annuities can lose purchasing power over time due to inflation. Furthermore, the security of an annuity is tied to the financial stability of the issuing insurance company, making it crucial for investors to research the provider's health before purchasing.

          <p>A man on trial for assaulting police officers during a brawl at Manchester Airport testified that he believed an officer was going to kill him. The 20-year-old and his brother are accused of attacking officers who were attempting to make an arrest in a car park last year. The defendant told the jury he was frightened when an officer grabbed him and tried to force him to the ground, stating he feared being fatally beaten. The prosecution alleges the brothers subjected officers to a high level of violence, which resulted in one officer suffering a broken nose, while the defendants insist they acted in self-defense.</p>

          <p>The six largest U.S. banks generated approximately $39 billion in second-quarter profits, exceeding analyst expectations and signaling a surprisingly strong financial environment. Despite initial market fears over President Trump's tariff policies, a boom in trading and investment banking has bolstered Wall Street. Banks like JPMorgan Chase reported robust loan growth and cooling economic risk indicators, suggesting a low probability of a near-term recession. This performance reflects corporate and consumer confidence, as businesses proceed with major transactions and American consumers continue to spend and borrow, painting a positive picture for the economy.

Authorities have not released the suspect's identity or the specific charges he faces, nor have they commented on a possible motive.

Chepngetich tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic that can be used as a masking agent for other performance-enhancing substances. The positive test occurred in March, and Chepngetich opted for a voluntary provisional suspension in April while the investigation was ongoing. This case is the latest in a series of doping violations involving prominent Kenyan runners, casting a shadow over the nation's dominance in long-distance running.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has recommended a sentence of only one day in jail for Brett Hankison, the former police officer convicted of civil rights abuse in the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor. Hankison was found guilty of firing blindly into Taylor's apartment, endangering her neighbors. In a sentencing memo, the DOJ argued for a lenient sentence of three years supervised release, citing that Hankison did not hit anyone and has no prior record. If the judge accepts the recommendation, Hankison would serve no additional jail time, as his booking would count toward the single day.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement about Coca-Cola potentially switching to cane sugar, health experts are weighing in on whether it is healthier than high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians note that while there are minor chemical differences, both sweeteners have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess, contributing to conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Both are considered empty calories and have a high glycemic index, raising blood sugar similarly. The American Heart Association recommends limiting all forms of added sugar, including both cane sugar and corn syrup, as most Americans consume far more than the recommended daily amount.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent repeal of many green-energy tax breaks from the Inflation Reduction Act is a positive development, despite not being a full rollback. The author contends that such subsidies distort the market, misallocate capital, and create cronyism rather than genuine innovation and abundance. While acknowledging that some fossil-fuel subsidies also exist and should be removed, the article asserts they are dwarfed by the scale of green-energy incentives. The piece concludes that the partial rollback demonstrates that fighting against entrenched special-interest tax preferences is possible and should be pursued further. (not investment advice)</p>
