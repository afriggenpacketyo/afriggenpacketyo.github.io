          <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer on the film "Rust," has been released from prison on parole after serving 13 months of her 18-month sentence for involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The tragic on-set shooting in 2021, involving actor Alec Baldwin discharging a prop gun with live rounds, shook Hollywood and raised questions about safety protocols. Gutierrez-Reed was granted parole to Arizona and must adhere to conditions including electronic monitoring and maintaining employment or school enrollment. Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter charge was dismissed during trial due to withheld evidence.</p>

          <p>The Trump DOJ is seeking to dissolve the Flores Consent Decree, which has governed the detention and release of migrant children since 1997. Attorney General Pam Bondi argues the decree incentivizes illegal immigration at the southern border, restricting the America-first immigration agenda. The motion will be heard by Judge Dolly Gee, who has presided over the case for years, making it unlikely she will agree to get rid of the Flores decree, setting up a possible battle before the federal appeals court, and ultimately the Supreme Court. DOJ officials aim to return power to elected officials in Washington rather than a single federal judge in California.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's upcoming gubernatorial elections feature hotly contested primaries, with experts suggesting the race could indicate national sentiment ahead of the 2026 midterms. The Democratic primary has a crowded field, including Mikie Sherrill, Josh Gottheimer, and Ras Baraka, while Republicans hope to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli. Issues like immigration enforcement, housing costs, and affordability are central to the race.

          <p>A federal judge halted the Trump administration’s attempts to block international students from attending Harvard University, after Harvard sued the administration. Harvard argued that the decision would cause “immediate and irreparable injury” to the university and accused the administration of a “campaign of retribution.” The lawsuit followed an announcement that Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification had been revoked, halting the university’s ability to enroll international students.</p>

The order is a temporary stay, allowing the court to consider an emergency application from the administration arguing that Musk's group should be exempt from public records laws. The administration argues that Musk's group is a presidential advisory body, not a federal agency, and is therefore exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

Treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting to drain excess fluid. Experts emphasize that early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis, though some symptoms may become irreversible in later stages.</p>
