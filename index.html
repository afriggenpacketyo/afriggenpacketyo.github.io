            <p>Asian shares experienced significant losses, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping by over 5%, following the implementation of new U.S. tariffs, including a substantial 104% levy on Chinese imports. Investors have been unsettled by the ongoing trade war initiated by President Trump, leading to market volatility. Despite some initial optimism, the imposition of higher tariffs has dampened enthusiasm, raising concerns about increased prices for American consumers and potential economic slowdown. Analysts warn of continued market fluctuations depending on the duration and negotiation of these tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>India's central bank reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022, in an effort to stimulate slowing economic growth. The rate cut aligns with expectations, coinciding with the U.S.' reciprocal tariffs that include a 26% levy on Indian goods. The Reserve Bank of India acknowledged that tariffs have increased uncertainties, posing challenges to global growth and inflation. This move comes amid softening inflation and a slowing economy, with the RBI expressing confidence that inflation will align with its 4% target over the next 12 months. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest tariffs on imports, including a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, have taken effect, escalating the potential for a global trade war. Asian financial markets have reacted negatively, and U.S. stock futures indicate a likely fifth consecutive day of losses on Wall Street. The White House maintains that the tariffs aim to initiate negotiations with trading partners, prioritizing deals that benefit American workers. China has vowed to retaliate, promising countermeasures to defend its interests, and business experts warn of potential higher inflation as a result of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>The tiny country of Liechtenstein is facing significant tariffs from the Trump administration, with a 37% tariff imposed on its exports to the US. This is almost double the tariff rate applied to its European neighbors. The tariffs are seen as a punishment for the country's trade surplus with the US, despite its small size and limited influence. Locals express confusion and concern about the unpredictable nature of Trump's trade policies.</p>

This would involve placing restrictions on purchases of services from US firms and limiting cooperation between Chinese companies and US law firms and consultancies. Other potential countermeasures include increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on fentanyl control, and investigating US companies in China over intellectual property issues.</p>

The CDC teams deploy to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas-run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies, work with local schools and healthcare facilities to support contact investigations, and to reach out to communities, including faith leaders, to answer any questions or respond to locations seeking healthcare."</p>

            <p>Cambodia, facing the highest tariff rate under President Trump's new trade plan, is unlikely to see its manufacturing reshore to the US. Despite the 49% tariff rate causing an existential crisis for Cambodian factories, manufacturers are exploring other countries to relocate their supply chains. A trade group representing US interests in the retail manufacturing hub notes that Americans are unlikely to want to perform the labor-intensive garment work. The White House's claim that Cambodia's tariffs on the U.S. reach as high as 97% is disputed by the country and multiple sources.</p>

An investigation by Australia's Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) found one of the pilots did not hear a vital radio call shortly before the accident, and that a series of changes by Sea World meant risk controls were over time eroded. Four people died - including two British tourists - and several more were seriously injured when the two aircraft hit each other in January 2023, near Sea World on the Gold Coast.</p>
