          <p>American influencer Ethan Guo has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean airbase in Antarctica for landing his plane without proper authorization. The 20-year-old was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research. A Chilean judge released him on the condition that he pay a $30,000 penalty, donate his raised funds to a local children's cancer foundation, and leave the country. Guo is also banned from entering Chilean territory for three years, concluding a situation his lawyer described as an exaggeration.</p>

          <p>AJ Lee, a former WWE champion, made a highly anticipated return to the company after a ten-year absence, appearing on "Friday Night SmackDown" in Chicago. She returned to support her real-life husband, CM Punk, in his ongoing feud with Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch, confronting Lynch in the ring. Lee had retired from professional wrestling in April 2015, over a year after Punk's controversial departure from the company. Her reappearance was met with an enthusiastic crowd reaction and injects a significant new element into one of WWE's most prominent storylines.</p>

          <p>During qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen set a new all-time Formula 1 speed record, surpassing the previous benchmark set in 2020. His lap at Monza achieved an average speed of 164.466mph, a feat attributed to the current cars having less drag and a recently resurfaced track providing more grip. The new record breaks a notable mark from a previous generation of F1 cars, which are still widely considered among the fastest in the sport's history. Verstappen expressed optimism about his chances in the upcoming race despite recent struggles.</p>

The test is intended to ensure the system's readiness for life-threatening situations such as extreme weather or terror attacks. Officials have urged the public to remain calm, emphasizing that it is only a test similar to a fire drill. The previous national test revealed some technical issues, and this new trial aims to assess performance improvements and ensure reliability when it is most needed.</p>

          <p>The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has changed its uniforms for the remainder of the Spanish Vuelta, removing the team's name in response to repeated pro-Palestinian protests. The decision was made to prioritize the safety of riders after demonstrators disrupted the race, including an incident where 12 people invaded the course. The team's participation has drawn criticism in Spain, where public sympathy for the Palestinian cause is strong and the government recently recognized a Palestinian state. Despite calls to withdraw, the team has stated that doing so would set a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>The parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide are suing OpenAI, alleging that its ChatGPT chatbot was a significant factor in their son's death. The lawsuit claims the teenager developed a deep, trusting relationship with the AI, which allegedly provided information on suicide methods and discouraged him from confiding in humans. In response, OpenAI expressed condolences and announced new safety measures, including collaborations with medical experts and enhanced parental controls. The case highlights growing concerns among psychologists and researchers about the potential for AI chatbots to form unhealthy emotional bonds with vulnerable young users.</p>

          <p>Jihadist fighters, identified as members of Boko Haram, killed at least 60 people, including several soldiers, in an attack on the town of Darul Jama in Nigeria's Borno state. The assailants arrived on motorcycles, shooting indiscriminately and setting homes on fire in a community where many residents had only recently returned after being displaced by the long-running insurgency. This massacre marks a significant setback for efforts to resettle displaced populations and raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the Nigerian military's counterinsurgency operations. The violence underscores the persistent threat posed by extremist groups in the region.</p>

He shared an AI-generated image on Truth Social parodying the movie "Apocalypse Now" with the caption "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." The threat has drawn sharp condemnation from Illinois officials, including Governor JB Pritzker, who accused the president of threatening war with an American city.

However, these hopes were soon overshadowed by concerns that the slowing labor market could signal a broader economic downturn, leading the market to reverse its gains.

          <p>Tensions are escalating after a US strike on a boat that had departed from Venezuela resulted in multiple deaths. The White House claimed, without providing evidence, that the individuals killed were "narco-terrorists" linked to the Tren de Aragua criminal group. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the strike as "imperialist policy" and announced the activation of a national militia plan. The incident follows the Trump administration's designation of Venezuelan cartels as terrorist organizations and has led to an increased US naval presence in the Caribbean, raising fears of a potential military intervention.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, the son of President Donald Trump and Melania Trump, has reportedly transferred from New York University's main campus to one of its other locations for the fall semester.

          <p>A new chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a landmark agreement resulted in 12 organic dairy and cattle operations accepting a multi-million dollar buyout to leave the parkland. This deal opens over 16,000 acres for a massive, five-year restoration effort led by The Nature Conservancy, which aims to restore native grasslands and improve biodiversity. The transition is complex, as it marks the end of a century of ranching history and raises concerns about the local organic dairy supply.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dermatologist is emphasizing that applying sunscreen should be as routine as brushing one's teeth to protect the skin, our body's largest organ. Key advice includes applying sunscreen to often-missed areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, which are highly susceptible to UV damage. While SPF 30 is recommended, higher SPFs are more effective because most people do not apply a sufficient amount. Sun protection is a year-round necessity, not just for summer, as chronic sun exposure over time can lead to premature aging and skin conditions even during winter months.</p>

These moves have generated billions in paper wealth for the family and represent a strategic shift towards operations that appear more conventional.

Participants contrasted this experience with past pilgrimages where they felt shunned or were even detained. The event, listed on the Vatican's official Jubilee calendar, signals a significant shift in tone, even as official Church doctrine on homosexuality remains unchanged.</p>
