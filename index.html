While some analysts expressed concern over delayed capital expenditures, the company's revenue more than tripled from the previous year, and it issued an optimistic revenue forecast for 2025.

          <p>Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is expanding its employee discount program to help its workforce cope with rising living costs. The company announced that its 1.6 million U.S. employees will now receive a 10% discount on nearly all grocery items year-round, a benefit previously limited to produce and seasonal periods. This move comes as concerns over inflation are renewed due to tariffs, and it serves a dual purpose of supporting employees and encouraging them to shop at Walmart, potentially boosting retention and sales.</p>

          <p>In a widely followed Massachusetts retrial, Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. The jury did, however, convict her on a charge of driving under the influence. The defense successfully argued that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, countering the prosecution's claim that she struck O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die in a snowstorm. The verdict concludes a complex case that previously ended in a mistrial.</p>

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid funding previously appropriated by Congress. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturns a lower court's injunction that had forced the release of the funds. The ruling stated that the grant recipients challenging the president's executive order did not meet the legal requirements for the injunction, allowing the administration to freeze aid for programs including global health and HIV/AIDS support.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin gradually suspending flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations stalled over key issues like wages and unpaid work time, with a walkout set to begin Saturday. In response, the airline issued a lockout notice, warning of a complete cessation of flying that could affect 130,000 daily customers during the peak summer travel season. The carrier is offering full refunds for canceled flights and attempting to arrange alternative travel options.</p>

The article explains that homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at around 80% of the total equity.

          <p>Following President Trump's criticism of a Goldman Sachs report, many other Wall Street economists are echoing the sentiment that increased tariffs will lead to higher consumer inflation. The consensus view is that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, companies will increasingly pass the higher costs onto consumers for the remainder of the year. While no one is predicting runaway inflation, the anticipated rise could push the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure into the low-to-mid 3% range, potentially impacting consumer spending and overall economic growth.

          <p>This analysis piece suggests President Trump's approach to his upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin is evolving, shifting from initial talk of a land-swap deal to a "listening exercise" and now a potential push for an immediate ceasefire. The author notes that Trump's expectations appear changeable, possibly reflecting fluid back-room negotiations ahead of the high-stakes summit in Alaska. Trump has floated the idea of a follow-up meeting involving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but only if the initial talks go well, indicating he is preparing for both success and failure in his diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <h2>California Officials Warn of 'Chilling Effect' from Proposed Ban on Immigrant Benefits</h2>

          <p>California officials are warning that a Trump administration proposal to bar undocumented immigrants from federally funded programs would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities. In court filings opposing the new rules, officials stated the ban would cut off access to vital services like emergency shelters, healthcare, and nutritional support for immigrants and even some U.S. citizens. They argue the policy would create a "chilling effect," discouraging families from seeking necessary aid and placing immense strain on the state's emergency healthcare and social safety nets.</p>

          <p>A European Commission plan to impose penalties on Israel for its actions in Gaza remains deadlocked due to disagreements among EU member states, with Germany among those requesting more time for review. The proposal, which would bar Israeli startups from accessing EU research funds, was introduced in response to the severe humanitarian crisis and alleged human rights violations in Gaza. While some nations like Spain advocate for a full suspension of the EU-Israel trade pact, the lack of consensus prevents any action from being taken, drawing criticism from human rights organizations.</p>

          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League is estimating that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost recipients saw in 2025. The annual adjustment is designed to ensure that benefits keep pace with inflation, and the official figure will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October. Some economists express concern that this moderate increase may not be sufficient if inflation rates rise later in the year as predicted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article raises alarms about President Trump's replacement of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) with a loyalist, E. J. Antoni, from the conservative Heritage Foundation. The author argues this move mirrors tactics used by authoritarian regimes to control economic narratives by producing politically favorable, or "Potemkin," statistics. The piece highlights concerns from economists that appointing an ideologically-driven individual with thin credentials could undermine the credibility of crucial data like the monthly jobs report, potentially spooking international investors and damaging the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump appeared unconcerned by a report that Russia was at least partially responsible for a significant hack of the U.S. federal court's electronic document system. When questioned about the breach, which reportedly compromised sealed records, Trump responded, "Are you surprised?" and added, "They're good at it, we're good at it, we're actually better at it." The comments came just days before his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Trump said he "could" bring up the cyberattack.</p>

          <p>Ahead of his meeting with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning, threatening "severe consequences" if Russia does not agree to end its war in Ukraine. Speaking after a virtual conference with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump did not specify the nature of the consequences. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, telling allies that Putin is "bluffing" about peace and urging for more pressure through sanctions. Trump also indicated a desire for a follow-up meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but only if the initial summit proves productive.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a knotted cord device used for record-keeping, suggests the practice may have been more widespread than previously thought. Researchers discovered that the primary cord of one khipu was made of human hair, and a dietary analysis of the hair indicated its creator was likely a commoner, not a member of the ruling class. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that only elites produced these complex records. It suggests a continuity between ancient Incan practices and more modern khipus made by lower-status individuals like herders and laborers.</p>
