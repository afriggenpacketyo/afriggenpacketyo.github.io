          <h2>Trump Defends Attorney General Amid Conservative Backlash Over Epstein Case Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 16:45:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi as she faces mounting criticism from her own party's base. The backlash stems from a Justice Department memo that stated there was no "incriminating client list" related to Jeffrey Epstein, which contradicted the expectations of many conservatives and allies who anticipated major revelations. Figures like Laura Loomer and Megyn Kelly have openly criticized Bondi, creating a noticeable rift within the conservative movement. Trump urged his supporters to let Bondi perform her duties and to move on from the Epstein matter, highlighting a rare disconnect between him and his base on this issue.</p>

          <p>An Amazon delivery driver has tragically died after their van was hit by a train at a level crossing in Teynham, Kent. The collision occurred on Lower Road, and despite the immediate response from police and emergency services, the driver was pronounced dead at the scene. No other injuries were reported among the train's passengers or crew, who were safely transferred to another service. Both Amazon and Southeastern, the train operator, expressed their deep sadness and condolences to the driver's family. An investigation into the incident is now underway, involving the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to determine the cause of the fatal crash.</p>

          <h2>Justin Bieber's Surprise Album 'Swag' Delivers a Raw and Authentic R&B Sound</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 16:33:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise 21-track album titled "Swag," which critics are describing as a raw, improvisatory, and authentic return to his R&B roots. The album follows a tumultuous period for the artist, including health issues, a split with his longtime manager, and the birth of his first child. The music features murky, cooled-out grooves and includes demo-like tracks, reflecting a less polished and more personal creative process. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album embraces an idiosyncratic vibe that aligns with modern pop trends, showcasing a more instinctual and vulnerable side of Bieber's artistry and personal life.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a significant increase in the nation's defense budget, citing growing global threats and the need for France to be a formidable power. The plan aims to double annual defense spending to €64 billion by 2027, a goal previously set for 2030. In his traditional pre-Bastille Day speech, Macron emphasized that freedom has never been so seriously threatened since 1945, pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainties related to the United States. He stated that to be free, France must be feared, and to be feared, it must be powerful, signaling a major shift in military posture.</p>

          <p>A child has tragically died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, according to BBC reports. The hospital has seen a significant increase in children being admitted who are seriously unwell with the highly contagious virus, a trend linked to falling MMR vaccination rates in the region. While the hospital did not officially comment on the specific case, it confirmed the rising number of measles patients, including those with compromised immune systems. Public health officials are urging parents to vaccinate their children, as immunization rates in the North West of England are well below the 95% target set by the World Health Organization.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, confronted a heckler during a speech at a conservative youth conference, telling the individual he didn't have the "balls to be an ICE officer." Homan has become a prominent defender of the administration's mass deportation efforts, later appearing on news programs to walk back comments that seemed to confirm racial profiling by immigration agents. He clarified that physical appearance cannot be the sole factor for detention but also admitted that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests." His confrontational style has made him a key media surrogate for the administration's hardline immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A violent attack in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has resulted in the deaths of two young men, one of whom was a 20-year-old US citizen from Florida. The families of Sayfollah Musallet and 23-year-old Mohammed al-Shalabi allege they were attacked by Israeli settlers near the town of al-Mazra'a al-Sharqiya. Musallet was reportedly beaten to death, while al-Shalabi was shot. The incident highlights the escalating violence in the region, with the UN documenting over 2,000 settler attacks since early 2024. The US State Department is aware of the death and has offered consular services, as an investigation by Israeli authorities is reportedly underway.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man is in a heated dispute with his homeowners association (HOA) for providing free bottled water to his community during triple-digit temperatures. David Martin has been placing a cooler of water outside his home for delivery drivers, children, and neighbors but has received multiple $100 fines from the Canyon Trails HOA. The HOA's lawyer stated that while they don't object to providing water, their rules prohibit advertising it from a portable ice chest visible from neighboring properties. The conflict has escalated, with residents voting to recall board members, a result the HOA has since voided, setting the stage for a potential legal battle.</p>

          <p>Iranian state-affiliated media has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli attack on a secret underground facility in Tehran last month. According to the Fars news agency, the strikes targeted the facility on June 16 while Pezeshkian was in an emergency meeting, trapping officials before they escaped through an emergency shaft. This report, which has not been independently verified, comes after Pezeshkian accused Israel of attempting to assassinate him. The claims raise further questions about the extent of Israel's intelligence capabilities and the covert conflict between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting "the worst of the worst," government data reveals a different reality about who is being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to recent statistics, the majority of individuals in ICE detention, over 71%, have no criminal convictions. Of those who do have a record, relatively few have been convicted of the high-level violent crimes often cited by the administration. This analysis suggests a significant disconnect between the public justification for increased immigration enforcement and the actual profiles of the people being arrested and detained under the policy.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump's intention is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than eliminate it entirely. Speaking amidst criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem defended the administration's handling of the crisis as the "best response" in years. She also defended her policy of personally signing off on contracts over $100,000, which reportedly caused delays in renewing call center contracts during the disaster. Her comments suggest a shift in rhetoric from earlier statements by the administration about phasing out the agency, now focusing on reform and redeployment.</p>
