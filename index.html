          <p>A 68-year-old dog trainer, Christopher Kennedy, was incidentally diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a terminal lung disease, during a routine pre-surgery X-ray. Despite initial medications failing and his health declining, he became a candidate for a double-lung transplant at age 74. After a successful but challenging surgery and recovery, he has regained 98% lung capacity and is training a new therapy dog, celebrating his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's directive to release grand jury files related to Jeffrey Epstein, legal experts suggest the move may not reveal significant new information about Epstein's crimes or co-conspirators. Attorneys argue that grand jury transcripts are often limited and that more revealing details are likely contained in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memos. The push for release is seen as a damage control effort by the White House amid growing scrutiny over Trump's past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters chose not to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall effort, driven by civic groups, was seen as a potential way for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to gain a majority in the legislature. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance from the KMT and its allies, maintaining the current political deadlock.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's optimistic projections about driverless technology and robotaxis, Tesla investors are increasingly focused on the company's immediate challenges, including slumping sales and thinning profits. Following a weak earnings report, Tesla's stock fell, indicating that futuristic promises are no longer enough to offset concerns about rising competition and political headwinds affecting the brand. Analysts noted that while long-term opportunities like robotaxis are interesting, the company needs to show growth in its core automotive business now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, conditions in Niger have not improved and have worsened in some areas, according to analysts. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic woes as justification for the takeover, has overseen a period of increased job losses, particularly in the NGO sector, and a crackdown on civil liberties. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to democratic civilian rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>
