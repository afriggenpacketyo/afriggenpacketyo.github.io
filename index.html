          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a key commercial port in Iran near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least 14 deaths and over 750 injuries. The blast caused widespread damage, blowing out windows and roofs of nearby buildings, with residents feeling the impact up to 50km away. Initial reports suggested the fire resulted from improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, with warnings about chemical storage having been previously issued. The incident raises concerns about safety protocols at Iranian ports and potential security implications given the nature of the materials involved.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for allegedly attempting to intimidate the judiciary, following the arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for obstructing the apprehension of an undocumented immigrant. Critics argue that Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments suggest a broader effort to pressure judges who rule against the administration's policies. The arrest has sparked debate about the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, with some viewing it as an attempt to silence dissent and ensure compliance with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is threatening to halt imports of live animals from Mexico, including cattle and bison, due to the spread of the New World screwworm. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has given Mexico until April 30 to address the crisis, citing concerns about the flesh-eating fly larvae decimating livestock populations. The dispute centers on restrictions placed on a U.S. government-contracted carrier involved in aerial fly dispersal, as well as import duties on essential supplies. The USDA is proposing an emergency summit to resolve the issue and protect America's agricultural industry.</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy, signaling a potential successor amid concerns about Abbas's age and leadership. The appointment comes as the war in Gaza intensifies and Israeli military operations increase in the West Bank. Some analysts believe this move indicates Abbas's preference for al-Sheikh as his heir, while others see it as an attempt to appease Arab officials frustrated with the Palestinian leadership. The focus on succession politics has drawn criticism from Palestinians, who view it as disconnected from the pressing issues of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Recent polls suggest that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump, with a majority describing his second term as "scary".

The polls also reveal disapproval of Trump's trade policies and handling of immigration, with even Republicans expressing reservations.

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance states that trans women should generally not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and schools. The EHRC clarifies that transgender individuals are still protected against discrimination. A consultation is expected to launch in May to seek views from affected stakeholders, with an updated code of practice due by the end of June.</p>

          <p>Russia claims it has regained full control of the Kursk region from Ukraine, however Ukraine has denied Russian claims that it has been forced out of Russia's Kursk region. Valery Gerasimov, chief of staff of Russia's military, said his forces had regained full control of the region, eight months after Ukrainian forces first launched a surprise incursion into the border region. Ukraine says its troops are still conducting operations in Kursk, with the military describing Russia's claims as "propaganda tricks".</p>
