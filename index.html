        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wales' chances of automatically qualifying for the 2026 World Cup have been effectively eliminated following a 4-2 defeat to Belgium. Despite an aggressive start, the Welsh team was ultimately outmatched by Belgium's clinical counter-attacks, led by players like Jeremy Doku and Kevin De Bruyne. Head coach Craig Bellamy defended his team's offensive strategy, stating it was necessary to secure a win, but the approach left them defensively vulnerable. Wales will now likely need to navigate the play-offs to secure a spot in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland was defeated 1-0 by Germany in a closely contested World Cup qualifying match at Windsor Park in Belfast. The decisive goal came from a fortunate deflection off Nick Woltemade's shoulder in the first half. Despite a disallowed goal and a strong second-half performance where they pressured the German defense, Northern Ireland could not find an equalizer. The loss makes automatic qualification for the World Cup a long shot, but the team's chances for a play-off spot remain viable ahead of their final matches.</p>

          <p>Doug Lebda, the visionary founder and CEO of the financial marketplace LendingTree, has died at the age of 55 in an all-terrain vehicle accident on his family farm. Lebda established the company in 1996 after facing frustrations with his own mortgage process, aiming to simplify consumer finance. He led the company through its initial public offering and several major corporate transitions over the years. In response to his sudden death, LendingTree's board has appointed Steve Ozonian as Chairman and Scott Peyree as the new CEO.</p>

          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a restaurant in Baltimore, is introducing diners to the unique and aromatic flavors of Venezuelan cuisine through a concept its founder calls "culinary diplomacy." The key to its distinct taste lies in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are difficult to source in the U.S. and are now being locally grown by a Maryland farmer. Founder Irena Stein and her chefs aim to provide an authentic cultural experience, with the fragrant peppers forming the essential base for their dishes and creating a memorable culinary journey for their customers.</p>

Halligan was handpicked by President Trump to lead the office despite having no prior federal prosecution experience. The move is reportedly part of an effort to sideline prosecutors who might oppose politically charged cases. Cleary had previously voiced opposition to the Trump administration's decision to indict former FBI Director James Comey, adding to speculation about the motives behind her removal.</p>

          <h2>CDC Employees Experience Confusion After Firing Notices Are Abruptly Rescinded</h2>

          <p>Hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experienced a weekend of whiplash after receiving termination notices that were rescinded less than a day later without explanation. The botched layoffs created widespread confusion and anxiety among staff, many of whom were already furloughed due to the government shutdown. Critics suggest the chaotic process reflects ineptitude and may be part of a broader effort by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to consolidate power and sideline career scientists within the agency.</p>

          <p>The recently brokered Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange represents a significant diplomatic achievement for U.S. President Donald Trump, who celebrated the deal at a summit of world leaders in Egypt. This success builds upon the Abraham Accords from his first term and halts a devastating two-year conflict. However, while the immediate crisis is resolved, the long-term stability of the region remains uncertain. The next phases of the peace plan, which include the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza, present formidable challenges that will require sustained international pressure.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks recovered on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posting significant gains after a sharp plunge on Friday. The market rally was fueled by President Trump's more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China, which eased investor fears of an escalating tariff war. On Friday, markets had dropped sharply after the president announced a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports. However, his weekend comments suggesting that "all will be fine" helped restore confidence ahead of the upcoming corporate earnings season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Big Ten conference has fined the USC Trojans football program $5,000 for violating its rules on pregame availability reports. The fine was issued after coach Lincoln Riley played sophomore running back Bryan Jackson, who had been listed as "out" for the game against Michigan due to an injury. Riley defended the decision as a "wellness issue" made out of necessity after two other running backs suffered serious injuries during the game. Despite USC claiming it communicated with the league, the conference emphasized the critical need for accuracy in its reports.</p>
