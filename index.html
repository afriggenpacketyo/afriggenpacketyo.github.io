          <p>California and Texas are embroiled in a high-stakes political battle over congressional redistricting, which is expected to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Following Texas Republicans' move to redraw maps mid-decade to create five new GOP-leaning congressional seats, California Democrats responded by voting to adjust their own state's maps, aiming to boost Democratic representation by an equivalent five seats. This "political arms race" for partisan advantage, openly acknowledged by lawmakers, could spread to other states ahead of next year's national midterm elections. The legality of gerrymandering is complex, with critics arguing it allows politicians to choose their voters rather than the reverse, and concerns are raised about potential dilution of minority voting power in Texas.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Lucy Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and CEO of Passes, adheres to an intense daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, back-to-back gym sessions, and often no lunch breaks. The 30-year-old entrepreneur, who became a self-made billionaire after Meta's deal with Scale AI, attributes her success to a relentless work ethic and optimizing her time. She advocates for cutting out "wasteful" activities like "doom scrolling" to achieve work-life balance, even suggesting a 996-like schedule allows for social time. This article also notes a recent class-action lawsuit against Guo and Passes concerning alleged distribution of child sexual abuse material, which she denies as a "shakedown."</p>

          <p>Chinese defense researchers have developed a groundbreaking data link system for hypersonic combat, which scientists suggest could significantly outperform NATO's current military communications. This new network, engineered by the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, achieves time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, a performance two orders of magnitude better than NATO's Link 16 system. The innovation enables real-time, secure coordination between various hypersonic platforms, ground command centers, and intelligence networks, even at extreme speeds. Experts warn this could mark a strategic shift towards a networked strike ecosystem, potentially leaving Western militaries "time blind" and unable to react to coordinated hypersonic attacks.</p>

She had called for setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers following the Southport attack in July 2024, a post viewed 310,000 times before deletion. Connolly now claims she was "Sir Keir Starmer's political prisoner" and plans to meet members of Donald Trump's administration who are "big advocates for free speech." While she admits her tweet "wasn't my finest moment," this article highlights the ongoing debate on freedom of speech versus incitement to violence, and the complexities of political expression in the UK.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, spewing lava 100 feet into the air across its summit crater floor, marking its 31st such event since December. This highly active volcano continues to draw magma from deep within the earth, creating spectacular but contained displays within the Halemaumau Crater, posing no immediate threat to homes. Scientists monitor the volcano closely, noting the current pattern of repeated, fountaining eruptions is rare for Kilauea, with previous similar phases in 1959, 1969, and 1983. The eruption provides a unique opportunity for residents and visitors to witness nature's power, with park visitation increasing significantly due to the ongoing activity.</p>

Mission Viejo's defense, particularly against Santa Margarita's aggressive line, was praised for its "phenomenal job" in shutting down offensive drives.

Chinese firms raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong through 46 IPOs, compared to just $740.9 million from 16 listings in the US. This shift is driven by Hong Kong's more active capital market and the average 19.4% jump in new shares on their trading debuts, significantly outperforming US listings.

          <p>A new European study reveals that air pollution from oil and gas activities disproportionately affects people of color in the US, contributing to an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually. Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian Americans face higher risks from pollution across all stages of the oil and gas life cycle, from drilling to vehicle emissions. The study also links this pollution to 10,350 preterm births and 216,000 new childhood asthma cases yearly nationwide. California, particularly Los Angeles County, is identified as highly vulnerable.

          <p>Excel Parking, a car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing its second court appeal against a woman, Hannah Robinson, over parking charges. The firm had relentlessly pursued Robinson for thousands of pounds due to its controversial "five-minute payment rule," which was later banned by the private parking sector due to its unfairness. The district judge dismissed Excel's claims and found its litigation conduct "unreasonable and out of the norm," ordering the significant payment to the Access to Justice Foundation. This article highlights a notable victory for consumer rights against what was deemed an unfair parking policy and predatory legal action, encouraging others to challenge similar demands.</p>
