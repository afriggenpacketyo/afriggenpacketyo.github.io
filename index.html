          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 05:38:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United faces significant financial challenges if they fail to qualify for the Champions League, potentially impacting their transfer strategy and overall competitiveness. Missing out on Champions League football could lead to lower player wages and reduced attractiveness for potential signings. The club's debt hovers around £1 billion, and losses over the past five years total more than £370 million, necessitating staff redundancies and cost-cutting measures. Despite plans for a £2 billion stadium, financial constraints make it difficult to navigate back into contention at the top of the Premier League. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Growing economic risks and uncertainties are expected to keep gold prices high for the remainder of the year, driven by safe-haven demand amid Trump's tariff policies. First-quarter demand for gold reached its highest level since 2016, with central banks continuing net gold purchases for the 16th consecutive year. Analysts suggest that investors are turning to gold due to the erratic exercise of power by the US President, making the US dollar and dollar assets less reliable. The broader economic landscape remains difficult to predict, which could further increase the upside potential for gold.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will no longer be able to compete in women's football in England starting June 1. This decision follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. The FA stated that this change is due to a material change in law, science, or the operation of the policy in grassroots football. The FA is contacting registered transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can continue to stay involved in the game.</p>

He acknowledged the difficulty in reaching the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal due to inertia within the federal bureaucracy. Musk claims that achieving this goal requires political will in Congress and elsewhere, but remains optimistic about the possibility.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman's eye-scanning venture, Worldcoin, officially launched in the U.S. with six retail locations, aiming to create a global identity verification system using iris scans and blockchain. The process involves scanning a person's face and iris to create a unique "IrisCode," verifying they are human and haven't signed up before, in exchange for cryptocurrency. Visa will introduce the "World Visa card" exclusively for those who have their irises scanned, and Match Group will pilot World ID with Tinder in Japan. Concerns about data storage and privacy have been raised, but Worldcoin claims data is decentralized and impossible to reverse-engineer.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board asserts that the first 100 days of President Trump's second term have inflicted more damage on American democracy than any period since Reconstruction. The board argues that Trump is attempting to establish a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, posing a threat to constitutional checks and balances. The editorial urges a coalition of Americans across the political spectrum to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimate election and legal policies. The board highlights specific attacks on separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people.</p>

          <p>The Barkley Marathons, created by Lazarus Lake, is known as the world's most grueling footrace, testing the limits of human endurance in Tennessee's Frozen Head State Park. Runners endure shredded legs, separated clavicles, and exposed kneecaps as they navigate the off-trail course with over 68,000 feet of elevation gain. The race's secrecy and challenging conditions are part of its allure, pushing runners to their breaking points.

          <p>The Joint Office of Energy and Technology, established in 2021 to bridge the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy on electric vehicle initiatives, has been deeply affected by government-wide efforts to shrink the federal workforce. The office, once employing around 50 people, now has no full-time federal employees after rounds of resignations and project freezes related to climate change. The Joint Office was intended to facilitate collaboration between agencies and support the rollout of federally funded EV chargers, but the effort to slash jobs and the freezing of work related to climate change seems to have combined to push employees out the door.</p>

          <p>Stephen Colbert exposed President Trump's hypocrisy regarding the stock market, noting that Trump blamed President Biden for a recent market downturn, despite previously taking credit for stock market gains during Biden's presidency. Colbert satirized Trump's contradictory stance, suggesting it follows 'Freaky Friday' rules where Trump and Biden switch roles. The comedian's monologue underscored the inconsistency in Trump's approach to economic credit and blame.</p>
