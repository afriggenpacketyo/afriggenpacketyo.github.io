          <p>Teresa Reveles, the longtime housekeeper for the late fitness icon Richard Simmons, has publicly addressed their close relationship and the circumstances surrounding his death. In her first broadcast interview, Reveles denied rumors that she had kept him isolated, stating they were incredibly happy during his final decade away from the public eye. She explained that Simmons chose to retreat from fame because he wanted to be remembered in his prime, not as he aged. Reveles, who found him after his fatal fall, described him as peaceful and consistently happy throughout the 36 years she knew him.</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle, cast into the Atlantic Ocean by a Canadian couple in 2012, has been discovered on a beach in Ireland, roughly 2,000 miles away. Brad and Anita Squires, who were dating at the time, threw the bottle from Bell Island, Newfoundland, and have since married and had three children. The note was found by Kate and Jon Gay, who shared the discovery with a local conservation group, leading to a viral social media post that quickly reconnected the two couples. The find is being celebrated as a symbol of resilience and connection across the ocean.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Government Reports Unexpected Budget Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States Treasury Department announced an unexpected budget surplus of over $27 billion for June, a significant shift from the previous month's deficit. This positive fiscal result was largely driven by a substantial surge in customs duties, which increased by 301% compared to the same month last year, following new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite the monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt continue to be a major government expense, totaling $84 billion for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago federal court. Prosecutors allege Guzman Lopez was a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, overseeing a massive fentanyl trafficking operation. As part of the plea agreement, he must provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. His father is currently serving a life sentence, while his brother, also arrested, has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>Christina Block, the heiress to Germany's Block House steakhouse fortune, is on trial in Hamburg, accused of orchestrating the violent kidnapping of her two youngest children from their father in Denmark.

Block's defense claims she was a desperate mother acting to reclaim her children, who she alleges were wrongfully kept by their father after a visit. If convicted on charges including aggravated child abduction, she could face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports has caused significant backlash in the South American nation. President Trump explicitly linked the proposed economic measure to the ongoing criminal trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he defended as a victim of a "witch hunt." The Brazilian government, led by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, condemned the move as an unacceptable interference in its sovereign judicial affairs and promised a reciprocal response. This use of tariffs as a tool to influence another country's domestic politics has been criticized even by some of Bolsonaro's conservative allies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump toured central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that killed over 120 people and left more than 170 missing. The visit occurred as local and federal authorities face questions about the timeliness and adequacy of their response to the crisis, which was triggered when the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in under an hour. Unlike his reactions to other disasters, Trump has refrained from criticizing Texas officials, instead emphasizing his close relationship with Republican Governor Greg Abbott.

          <p>President Trump's recently signed "big beautiful bill" includes a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, but its phaseout mechanism could create a tax surprise for some high-income individuals. The benefit begins to decrease for those with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) between $500,000 and $600,000. Tax professionals warn this structure creates a "SALT torpedo," where the effective federal tax rate on income within that range could jump as high as 45.5%.

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure as the head of the UK's largest police force was marked by significant events, most notably the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. His leadership also faced intense scrutiny following the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by officers two weeks after the bombings. Lord Blair, who joined the police in 1974, stepped down in 2008 after losing the confidence of the newly elected mayor of London, Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Kehoe, has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave and inflation-adjusted minimum wage increases. The original measure, which passed via a ballot initiative just eight months ago, will be nullified on August 28. The repeal is a major victory for business groups who argued the law was burdensome, but a significant defeat for workers' rights advocates who spent years campaigning for it. Advocates have already submitted a new proposal to reinstate the benefits through a constitutional amendment, which would prevent the legislature from overturning it again.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in 15 regions across England will allow GP surgeries to offer patients support services, such as career coaching and exercise classes, to help them return to work more quickly. The initiative aims to reduce the number of people signed off on long-term "fit notes" by providing proactive assistance instead. The government stated that of 11 million fit notes issued last year, 93% simply declared people unfit for work without offering alternative support. The Royal College of GPs expressed support for the health benefits of work but cautioned that the scheme should not be punitive.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise new album titled "Swag," his first in four years, but the comeback has been met with a lukewarm response from music critics. Reviews have described the album as having "moments of brilliance" but ultimately not being a "masterpiece," with some calling it an "uncomfortable cry for help." The album moves away from pop towards an alternative R&B sound and includes spoken-word interludes addressing media scrutiny and his personal life. While some praise its nostalgic qualities, others criticize its lyrical clichés and artistic lethargy.</p>

However, Lowe provided evidence showing that he was still within the 28-day window required to register the funds after they were received in the inquiry's bank account. The commissioner concluded that no breach of the rules had occurred, and Lowe described the complaint as a "malicious attempt" to undermine his work.</p>
