          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to resume in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli airstrikes continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent strikes have resulted in dozens of Palestinian casualties, with the Israeli military reporting it has targeted over 100 Hamas sites in the last day. The talks are centered on a U.S.-led proposal for an initial truce, but significant disagreements remain. Hamas is demanding guarantees for a permanent end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel insists on being able to resume its military objective of dismantling the militant group.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match was temporarily stopped after the new electronic line-calling system failed to make a call on a crucial point. During the match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a ball that was visibly out was not called, forcing the chair umpire to halt play. After confirming the system was deactivated due to operator error, the umpire ordered the point to be replayed. A frustrated Pavlyuchenkova argued that the malfunction cost her the game, adding to the scrutiny the automated system has faced from several players during the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Military Experts Propose Structural Reforms to Counter Drone Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army have suggested that China's military needs structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. They propose the long-term goal of establishing specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid responses. This recommendation comes as drones have proven increasingly decisive in recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and clashes in the Middle East. In the short term, the experts advise integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare units.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow has released a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. The book delves into the complexities of the iconic American author, tracing his sardonic humor to a life rooted in pain and the fear of poverty. Chernow argues that Twain's insightful commentary on themes like politics, money, race, and corruption makes him remarkably relevant to contemporary America. The article highlights how Twain, through masterpieces like "Huckleberry Finn," remains a vital and thought-provoking presence in the nation's culture.</p>

          <p>Renowned filmmaker Ken Burns has described the proposed elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." The cuts, advanced by the Trump administration, are based on the claim that public media promotes partisan propaganda. Burns counters that PBS is a vital, non-partisan institution that provides essential services like children's programming, educational content, and emergency information, particularly for rural communities. He argues that defunding the system would harm a uniquely American institution that serves everyone from the bottom up.</p>

Beyond building places of worship, Turkey is investing heavily in railroads, ports, and hotels across the region and beyond. This projection of soft power is designed to further Turkey's economic, political, and military interests.</p>

          <p>A city council secretary from Apaseo el Grande, Mexico, was shot and killed while attending an amateur basketball game in a public sports hall. The attack took place in front of families and children in the state of Guanajuato, which has become Mexico's deadliest state due to violent turf wars between rival drug cartels. Local officials condemned the "treacherous, despicable, and cowardly attack" on their colleague. The violence is largely attributed to the conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has suggested that UK football clubs should contribute towards the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches. Arguing for a "polluter pays" approach, he questioned why local communities should bear the financial burden for security at large commercial sporting events. The proposal is part of his broader call for radical police reforms, including consolidating the UK's 43 police forces into 12 to 15 larger ones to make better use of overstretched funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece examines China's long-standing policy goal of rebalancing its economy toward domestic consumption, a pivot that has become more urgent amid weak global demand and geopolitical friction. However, the article argues that this transformation faces significant structural obstacles. High household savings rates persist, driven by a legacy of limited social safety nets and concerns over the costs of healthcare, education, and retirement. As a result, even as disposable income rises, it has yet to translate into the broad-based consumer confidence needed to fuel the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A merchant ship traveling through the Red Sea was set on fire after being attacked by armed assailants southwest of Hodeida, Yemen. Initial reports from maritime security firms described an attack by eight small boats, with a later report indicating the vessel was also struck by two bomb-carrying drone boats. Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, suspicion fell on Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have previously launched numerous attacks on commercial and military ships in the critical trade corridor. The use of drone boats marks a potential major escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old farmer in southern Turkey sustained serious injuries after being attacked by a lion that had escaped from a nearby zoo. The man was sleeping outdoors after watering his pistachio trees when the lion, named Zeus, pounced on him. The farmer reportedly fought with the animal before police arrived and scared it off by firing shots into the air. The lion was later located in a wooded area and killed, and an investigation into its escape has been launched.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country in the world to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The Taliban's foreign minister praised the decision as the beginning of a "new phase of positive relations." Analysts suggest Russia's motivations are both economic, aiming to use Afghanistan as a trade hub, and political, seeking to lead a bloc of autocratic nations in re-engaging with the Taliban. Human rights activists worry the move normalizes the Taliban's repressive policies, particularly against women.</p>

          <p>English football club Crystal Palace faces uncertainty over its participation in the Europa League due to UEFA's rules on multi-club ownership.

This complex situation highlights the growing complications and potential conflicts of interest arising from the increasingly popular multi-club ownership model in global football.</p>

The article reflects on how this narrative shift in wrestling may have been a bellwether for a broader cultural and political turn toward anti-heroism and gleeful malevolence in American society.</p>

          <p>This review analyzes "The King of Kings," a new animated film about the life of Jesus, based on a book by Charles Dickens. The film, which features a high-profile voice cast, aims to appeal to a broad audience beyond the Christian community. However, the reviewer finds that its on-the-nose evangelism, moments of awkward humor, and an overly solemn tone ultimately undermine this goal. The article concludes that while the movie may satisfy its core religious audience, it is unlikely to win over nonbelievers and feels like a missed opportunity for the genre.</p>

          <p>A report issued by the research services of the German parliament, the Bundestag, has cast significant doubt on the legal justification for recent Israeli and U.S. military strikes on Iran. According to the report, a majority of international law experts believe the actions do not meet the criteria for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The analysis argues that to be legally justified, Israel would need to prove an imminent threat of a nuclear attack from Iran, not merely the capability to develop a weapon. The German government has not yet formally responded to the report's findings.</p>
