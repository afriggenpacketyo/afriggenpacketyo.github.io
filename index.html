          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn, and U.S. stock futures faced renewed selling pressure following investor anxiety over the economic consequences of the Trump administration's recent tariff actions. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell sharply, with similar declines observed in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea. President Trump defended the tariffs, stating they were necessary to rectify trade imbalances, while administration officials maintained their stance despite market volatility, suggesting the tariffs would remain in place for the foreseeable future as part of a broader effort to reset global trade. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets suffered significant losses due to concerns surrounding President Trump's tariffs and the potential for a global trade war to instigate an economic slowdown or recession. Major indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo, Sydney, and Hong Kong all experienced sharp declines, with analysts describing the situation as a 'bloodbath.' The tariffs are expected to impact Asian countries heavily, as they manufacture a significant portion of goods sold globally, leading to revised recession forecasts from major Wall Street firms and highlighting the region's reliance on the U.S. as an export market. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs, investors are seeking safe-haven assets, with analysts pointing to the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as prime candidates. The yen is considered attractive due to its undervaluation and the anticipated narrowing of interest rate differentials with the U.S., while the Swiss franc is seen as another strong hedge. While both currencies have appreciated against the dollar, some strategists favor the franc due to uncertainties surrounding the Bank of Japan's rate hikes; bonds and gold are also seeing increased demand as investors seek lower-risk options. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent WHO report reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. The report warns that the UN's global target for reducing maternal deaths will be missed by a significant margin, as progress has stagnated, and leading health organizations caution that cuts to international aid by the US and UK governments risk reversing gains. These cuts are already affecting access to essential supplies, medicines, and healthcare workers, particularly in 60 countries dependent on US-funded maternal care programs. The report emphasizes the need for political commitment and financial investments to improve the quality of care and prevent preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in New York aims to prohibit police from conducting traffic stops for minor violations, such as a broken taillight or expired registration, to address racial equity concerns. The legislation seeks to reduce unnecessary stops, as data indicates racial minorities are disproportionately affected by arrests and traffic stops. Critics argue that the proposal is pro-criminal and undermines public safety by restricting law enforcement's ability to enforce traffic laws, while proponents contend that it will help limit racial bias in policing. The debate highlights differing perspectives on how to balance law enforcement effectiveness with concerns about racial profiling.</p>

          <p>Marine Le Pen's supporters rallied in Paris to protest her conviction for embezzling public funds and her ban from running for office, turning the event into a populist show of force. Le Pen and her protégé, Jordan Bardella, accused the French judiciary of political bias and attempting to silence the opposition, while counter-protesters warned against a "Trumpist turn" in France. The rally underscores the deep divisions within France over Le Pen's conviction and the broader issue of trust in the country's institutions, with the event serving as a platform to rally support and challenge the legitimacy of the legal system.</p>

Parents of a baby who died at a nursery are calling for stronger safeguarding measures, including more frequent inspections and CCTV checks, while a former Ofsted inspector claims that inspections are insufficient to identify poor practice and protect children.

          <p>Despite heightened trade tensions and President Trump's tariff impositions, China's central bank is opting for stability over devaluation, as evidenced by the yuan's daily reference rate remaining below the 7.2 benchmark against the US dollar.

          <p>President Trump defended his sweeping tariffs on imports, stating that "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," despite the shockwaves sent through global stock markets. Trump's top officials emphasized that the tariffs would be implemented as planned, downplaying recession fears. However, just hours after Trump's comments, stock markets plunged in Asia, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping significantly and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing more than 12%. Despite the turmoil, Trump maintained that jobs and investment would return to the US, making it "wealthy like never before."</p>

          <p>China's Central Huijin, a key state-run investor, has reportedly begun intervening in domestic stock markets to counter the panic unleashed by the US trade war, after Beijing signaled it had policy tools available to deal with Washington’s reciprocal tariff blitz. The market intervention was reported by Chinese state media, citing unnamed sources. The report drove up stock prices, narrowing losses in the domestic A-share market. Investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and UBS have predicted that China’s central bank is likely to announce rate cuts and heightened fiscal spending to shore up the economy in the near future. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Al Barile, the guitarist for the influential Boston hardcore band SS Decontrol, has died at the age of 63 after battling colon cancer. SS Decontrol was a key part of the straight-edge scene in the early 1980s, known for their short, furious songs railing against government, police, and organized religion. Barile formed SSD while a mechanical-engineering student at Northeastern University, and the band's music influenced the hardcore scene with its intensity and anti-establishment message. This year, SSD was inducted into the New England Music Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>Kenya is redesignating the Kakuma refugee camp, one of Africa’s largest, as a municipality, hoping to better integrate its 300,000 residents. This shift aims to reduce reliance on aid, which has faced recent cuts, and incorporate refugees more closely into local communities. The plan reflects a broader goal of assimilating refugees into Kenyan society, providing them with greater opportunities and self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said he’s “open to talking” to world leaders about new deals as he put a brave face on the chaos unleashed by his trade wars after a weekend playing golf at his exclusive Florida properties. Trump also claimed that he’d spoken to “many countries” and that despite fury abroad over his “Liberation Day” trade attacks, “They’re being very nice.” The confusion came against a backdrop of rising discomfort among some Republican lawmakers about the trade onslaught and as massive crowds across the country held anti-Trump protests in the largest show of dissent of his second term. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Universities in the US are under attack. While the Trump administration pretends to punish them for their alleged compliance with or support for “antisemitism” (ie pro-Gaza demonstrations) and “anti-white racism” (ie diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives), the real targets are academic freedom and freedom of speech. Going after the most prominent and privileged universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, kills two birds with one stone: it garners prime media attention and spreads fear among other, far less privileged universities.</p>

          <p>A second school-aged child has died in Texas from a measles-related illness, a hospital spokesperson confirmed Sunday. The child's death comes as an outbreak of measles originating in West Texas continues to spread. As of the latest CDC update on Friday, April 4, the U.S. has confirmed at least 607 measles cases so far this year, which is more than double the number of cases it saw in all of 2024. The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.&#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>
