          <p>Vance Boelter is facing federal and state charges, including first-degree murder, after allegedly killing a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, and wounding another lawmaker and his wife.

          <p>President Trump criticized former President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau for removing Russia from the G8 summit in 2014, arguing that this decision contributed to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Trump stated that Russia's inclusion in the G8 would have prevented the war, and he reiterated his belief that the conflict would not have occurred if he were president four years ago. The G7 summit in Canada is expected to focus on the Israel-Iran conflict and the war between Russia and Ukraine.

          <p>Payday loans, while seemingly a quick solution for financial emergencies, come with high fees and interest rates that can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. A $1,000 payday loan with a $15 fee per $100 borrowed can quickly escalate to $1,150 due in just two weeks, equating to a nearly 400% APR. Rollovers and additional fees can significantly increase the total cost, making it difficult to repay the original balance. It's important to explore safer alternatives to avoid the long-term consequences of payday loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Bruenig, a staff writer for The Atlantic, discusses her decision to witness state-sanctioned executions and her insights into mercy, faith, and the possibility of redemption. She explores the complex moral and ethical considerations surrounding capital punishment. The act of witnessing executions has prompted her to reflect on the meaning of mercy in the context of the justice system.
