          <p>UK strawberry growers are experiencing a "stonking start" to the 2025 season, with warmer days and cooler nights resulting in exceptionally sweet fruit. Marion Regan of Hugh Lowe Farms notes the strawberries are a good size and particularly sweet, attributing this to the ideal weather conditions. While drought concerns exist, farmers have irrigation systems in place. This contrasts sharply with 2024 when a wet winter delayed ripening, underscoring the impact of climate change on agriculture, making the current season a welcome change for both growers and consumers.</p>

          <p>Overnight Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip resulted in over 100 deaths, including many children and women, according to reports from hospitals and medics. The strikes have also forced the closure of the main hospital in northern Gaza, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. Israel claims the offensive is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages, while Hamas insists on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Mediators are attempting to broker a ceasefire deal, but significant obstacles remain, as the conflict continues to take a devastating toll on Palestinian civilians.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article raises concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to manipulate economic statistics for political gain. Proposed rule changes making it easier to fire civil servants could allow the White House to pressure statisticians into producing favorable data, undermining the impartiality of agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Such interference could damage the US's reputation as a reliable economic power and lead to policy errors. The article draws parallels to countries like Argentina and Greece, where data manipulation had dire consequences. The current administration's sensitivity to economic figures indicating a tariff-driven slowdown creates a potential spur to follow a similar path.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the US credit rating, citing rising government debt and a widening budget deficit. This move may lead to higher yields on US Treasuries, as investors could demand greater returns to compensate for the increased risk. While the immediate market impact is expected to be limited, the downgrade highlights growing concerns about the US's fiscal trajectory. The White House criticized the decision, while some investors argue that the US's ability to issue its own currency mitigates the risk of default. The downgrade may make investors more cautious about the US bond market.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet faces a record low approval rating of 27.4% amid growing dissatisfaction over economic policies, particularly the rejection of consumption tax cuts to address rising prices. The disapproval rating rose to 55.1%, with many respondents calling for a reduction or abolishment of consumption taxes to combat the cost-of-living crisis. The survey also revealed widespread concern over insufficient government efforts to control rising rice prices and skepticism about the outcome of Japan-U.S. tariff talks. These figures highlight the challenges facing the Ishiba administration ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is pushing forward with a new section of border wall in southern Arizona, threatening a crucial wildlife corridor. The construction will sever migration routes for various animals, including bears, mountain lions, and pronghorns, and the area has rarely seen people migrating. Conservationists criticize the project as an expensive and unnecessary environmental disaster. The move comes amid falling numbers of unauthorized border crossings and concerns about the militarization of public lands along the border.</p>

Experts suggest that these tariffs are particularly difficult for small businesses, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the near future.</p>

          <p>Boeing's new 777X will not feature engine chevrons, the shark-tooth-like structures on some jet engines designed to reduce noise. While chevrons disrupt exhaust to minimize sound, they also reduce engine thrust. The 777X utilizes General Electric's GE9X engines, incorporating new nozzle designs and ceramic matrix composites for heat resistance, resulting in a more compact exhaust stream and less friction. The GE9X also features a honeycomb architecture for acoustic disruption, making the 777X quieter and more fuel-efficient without sacrificing power.</p>
