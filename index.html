          <p>A New York Times article reports that water supply issues significantly hampered firefighting efforts during the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles. The city's main reservoir was offline for repairs, and plans to revive an old reservoir as a temporary solution were never completed due to safety concerns. As a result, firefighters faced water shortages and depleted tanks while battling the blaze. The article highlights that the inability to bring either reservoir back online undermined the potential water supply in the area and potentially exacerbated the destruction caused by the fire. </p>

          <p>An oil spill off the coast of Louisiana is raising alarm as experts warn that recent DOGE-related job cuts at NOAA may hamper response efforts.

The judge found that the order violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. The executive order sought to punish the firm for its representation of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and its hiring of a research firm that retained Christopher Steele. The judge characterized the order as retribution for the firm's work and Mr. Trump's grievances. </p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies found in the blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown promise in protecting against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Tim Friede has endured over 200 bites and 700 injections of venom from some of the world's deadliest snakes. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. </p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election, with President Trump's influence playing a significant role. The center-right Liberal-National Coalition, which had led in the polls, has seen its support plummet since Mr. Trump took office. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign has echoed Mr. Trump's messaging, focusing on the economy. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has refrained from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, the U.S. president's unpopularity among the Australian public seems to have boosted Albanese's chances. </p>

          <p>Army Capt. Braden Trent claims that the new 6.8x51mm XM7 service rifle suffers from reliability issues, excessive barrel wear, and breakages. Sig Sauer, the gun's manufacturer, has denied these assertions. Trent presented his findings at the Modern Day Marine exposition, arguing that the XM7 is "unfit" for its intended purpose. Sig Sauer maintains that the XM7 operates within safe pressure ranges and has undergone rigorous testing. </p>

          <h2>Man's Snake Venom Injections Lead to Potential 'Revolutionary' Antivenom</h2>

          <p>A man who injected himself with snake venom hundreds of times over nearly two decades has potentially revolutionized snakebite treatment. Immunologist Jacob Glanville discovered that Tim Friede, a self-taught snake expert, had developed immunity to several neurotoxins. Researchers isolated antibodies from Friede's blood and created an antivenom that protects against bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes in mice. The team is investigating whether additional antibodies might offer protection against the viperid family of snakes. </p>

          <h2>Trump's Hollow Defense of Tariffs</h2>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's attempts to defend his tariffs, which are causing economic pain for Americans. The article argues that Trump is a flawed messenger for this moment because he is unlikely to personally suffer much pain from rising prices. The article also criticizes Trump's advisers for lacking his ability to convince ordinary Americans he's just like them. The article concludes that Trump is inducing an entirely voluntary economic slowdown and asking voters to bear the brunt of it, but he doesn't give any indication that he feels their pain. </p>
