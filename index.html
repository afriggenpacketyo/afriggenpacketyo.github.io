        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Prime Minister and other political figures have criticized the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa due to safety concerns. West Midlands Police cited potential protests and previous incidents of violence and antisemitism as reasons for classifying the game as high risk, referencing clashes between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam in 2024. Critics argue that banning the fans is a form of antisemitism and that police should ensure the safety of all fans. The Jewish Leadership Council called the ban "perverse" and suggested playing the match behind closed doors, while a local MP supported the ban, citing safety risks. Optimism surrounding this decision is low considering the nature of the conflict. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index hit a fresh record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade talks with the U.S., while other Asia-Pacific markets experienced losses. The Kospi was the only market in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of 3,794.87. This bucked the trend of wider losses in Asia, which were influenced by concerns about the banking sector and trade tensions. The positive sentiment in South Korea was attributed to the ongoing trade negotiations, while other markets were weighed down by anxieties regarding regional banks and U.S.-China relations. The Kospi's performance reflects investor confidence in the potential for positive trade outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Alaskan coastal communities are recounting their experiences of fleeing their homes due to a severe storm surge caused by the remnants of Typhoon Halong. The storm brought record high water levels, washing away homes and prompting a large-scale evacuation effort to airlift over 1,000 residents to safety. Evacuees described houses being lifted off their foundations and entire villages being flooded, with some losing all their possessions and winter food supplies. The hardest-hit communities, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, experienced water levels more than 6 feet above the highest normal tide line, leading to the destruction of numerous homes and infrastructure. Despite the devastation, residents expressed gratitude for their safety and a determination to rebuild their lives. </p>

          <p>Former members of the military in the UK can now apply for a digital version of their identity cards, allowing them to more easily prove their status and access public services. The digital ID is stored in the government's One Login smartphone app and is optional, with physical cards still being issued. The government views the rollout as a test case for a broader digital ID scheme planned for all British citizens and residents by 2029. The digital veteran card will provide access to services like GP and mental health support, housing assistance, and discounts at museums and stores, simplifying the process for veterans to receive benefits. The optimism surrounding this is high as this is a positive change.</p>

          <p>A prominent biomedical scientist, Hu Ye, has left the United States for China after facing cuts to US$8.3 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Just months before his departure, he publicly commented on the impact of freezes and cuts to NIH funding. One of the affected grants was allocated for the early detection of tuberculosis and HIV in children. The optimism score is moderate due to the loss of a scientist. </p>

          <p>Alaska is conducting a large-scale airlift to evacuate hundreds of residents from coastal villages devastated by flooding caused by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.

One person was rescued, and two remain missing after a home was washed out to sea. The remoteness and scale of the destruction have posed challenges for rescue and resource efforts, with some communities still inaccessible.

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's order preventing the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The court found that the administration's decision likely violated the Tenth Amendment and that there was insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" in the state.

The decision maintains the current situation, where the federal government controls Guard troops but cannot deploy them within the state.

          <p>Venezuelan fishermen express fear for their safety after recent US strikes on boats in the Caribbean, part of a military operation targeting suspected "narco-terrorists." The US deployment of warships, fighter jets, and troops has heightened tensions in the region, leading to concerns among fishermen that they could be caught in the crossfire. Some fishermen fear being mistakenly targeted by US forces, while others worry about being recruited by drug and arms smugglers due to the economic downturn in the fishing industry. Despite the fear, some fishermen express defiance and support for the Maduro government. The optimism score is low due to the tense situation and the fear of violence. </p>
