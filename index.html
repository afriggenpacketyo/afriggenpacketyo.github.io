          <p>Hall of Famer Chipper Jones publicly criticized MLB umpire Doug Eddings for his performance during a recent Chicago Cubs and Detroit Tigers game. Jones took to X to express his dissatisfaction with Eddings' calls, claiming that Eddings missed several calls, including strike-three calls that should have been balls. Jones also stated that Eddings is one of the worst and most confrontational umpires in the league. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred says the league will propose an automated ball-strike challenge system for use in 2026, but Jones still expects better from Eddings in the meantime. </p>

          <p>Silver is presented as a potentially cost-effective alternative to gold for investors looking for stability and security in the current economy. The price of silver is on the rise, with analysts predicting further increases, making it an opportune time to invest. While silver offers diversification and inflation hedging similar to gold, investors should limit their precious metal investments to avoid overcrowding other income-producing assets in their portfolio. Experts generally recommend capping precious metals at 10% of the overall portfolio, divided between gold and silver. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports and its broadcast rights. The split will create one company focused on streaming and studios and another on global television networks, including TNT Sports. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups, suggesting that TNT Sports could consciously uncouple from the streaming service. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the future CEO of Global Networks, will decide how to monetize TNT's future streaming and digital sports rights, including potential licensing deals or a merger with another entity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles. This comment came before Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced they would sue Trump for deploying National Guard troops to address protests over those enforcement actions. The lawsuit argues that Trump's federalization of the California National Guard was unlawful and violates the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer.</p>

          <p>The transition to clean energy technologies, such as solar panels, batteries, and electric motors, is heavily reliant on critical minerals like lithium, copper, and cobalt. The demand for these minerals is expected to increase significantly by 2040, potentially leading to supply chain vulnerabilities. While the US is a major consumer of critical minerals, it is not a significant producer, prompting efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials and technologies to reduce the dependence on critical minerals, but these efforts will take time and investment.</p>
