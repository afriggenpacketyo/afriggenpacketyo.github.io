          <h2>Titans Select Cam Ward as Top Pick in Unpredictable 2025 NFL Draft</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 22:54:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 NFL Draft saw the Tennessee Titans selecting Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars made a surprising trade to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, intending to utilize him as a two-way player. Unlike the talent-heavy 2024 draft, this year's event was marked by unpredictability, with several linemen being chosen early and Shedeur Sanders's draft stock falling unexpectedly. The draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, emphasized the importance of offensive and defensive lines over quarterbacks, diverging from recent trends.</p>

The tea party will host about 50 veterans and their families, and a service of thanksgiving will be held at Westminster Abbey.

However, Manila's limited development capacity, upcoming midterm elections, and multinational companies' risk assessments may delay this conflict.

          <p>An open letter signed by over 170 organizations claims that supported housing, which helps vulnerable and disabled people live independently, is in crisis due to funding cuts and rising costs. Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, resulting in a shortfall of 325,000 places. The letter calls for increased funding for housing-related support and inclusion of supported homes in government housing plans. The government acknowledges the vital role of supported housing and is focused on building more homes.</p>
