          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 10:40:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has surprised observers with a notably defensive approach in recent Premier League matches, including a game against Arsenal where his team registered a record-low 34% possession. This tactical shift, which saw City playing with more defenders and focusing on counter-attacks, marks a radical departure from his signature possession-based style. Guardiola attributed the change to facing "one of the best teams in Europe," sparking debate over whether it reflects Arsenal's strength or a lack of trust in his squad's traditional play. This new strategy suggests a broader shift towards caution in top-tier football.</p>

This decision, which followed a request from the National Council for Human Rights and international pressure, will lead to his release from Wadi al-Natrun prison. Abdel Fattah, a prominent pro-democracy blogger, was arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news." His family, who campaigned tirelessly for his freedom, expressed immense relief at the news.</p>

The article details her appearance and activities, including carrying folders and headphones, following her interview with Justice Department lawyers where she denied involvement in sexual assault or witnessing nonconsensual acts. Concurrently, her former Manhattan townhouse has been listed for sale at $18 million. Maxwell, serving 20 years for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation, maintains her innocence and is appealing her sentence.</p>

Authorities identified the suspect as 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, a former employee, who faces a second-degree murder charge. While witnesses reported the suspect shouted "free Palestine," officials currently have no evidence indicating a hate-based motive.

          <p>China's soybean imports reached historically high levels in August, driven by massive purchases from Brazil and other South American countries. This strategic move is seen as Beijing's preparation for a prolonged trade standoff with the United States. Brazil accounted for over 85% of these imports, benefiting from a bumper crop. China has now recorded four consecutive months of record soybean imports, aiming to hedge against potential supply uncertainties from the US in the fourth quarter due to ongoing trade disputes.</p>

Nepal, strategically located between India and China, maintains a non-aligned foreign policy but faces increased engagement from the US and its allies.

Analysts are divided on whether this shift is a temporary fluctuation, possibly due to maintenance at Russian production sites, or a broader trend towards diversifying China's energy supply.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut, with potential for more reductions in 2025, is expected to diminish returns on savings accounts. Certified financial planners advise savers to consider locking in higher rates now, particularly through Certificates of Deposit (CDs). While online savings accounts still offer competitive yields, CD rates for durations extending into next year are currently available at 4%. This strategy can provide safe, conservative returns for those near retirement or seeking to minimize risk, though understanding CD terms and potential penalties for early withdrawal is crucial.

These swells pose a risk of "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions." Despite initial predictions for a busier season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far.</p>
