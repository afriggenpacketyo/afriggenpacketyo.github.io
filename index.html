          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reports that an Israeli military strike on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, has killed one of its workers and injured three others. The humanitarian organization described the attack as deliberate, stating the building was clearly marked with its protective emblem and its location was known to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has stated it is reviewing the incident. This event adds to the growing number of aid workers killed during the conflict, prompting calls from the UN for an independent investigation and accountability.</p>

U.S. officials have confirmed the death and are providing consular assistance to the family, condemning the "criminal violence by any party." The incident is the latest in a series of violent events in the West Bank, which has seen a rise in both settler attacks on Palestinians and Palestinian militant attacks on Israelis.

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore exhibits detailing Donald Trump's two impeachments at the National Museum for American History in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard referencing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears of historical whitewashing. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any pressure from the Trump administration, explaining the removal was due to the temporary label not meeting museum standards for presentation. The updated exhibit will be located in the section on the limits of presidential power, alongside materials related to the impeachments of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has indicated a high probability of subpoenaing former Vice President Kamala Harris to testify about former President Joe Biden's cognitive health. This development places Harris back in the national spotlight as she considers her political future after deciding not to run for governor of California. Legal experts suggest that while Harris is a logical witness for the investigation, compelling her testimony would likely face significant legal challenges based on executive privilege. The move is seen as a politically charged maneuver that could complicate any potential future presidential ambitions for Harris.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun its August recess without reaching an agreement to advance dozens of Donald Trump's stalled nominees, following a contentious standoff between Republicans and Democrats. President Trump publicly attacked Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as negotiations broke down, telling him to "GO TO HELL!" Democrats have been systematically blocking quick votes on nominees, forcing a lengthy procedural process for each one. In response, Republicans are now considering changing Senate rules in September to expedite confirmations, a move that Democrats warn would be a significant mistake and further erode bipartisanship.</p>

The development aims to replace aging infrastructure and accommodate growing air traffic, with the opening timed around the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the Trump administration's broad tariff strategy, explaining that the president views them as a tool for both economic and geopolitical leverage. Greer stated that tariffs are being used not only to address trade deficits but also to respond to issues like fentanyl trafficking and perceived threats to democracy in other nations, such as Brazil. He equated the use of tariffs to a lesser form of sanctions, arguing it is within the president's authority to use economic measures for foreign policy objectives. The administration is also in ongoing, positive discussions with China to avoid a significant tariff snapback.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a continued decline in its birth rate, which dropped to an average of 1.35 children per woman in 2024, prompting widespread societal concern. Sociologists attribute the trend to multiple overlapping crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and high inflation, which particularly affect the younger generation's decision to have children. The issue has become politically charged, with far-right parties advocating for higher birth rates over immigration. Experts argue the focus should be on closing the "fertility gap" by improving family-friendly policies, such as reliable child care, to support those who wish to have children but face economic and social barriers.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with the Met Office issuing an amber weather warning for most of Scotland due to expected strong winds and potential danger to life. The warning, effective Monday, anticipates gusts of 70 to 90 mph in exposed areas, posing a risk of damage to buildings and trees. A less severe yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. The storm's timing during the summer holiday season is considered unusual, prompting transport authorities to issue travel advisories and urge the public to plan ahead for significant disruptions to rail and ferry services.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for drivers who were mis-sold car loans with hidden commissions, which could cost between £9 billion and £18 billion. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large ones could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, but it anticipates that most eligible individuals could receive less than £950 in compensation. The regulator stated the court's decision provides clarity on what constitutes an unfair relationship between lenders and consumers, paving the way for payouts to begin next year.</p>

This attack is part of a broader Ukrainian strategy targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation for Moscow's ongoing bombardment of Ukraine.

          <p>In situations of marital instability where a prenuptial agreement is not in place, divorce attorneys suggest two key strategies for financial protection. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, which simplifies the process should a divorce occur. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that such agreements can provide security and clarity for both parties, preventing more significant conflicts later on.

          <p>Following a week of economic uncertainty fueled by a weak jobs report and shifting tariff policies, investors are now turning their attention to a new slate of corporate earnings. Key reports from companies like Disney, Eli Lilly, and Coterra Energy are expected to provide insights into consumer spending, the healthcare sector, and energy production. Beyond earnings, the market will continue to monitor the effects of new tariffs on international trade, with higher rates for several nations taking effect. The economic calendar is light, placing a heavy emphasis on corporate performance to set the market's direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently revealed that he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the number. Instead, Curry said he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and relationships that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to his financial team. Financial planners commented that this approach can be healthy, as it shifts focus from a potentially stressful obsession with accumulation to more tangible goals and values. They advise that tracking cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal goals can be a more powerful indicator of financial health than net worth alone.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after being struck by a boat on Saturday afternoon. The collision was forceful enough to nearly capsize the vessel and send a passenger overboard, though the person was safely recovered. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center responded to the incident but was unable to immediately access the whale's carcass, which came to rest on a shallow sandbar. Officials plan to tow the whale to a nearby state park on Monday to conduct a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death, advising boaters to use caution in the area.</p>

          <p>An American woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for facilitating a large-scale remote-work scam that funneled millions of dollars to North Korea. Chapman ran "laptop farms," helping North Korean IT workers pose as U.S. citizens to secure jobs at hundreds of American companies, including Fortune 500 firms. The scheme, which generated an estimated $17 million, exploited the rise of remote work to circumvent international sanctions and fund North Korea's weapons programs. Chapman pleaded guilty to wire fraud, identity theft, and money laundering, stating she was unaware of how to escape the operation.</p>

Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil defamation case against Ghislaine Maxwell can be unsealed.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the development of a new high-strength, low-temperature steel, CHSN01, essential for constructing nuclear fusion reactors. The material was created to address a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after previously prepared steel proved too brittle. This advanced steel is designed to withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium and the immense magnetic forces inside a fusion device. The successful development and deployment of this material in the world's first fusion power generation reactor this year places China in a leading position in advanced materials science.</p>
