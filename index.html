          <p>eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform that has expanded into crypto, has priced its IPO at $52 per share, raising nearly $310 million and valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. The company's Nasdaq debut, under the ticker symbol ETOR, will indicate the public market's appetite for risk following a period of tariff uncertainty that previously stalled IPO plans. BlackRock has expressed interest in purchasing $100 million in shares at the IPO price, and the funds will be used to expand the company's offerings and grow the userbase. Revenue from crypto assets has more than tripled in 2024, demonstrating the growing significance of the company's crypto business. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage demand from homebuyers has increased for the second consecutive week, driven by a rise in available homes for sale despite economic uncertainty and concerns over tariffs. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage application volume rose 1.1% last week, with purchase applications increasing by 2% and 18% higher than the previous year. This suggests that potential buyers are more motivated by the growing supply of homes than deterred by higher interest rates, which averaged 6.86% for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The increase in home inventory is supporting more transactions, providing additional properties for buyers.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley's focus has shifted from AI research to product development since OpenAI's release of ChatGPT, leading to concerns about safety testing. Experts say that tech companies are taking shortcuts in safety testing to stay competitive, sacrificing security for better chatbot responses. This means that newer models are less likely to reject malicious prompts, making them more vulnerable to exploitation. The changes are evident at Meta and Alphabet, which have deprioritized their AI research labs, and experts warn that companies are creating misaligned models with different goals than intended, leading to potential dangers.</p>

The potential lifting of sanctions could assist Arab states in preventing Iran from establishing a presence in Syria and align with U.S. interests in preventing Russia from building bases there, but it would require congressional approval.</p>

If childbirth becomes qualified for public coverage, a unified price will be set nationwide, though obstetricians have expressed concerns about the financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg is making a return to the Democratic spotlight with a series of appearances, including a town hall in Iowa, fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Without mentioning Trump by name, Buttigieg criticized the administration's efforts to cut the Department of Veterans Affairs and its handling of the country. He urged attendees to exert peaceful but energetic pressure on their representatives to block cuts to federal agencies and tax breaks for the wealthy, expressing optimism that people would resist Trump and restore faith in democracy.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility due to tariff policies is impacting college savers, but experts advise against panicking and selling investments prematurely. 529 plan popularity has soared, with accounts increasing to 17 million in 2024, and total investments rising to $525 billion, and college savings accounts are still vital as many students rethink their plans. Families can roll over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA and use funds for continuing education, apprenticeship programs, and student loan payments, and for parents worried about their account's recent performance, checking the asset allocation is crucial.

          <p>The article asserts that President Trump's actions and rhetoric demonstrate a disregard for the rule of law and the Constitution, subverting American democracy and undermining its role as a beacon of freedom. It argues that Trump's presidency has been marked by lawless aggression, persecuting enemies, favoring allies, and defying the Constitution, with a particular focus on attacks on the federal judiciary. The author contends that Trump's actions threaten the fundamental principles of American governance and its standing in the world, citing specific examples such as the attempted overturning of the 2020 election, attacks on the press, and defiance of court orders.</p>

The war's trajectory is as dependent on Israel as it is on Hamas, as Israel seeks either a temporary truce to free more of the hostages held in Gaza or a permanent deal that guarantees Hamas's defeat.</p>
