          <p>A federal court has blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, stating he overstepped his authority. The ruling, if upheld, would impact tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China, with investors reacting positively. Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's progress in Ukraine peace negotiations, but remains hesitant to impose new sanctions. American and European conservatives are convening in Hungary, viewing Viktor Orban's leadership as an inspirational model, although critics cite concerns about democratic institutions. The article also touches on maintaining friendships and a photographer's documentation of Indian American communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car manufacturing experienced a sharp decline last month, reaching its lowest April output in over 70 years due to US tariffs and Easter timing. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) cited the industry's shift to electric vehicles as a temporary factor. A federal court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, but not those on steel, aluminum, and cars, impacting British car makers like Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The SMMT reported a decrease in car production for exports, driven by reduced demand from the US and EU.</p>

          <p>A House Republican budget bill proposes a larger "pass-through" business tax break, potentially benefiting certain white-collar professionals. The QBI deduction applies to pass-through businesses reporting profits on individual tax returns. The House bill would change the phaseout calculation, potentially providing a bigger tax break for some SSTB owners. The deduction has been controversial because most benefits flow to taxpayers with high incomes.</p>
