          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad but has discussed enhanced cooperation with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. This meeting, held without advisors, focused on achieving mutual benefits akin to a merger without an acquisition. Following this news, CSX shares declined over 5%, while Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern also saw drops. The announcement comes after Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX recently partnered to improve coast-to-coast freight services.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for its tenth test flight following previous failures and a recent scrubbed launch due to a ground system issue. This milestone mission aims to validate corrective upgrades, with goals including testing the Super Heavy first stage during descent and sending the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory for an Indian Ocean splashdown. The article notes ongoing concerns about the rocket's readiness for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing, with some experts doubting the current architecture's viability. Despite these challenges, NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to innovate and meet future goals.</p>

          <p>A helicopter on a training flight experienced a catastrophic failure, "spiralling" out of the air before crashing in a field on the Isle of Wight. The tragic incident resulted in three fatalities and left one person seriously injured, who was airlifted to University Hospital Southampton. Four individuals were on board the Northumbria Helicopters aircraft, which had departed from Sandown Airport approximately 20 minutes prior. Emergency services coordinated a major response, and the Air Accident Investigation Branch is now examining the scene to determine the cause. The local community expressed profound shock at the event.</p>

While the risk to public health is currently low, this development raises concerns for the U.S. cattle industry, which faces potential economic losses exceeding $10.6 billion from an outbreak. Federal authorities are ramping up efforts to combat its northward spread, including plans to build a sterile fly production facility in Texas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of President Trump's actions in his second term, arguing they signal a systematic move away from the rule of law towards arbitrary personal rule. It cites instances like the FBI raid on critic John Bolton's home and the appointment of loyalists to key law enforcement positions, suggesting a pattern of using government power for retribution. The article contrasts the current environment with Trump's first term, where nonpartisan officials often resisted improper directives, and questions how America can reverse this perceived perversion of government. The author expresses concern that Trump is successfully reframing public understanding of law as merely a game of revenge.</p>

The article emphasizes that a higher growth rate typically warrants a higher multiple, while rising interest rates can lead to lower valuations as investors demand higher returns.
