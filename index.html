          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that "great progress" was made regarding the war in Ukraine following a "highly productive" meeting between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The talks occurred just days before a Trump-imposed deadline for a ceasefire agreement, with the White House indicating a willingness for Trump to meet both Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky. Despite the positive tone, the U.S. also imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for purchasing Russian oil, signaling continued pressure on Russia's allies.</p>

          <p>A zoo in Aalborg, Denmark, has generated significant online debate after posting on social media asking the public to donate surplus pets like rabbits and guinea pigs to be used as food for its predators. The zoo defended the practice, stating it is a responsible way to mimic the natural food chain and ensure the well-being of its carnivorous animals, such as the European lynx. While the zoo specified it does not accept cats or dogs, the use of the word "pets" caused an uproar among some commentators, though others applauded the zoo's practical approach to animal husbandry.</p>

          <p>A deadly and massive wildfire is sweeping through the Aude region in southern France, which Prime Minister François Bayrou has labeled a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale." The blaze, considered France's largest since 1949, has scorched an area larger than Paris, resulting in at least one death and injuring thirteen people. Over 2,150 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are battling the fire, which has been exacerbated by drought conditions, high temperatures, and strong winds. Officials have evacuated residents and warned that the fire could continue to rage for several more days.</p>

The investment aims to encourage more of Apple's supply chain partners to establish operations in the U.S., potentially helping the company mitigate the impact of tariffs on its products.

          <p>The recent resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler presents President Donald Trump with several strategic choices for filling the influential board seat. One possibility is appointing a "shadow chair" to serve for the short remainder of the term, potentially to challenge current Chair Jerome Powell's policies ahead of a future leadership change. This raises concerns about injecting political intrigue into the historically collegial institution. The article explores the potential candidates and the risks associated with politicizing the central bank's independent role in setting monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the cancellation of nearly $500 million in federal contracts for the development of mRNA vaccine technology, a move that has horrified many public health and biosecurity experts. The administration is terminating 22 contracts aimed at preparing for future viral threats, claiming the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses. Experts have called the decision baseless and dangerous, warning it leaves the nation vulnerable to future pandemics and bioterrorism threats. They argue it undermines a proven, life-saving technology in favor of older, less nimble alternatives.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have made their public debut at a Czech zoo, representing a hopeful step in a plan to reintroduce the species to the wild. The subspecies, which once roamed North Africa, has been extinct in the wild since the 1960s, with fewer than 200 individuals remaining in captivity. The three female cubs and one male were born as part of an international endangered species program. While significant obstacles remain, experts are in preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities about a potential reintroduction to a national park in the Atlas Mountains.</p>

          <p>Total credit card debt in the United States has reached a new record high of $1.21 trillion, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

To combat this growing debt, financial experts recommend several strategies, including debt consolidation loans to secure a lower interest rate and simplify payments. Other options include transferring balances to a 0% APR card or working with a credit counseling agency. (not investment advice)</p>

A court found her guilty of illegally channeling money to finance the "Shor" political party, which authorities view as a front for Russian election interference. The verdict comes as Moldova, which borders Ukraine, prepares for parliamentary elections and continues to navigate between closer ties with the West and Russian influence. The Kremlin condemned the ruling as politically motivated, while Gutul called it a "political reprisal."</p>

One study on the Maui fire found that one in five people sustained lung damage and nearly half showed symptoms of depression months later.
