          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in June, surpassing economists' predictions of 3.4%. Data from the Office for National Statistics also revealed that core inflation, which strips out volatile items like energy and food, increased to 3.7%. This higher-than-anticipated figure complicates the economic outlook and puts pressure on policymakers regarding future interest rate decisions. The data points to persistent inflationary pressures within the British economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A county government in China's Guangxi region has publicly admitted to plagiarism in its official forest fire prevention plan. The admission came after internet users discovered that portions of the document, including hydrological data, were nearly identical to a plan from another county located 400 kilometers away. Pingle county officials stated the claim was "essentially true" and blamed a third-party contractor for providing the plagiarized data. They have pledged to correct the document and implement stricter reviews for official publications.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on the Justice Department to release all "credible" information related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, passing the final decision to Attorney General Pam Bondi. This move comes amid growing pressure from his own supporters, who are demanding transparency and the release of an alleged client list. The article notes that a recent DOJ memo stated no such list exists, fueling conspiracy theories and creating divisions within the administration and the Republican party. The situation poses a political challenge for Trump as he navigates the demands of his base.</p>

          <p>Semiconductor equipment giant ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net bookings also coming in strong. However, the company's revenue guidance for the third quarter fell short of forecasts, and it warned of significant uncertainty for its 2026 outlook. CEO Christophe Fouquet cited ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical developments as reasons why the company cannot confirm growth for 2026 at this time. The mixed report reflects both the current robust demand for advanced chips and growing concerns about the future economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is ending the deployment for 2,000 of the 4,000 National Guard troops sent to Los Angeles to manage protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The deployment, which was ordered by President Trump against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been a source of significant political and legal conflict. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Newsom both applauded the withdrawal, framing it as a victory for peaceful protest and calling for the remaining troops to be sent home. The move comes amid ongoing legal challenges to the federal government's authority in the matter.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent shift to supply Ukraine with missile defense systems stems from financial persuasion rather than a change of heart regarding Russia. The author, Rafael Behr, posits that commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending and co-invest in Ukraine's resources have convinced Trump that supporting Kyiv is no longer a "rip-off." The analysis suggests Trump's foreign policy is transactional, viewing Europe as a better client than Russia, whose President Putin miscalculated by not accepting an earlier deal. The support is seen as a welcome relief for Ukraine but remains tenuous.</p>

The company, known for its "blind box" marketing, attributed the massive growth to increased global brand recognition, cost controls, and strong overseas sales, which accounted for nearly 40% of revenue in 2024. The popularity of its products, boosted by celebrity endorsements and a booming resale market, has solidified Pop Mart's position as a major global retailer with a stock market value of over $40 billion.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program in college athletics. This move aims to regulate the system that allows student-athletes to earn money from endorsements, which is currently governed by a patchwork of state laws. The action follows the advancement of the SCORE Act by a House subcommittee, a bill also intended to create federal oversight for NIL deals.

          <p>The murder trial has begun for James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors allege the 47-year-old was motivated by an affair with another dentist and financial difficulties, and that he administered a final fatal dose while she was in the hospital. The defense argues that the evidence is insufficient and suggested the victim, described as "broken" by her husband's infidelity, may have taken her own life. Craig has pleaded not guilty to murder and other related charges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to advance a Republican bill, backed by President Trump, that aims to cancel approximately $9 billion in previously approved federal spending. The measure, which advanced on a 51-50 procedural vote broken by the Vice President, targets foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans argue the cuts are a necessary step toward fiscal responsibility, while Democrats contend the move undermines the bipartisan appropriations process and harms crucial programs. The bill must pass a final Senate vote and then return to the House before a Friday deadline.</p>

The men, originally from countries like Cuba, Vietnam, and Yemen, were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to accept their return. This action is part of the Trump administration's expanded use of "third country" deportation agreements, a controversial policy that allows for removing non-citizens to nations other than their own.

The call for clarity comes as the Justice Department states no such list exists, fueling frustration among some Republicans and their supporters. Johnson expressed support for transparency and noted that other GOP lawmakers are calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress.

          <p>The White House issued an ultimatum to the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility, demanding they fire CEO Don Moul or be fired themselves. The board reportedly refused, defending Moul's performance. The move is speculated to be linked to President Trump's opposition to a proposed gas plant near the home of a celebrity supporter. However, sources cited in the article suggest the president's ultimate goal may be to install a more allied CEO to facilitate the privatization of the TVA, a long-held goal of some conservatives.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to an asset like the U.S. dollar. It explains how the proposed Genius Act, currently under consideration in Congress, aims to create a regulatory framework for these digital currencies, establishing consumer protections and clear rules for issuers. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper payments, while critics point to risks such as the potential for the digital currency to "depeg" from its underlying asset. The legislation is part of a broader push to integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system.</p>
