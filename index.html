          <p>Finland has been named the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, a title that even puzzles some Finns. The ranking, based on a life evaluation score rather than daily emotions like joy, is attributed to a strong sense of contentment among citizens. This contentment is fostered by a society with robust social support systems, free access to extensive public services like advanced libraries, and a deep cultural connection to nature and practices like saunas. The Finnish model suggests that societal well-being and contentment are key drivers of long-term happiness.</p>

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto moves through the Atlantic, forecasters are monitoring a nearby developing storm for a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While experts believe an interaction is unlikely due to the second system's weaker state, the possibility exists. The situation underscores the complex and sometimes unpredictable nature of storm systems during an active hurricane season.</p>

Speaking to Fox News Digital, Szijjártó highlighted close alignment on major political issues, such as Hungary's plan to follow the U.S. in declaring Antifa a terrorist organization. He also credited President Trump with strengthening NATO by pushing for increased defense spending and positioned him as the "only hope" for peace in the Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before taking his own life. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, noting that unspent shell casings found at the scene contained anti-ICE messages. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, fired from the rooftop of a nearby building. In response, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric and ordering increased security at facilities nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to protect federal facilities from what he termed "domestic terrorists." The announcement follows weeks of protests and clashes at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center in the city. The move has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accuse the administration of inciting violence and replaying tactics used during the 2020 protests. This order marks a significant escalation in the federal response to local demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold the remainder of its long-held stake in the company earlier this year. A BYD executive described the selling of stock as "completely normal" for an investment firm and expressed gratitude for the 17 years of support from Buffett and Charlie Munger. Berkshire's initial $232 million investment in 2008 grew to be worth billions, and the gradual sell-off began in 2022. Despite the amicable separation, BYD's stock has faced pressure amid signs of cooling growth in the competitive EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has died at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II at the age of 19. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, breaking racial barriers while serving with distinction. Hardy also served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, later becoming a champion for the legacy of his unit, which received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>A resilient stock market, which has reached successive new highs, appears to be propping up the U.S. economy by boosting consumer spending through the "wealth effect." Despite declining consumer sentiment overall, households with larger stock holdings report feeling more stable, which has helped sustain economic growth. However, economists warn that this strength could be precarious, as the top 10% of earners own 87% of the market. A significant downturn in stocks could quickly reverse consumer spending and, with minimal job growth, push the vulnerable economy into a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Ryan highlights the low cost of living, sense of safety, and a cultural focus on daily life rather than monetary pressures as key benefits.

          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), arguing the timing is now ideal for a transaction. After a previous activist campaign prompted CCO to sell its international assets, the company is now a more focused and attractive U.S. pure-play. Despite these strategic moves, CCO's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale to a strategic acquirer or private equity offers the best path forward for shareholders. Potential buyers have shown interest in the out-of-home advertising sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The company claims its process can reduce construction costs by up to 20% and cut delivery times in half compared to traditional on-site building. This method has already been utilized for disaster relief, with Fading West producing 82 homes for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires. By leveraging manufacturing efficiencies, the company hopes to make home ownership more attainable for a broader range of Americans, including essential workers in high-cost areas.</p>

          <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has voted to lift all sanctions on Russia and Belarus, which were imposed following the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The decision, made at the IPC's general assembly in Seoul, restores full membership rights to the National Paralympic Committees of both countries. This move could allow their athletes to compete under their own flags at the 2026 Winter Paralympics. Ukraine's Sports Minister strongly denounced the decision, calling it a betrayal of Olympic values, and stated that Ukraine's participation will be decided later.</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's recent economic statements reveals a mixed picture compared to his claims of universal improvement. While mortgage rates and gasoline prices have decreased since last year, his assertions that grocery and energy prices are down are incorrect, as both have seen increases. His claim to have "defeated" inflation is also inaccurate, with the annual rate at 2.9% and showing signs of re-acceleration. While the stock market has hit record highs, manufacturing employment has shrunk since he took office, presenting a more complex reality than the one portrayed by the administration.

May, who was a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus and resigned after his arrest, faces five to 20 years in prison on each of the five counts.
