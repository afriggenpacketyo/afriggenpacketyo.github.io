          <p>A news analysis by the New York Times suggests that the second Trump administration is disregarding ethical norms and legal boundaries, accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar and engaging in activities that blur the lines between public office and personal benefits. The article highlights examples such as the Trump family profiting from a meme cryptocurrency, auctioning access to the President, and pressuring law firms for donations. Furthermore, the administration has reportedly disbanded a Justice Department unit investigating cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This article argues that the current administration is openly leveraging the President's position for personal gain, raising concerns about corruption and abuse of power.</p>

          <p>An auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York showed signs of a cooling art market, with many objects presold and a lack of enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the lackluster sale to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While the collection totaled $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. A Mondrian painting failed to spark a bidding war due to its aggressive estimate, and a Warhol painting was withdrawn. The article suggests the art market is facing uncertainty due to financial market conditions.</p>

          <p>House Republicans proposed significant restrictions on the federal anti-hunger program known as food stamps (SNAP), aiming to limit its funding and benefits. The proposal would require states to contribute funding and force more beneficiaries to obtain employment. Critics argue that these moves could result in millions of low-income families losing access to aid. Republicans insist their approach would improve the program while defraying the cost of Trump's tax cuts. The article highlights the ongoing debates over federal nutrition assistance and the potential impact on vulnerable populations.</p>
