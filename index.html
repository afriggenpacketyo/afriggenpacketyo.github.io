          <p>President Trump is set to address the UN General Assembly, facing significant diplomatic isolation over the war in Gaza. Many key allies, including the UK, Canada, and France, are moving to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, a move the Trump administration strongly opposes and has described as counterproductive. The US has taken steps such as denying visas to the Palestinian delegation, further highlighting the divide between Washington and the international community on this issue. Trump is also expected to hold sideline meetings with leaders from Israel, Syria, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a controversial plan for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a project aimed at stimulating economic growth. The £2.2 billion privately-financed expansion involves converting the airport's northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the government touts the creation of thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local communities concerned about increased noise and carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>In an opinion article, a former spokesperson for Jill Biden alleges that the Biden White House was dominated by a bullying and loyalist culture that undermined Vice President Kamala Harris. The author claims that senior Biden aides were dismissive of Harris's capabilities and enabled a toxic environment, contrasting with the President's public persona of empathy and decency. This piece supports excerpts from Harris's forthcoming book, where she reportedly details the lack of support she received from the president's inner circle. The author suggests Harris is now pushing back against this treatment.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial conducted by Ascletis Pharma in the US has indicated that its drug candidate, ASC47, can significantly boost the weight loss effects of semaglutide, a popular ingredient in drugs like Ozempic. In a 28-participant study, the combination therapy resulted in a 56% greater relative reduction in body weight compared to using semaglutide alone. The company also reported that ASC47 substantially improved gastrointestinal tolerability, with the incidence of vomiting dropping from 57% with semaglutide monotherapy to just 6.7% with the combined treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many patients who qualify for hospital financial assistance are still receiving substantial medical bills due to significant loopholes in charity care programs. Even when a hospital grants 100% financial aid, services from independent contractors like anesthesiologists or radiologists working within the facility may not be covered by the policy. Furthermore, some nonprofit hospitals are narrowing their definition of "medically necessary" care, excluding more treatments from eligibility for financial assistance. This leaves vulnerable patients with unexpected debt, despite being approved for aid by the hospital itself.</p>

          <p>China has successfully built and tested the world's largest known radiation-proof robot, designed for maintenance tasks inside future nuclear fusion reactors, often called "artificial suns." The remote handling platform features three arms, with the main arm capable of lifting a 60-tonne payload with remarkable precision, positioning it accurately to within four millimeters. This advanced robotic system represents a significant step forward in China's pursuit of clean, near-limitless energy through nuclear fusion, surpassing the capabilities of existing robots used in the nuclear industry.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Republican party has shown a divided response, with some calling for forgiveness and others for political retribution. At his memorial, Kirk's widow, Erika, offered forgiveness to the alleged killer, echoing a message of Christian love over hate. In contrast, President Trump and other allies have framed Kirk as a martyr, blaming "radical-left lunatics" and vowing to dismantle left-wing networks. This rhetoric has escalated political tensions, with some officials calling for investigations into those who criticized Kirk online.</p>

          <p>Universities across the United States are laying off staff and reducing support services after the Trump administration abruptly halted funding for the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP).

The administration has criticized such programs as costly and ineffective, leaving participating schools and thousands of students in a state of uncertainty.

          <p>Sea moss, a type of red seaweed, has become a popular superfood on social media, with influencers and celebrities claiming it improves skin, digestion, and energy. However, dietitians and health experts caution that there is little scientific research in humans to support these widespread claims. While sea moss is a good source of fiber, antioxidants, and minerals, these nutrients are also available in many other foods. Experts also warn of potential risks, such as the accumulation of heavy metals from contaminated waters and excessive iodine intake, which can affect thyroid function.</p>

Moscow claims these "unlawful coercive measures" violate international rules and is seeking relief to maintain its aging aircraft.

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, the former UK Deputy Prime Minister, has criticized the current relationship between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump, calling it "slightly cringey" and embarrassing. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg argued that the UK government's "endless knee-bending" to the unpredictable US president is a miscalculation and that the UK will eventually have to choose between the US and the EU. He urged the prime minister to be more assertive in speaking up for British values and to avoid becoming too dependent on the US.</p>

          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has suggested that the global sports calendar may need to be re-engineered to address the challenges of climate change. Following the World Championships in Tokyo where athletes faced extreme heat and humidity, Coe stated that events like the marathon might need to be held at different times of the year or in different locations to protect athlete safety. Citing research that shows 70% of athletes feel climate change impacts their training and competition, he believes a collective rethinking of the international calendar is becoming inevitable.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent executive order imposing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B skilled worker visas has created significant uncertainty for US industries and Indian professionals. For decades, the H-1B program has been a vital pipeline of talent for the US tech and medical sectors, with Indians making up over 70% of recipients. Experts argue the new fee is unworkable, as the median salary for new H-1B employees is less than the fee itself. The policy could lead to labor shortages in the US, force companies to offshore more work, and diminish the appeal of American universities for international students.</p>
