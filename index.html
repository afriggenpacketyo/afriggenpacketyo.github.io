          <p>The Philadelphia Zoo is celebrating the birth of four Galapagos tortoise hatchlings, a first in its 150-year history, with the parents being nearly 100 years old. The zoo announced that the hatchlings are healthy and being monitored behind the scenes, weighing approximately 70-80 grams each. Mommy, the female tortoise, is genetically valuable and considered the oldest first-time mom of her species. The zoo plans a public debut on April 23, including a naming contest, with the hopes that these hatchlings will contribute to the thriving population of Galapagos tortoises in the next century.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations dubbed "Hands Off!" took place across the United States, organized by over 150 groups protesting President Trump's administration and Elon Musk's role in government downsizing.

The state insists it already complies with federal civil rights laws and views the administration's legal interpretation as faulty.

          <p>The article explores the viral morning routine of fitness influencer Ashton Hall and its implications for modern masculinity. Hall's rigid schedule, involving early wake-ups, ice baths, and intense workouts, has sparked debate about the pressures of male self-optimization. While seemingly benign, the content reinforces regressive ideas about masculinity, positioning men at the center of the universe and promoting a puritanical lifestyle. The author argues that such content, though less overtly misogynistic than that of influencers like Andrew Tate, subtly shifts culture towards a more palatable form of patriarchy.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula behind President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff plan, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and results in inflated tariff rates. The formula, which divides a country's trade deficit with the U.S. by its exports and then by two, assumes an elasticity rate lower than it should be in practice. If elasticity is adjusted, tariff rates would be significantly lower, with most countries at the baseline rate. Another report also found that trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in reality.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian dismissed Shahram Dabiri, his deputy, for taking a "lavish" trip to Antarctica with his wife during Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The president's office deemed the trip "unjustifiable and unacceptable" given Iran's economic challenges. The decision came after a photo of Dabiri and his wife in front of the MV Plancius, bound for Antarctica, circulated widely on social media, causing public outrage. Pezeshkian emphasized the importance of simplicity for those in positions of authority, particularly amid economic pressures on the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that Republicans risk a "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if President Trump's tariffs trigger a recession. Cruz warned that the tariffs could lead to a trade war, destroying jobs and damaging the U.S. economy. He emphasized the potential for a Democrat-controlled House and Senate if the economy suffers. Cruz expressed hope for success but defined it as dramatically lower tariffs abroad and at home, benefiting American workers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Empty nesters are being encouraged to consider foster care, as they are "not too old" to make a significant difference in children's lives. Parents who started fostering after their children left home share that they have a "huge amount to offer." This call comes amidst a decline in the number of foster carers, prompting the children's minister to urge empty nesters to consider fostering. Existing foster carers emphasize the rewarding nature of providing a loving and secure home for children in need, regardless of age.</p>

          <p>Michigan has joined 18 other states in a lawsuit challenging President Trump's election order, arguing it is an unconstitutional invasion of states' authority to run their own elections. The lawsuit seeks to block key aspects of the order, including requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and demanding that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. Democratic officials argue the order is antidemocratic and un-American, while the White House defends the proof-of-citizenship requirements as "common sense."</p>

          <h2>Trump Tariff Formula Misrepresents Global Trade Economics, Experts Assert</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic experts are criticizing President Trump's formula for calculating tariffs, stating that it misrepresents global trade economics and is not based on any modern definition of trade deficits. The formula, which involves dividing a nation's trade deficit by its imports and then halving the result, does not align with established economic principles. Critics argue that trade deficits are influenced by financial markets, not solely by demand for imports and manufacturing. The approach is unlikely to achieve the administration's desired outcomes and deviates from established international trade policies.</p>
