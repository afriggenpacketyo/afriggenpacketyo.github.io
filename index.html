          <p>President Trump has condemned President Putin's escalation of attacks on Ukraine, calling it "absolutely crazy." Trump expressed disappointment and surprise at Putin's actions, especially given ongoing negotiations for a cease-fire.

Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for his remarks, stating that Zelenskyy's words were causing problems. The Kremlin responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's efforts in pressing negotiations. Optimism surrounding the conflict has waned.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move perceived as underscoring Canada's sovereignty in response to President Trump's suggestions of annexation. Prime Minister Carney invited Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, highlighting Canada's distinct national identity. Carney aims to showcase the differences between Canada and the United States, emphasizing Canada's constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. While Canadians are generally indifferent to the monarchy, the visit is intended to send a clear message about Canada's independence, though the new U.S. ambassador suggests such gestures are unnecessary.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has downplayed an incident in which his wife, Brigitte, appeared to push his face away upon arrival in Vietnam. Video footage showed Brigitte Macron's hands on her husband's face, leading to speculation about the interaction. Macron explained that they were joking around, dismissing reports as overblown. The incident occurred as Macron began a Southeast Asian tour to promote France as an alternative to the U.S. and China amid trade tensions.</p>

He expressed hope that the U.S. Supreme Court and other "good and compassionate" judges will step in to save America. The message comes ahead of Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation is diverse and develops during puberty through an interplay of biological and psychosocial factors. Experts say no one chooses their sexual orientation, and it remains stable throughout life. Sexual orientation is not hereditary, but a complex interplay of biological and social factors is responsible for its development. There is no scientific basis for considering any sexual orientation a disease or unnatural, and societal norms determine what is tolerated or considered normal.</p>
