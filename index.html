          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed employee concerns over increased in-office requirements and changes to sabbatical benefits, stating the changes are a risk the company decided to take to improve collaboration, innovation, and company culture. Khosrowshahi emphasized the need for Uber to be at its "A game" as a "Gen-AI powered company," prioritizing learning and impact over benefits. He denied that the policy changes were intended to drive attrition or layoffs, highlighting the company's strong financial performance. Uber's first-quarter financial results are due soon, with analysts closely watching to see how the changes have impacted the company's bottom line.</p>

          <p>Tesla's Shanghai factory experienced a significant drop in deliveries in April, signaling increasing challenges for the U.S. carmaker in China's competitive electric vehicle market. Deliveries of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles fell 25.8% from March and 6% year-over-year, as Chinese rivals introduce cheaper, tech-laden models that are attracting consumers. This decline follows a first-quarter slump in deliveries, marking the lowest level in three years. Analysts suggest Tesla's hopes for a sustained rebound in China are fading due to the aggressive pricing strategies and innovative models of its domestic competitors.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings exceeded analyst predictions, but revenue fell short of expectations, leading to a drop in the company's stock price. Despite the revenue miss, Uber reported a significant increase in net income and growth in bookings for both its ride-hailing and delivery services. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted the company's push into autonomous vehicles (AVs), viewing it as the "single greatest opportunity ahead for Uber." The company has formed partnerships with Waymo and other AV companies, and is already offering robotaxi rides and autonomous delivery in select U.S. markets.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, faces significant challenges in tackling climate change. Despite committing to climate neutrality by 2045, experts suggest that environmental protection is not a high priority for the incoming coalition. Domestic and international climate policy will be moved back under the environment ministry, potentially leading to conflicts with economic priorities. Achieving Germany's emissions reduction targets will require significant improvements in the building and energy sectors and international climate leadership.</p>

          <p>The cost of providing accommodation for asylum seekers in the UK is set to triple, according to the National Audit Office. Contracts signed in 2019 were initially estimated at Â£4.5bn over ten years but are now projected to reach Â£15.3bn. The rising costs are primarily driven by an increase in the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels.
