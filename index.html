        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it would slow its reduction of government bond purchases starting April of next year, while maintaining the benchmark rate at 0.5%. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and reflects concerns about rising growth risks in Japan's economy. The central bank plans to decrease monthly bond purchases by approximately 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, targeting a monthly purchase amount of around 2 trillion yen. Japan's economic growth faces uncertainty, and inflation has exceeded the BOJ's target for about three years, but the bank expects accommodative financial conditions to provide support.

          <p>Families are grieving as officials begin handing over the remains of victims from the Air India Express flight that crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad. The process of identifying bodies through DNA matching is slow and painstaking, taking between 48 to 72 hours per victim, with only 22 bodies identified as of Sunday evening. The plane, a Boeing 787 bound for London, struck a medical college hostel in a residential area, resulting in the deaths of 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. The Indian government has established a high-level committee to investigate the causes of the crash and formulate procedures to prevent future aircraft emergencies.</p>

          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting with assets tied to specific economies. Concerns over fiscal sustainability and ongoing wars have fueled demand for gold as a reliable store of value. While the dollar index has weakened and Treasury yields have decreased, gold prices have consistently reached new highs.</p>
