          <p>Following his high-stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an interview with Sean Hannity. He emphasized that while no final deal was reached to end the war in Ukraine, significant progress was made, and he believes Putin is open to peace. Trump rated the meeting a "10 out of 10" for rapport, suggested a future trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and stated his advice to Zelenskyy would be to "make a deal." He declined to specify the remaining sticking points but indicated the next steps are up to Ukraine and European nations.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. While the storm is not currently expected to make landfall in the United States, the National Hurricane Center is urging Caribbean islands to monitor its path closely. The storm is projected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, bringing heavy rainfall and the risk of flash floods and mudslides.

          <p>A significant data breach at a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor, Inflite The Jet Centre, has exposed the personal information of up to 3,700 Afghans who were resettled in the UK. The compromised data includes names, passport details, and reference numbers for the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) scheme for those who worked with British forces. This incident follows a separate, major breach in 2022 that affected nearly 19,000 applicants. While the government stated there is no evidence the data has been publicly released or posed a threat, critics called the breach "astonishing" and "deeply embarrassing."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 22:16:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a concrete deal to end the war in Ukraine, leaving allies guessing about what was discussed. Trump offered few specifics, stating "no deal until there’s a deal," while Putin hinted at behind-the-scenes agreements and reiterated demands that Ukraine should essentially be part of Russia. Analysts suggest the meeting was a strategic victory for Putin, who gained international legitimacy from the high-profile event on US soil without making any tangible concessions. The lack of clear deliverables or a path forward left the impression of a summit that accomplished little for US or Ukrainian interests.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit filed by Washington D.C., the Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). An emergency court hearing led to a revised directive where MPD Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, rather than the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The DEA administrator will now act as an intermediary, and the agreement still allows the federal government to direct the MPD for certain purposes, including assisting with immigration enforcement. The city's attorney general expressed that the key issue of command and control has been resolved for now.</p>

The report states he simply walked out after a tower guard unlocked a gate without confirming his identity, highlighting significant procedural failures that led to two employees being fired. After his capture, Hardin was moved to a maximum-security facility. He had previously pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and two counts of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin concluded without a ceasefire or any tangible agreement, leaving observers to interpret vague statements about "great progress." For Trump, who prides himself on dealmaking, the outcome appears to be a setback, as he left Alaska empty-handed after promising a high chance of success. From a Russian perspective, Putin secured a high-profile meeting on the world stage, treating him as an honored guest without having to concede on his war in Ukraine. The lack of a clear path forward raises questions about whether Trump will now follow through on previous threats of sanctions against Russia.</p>

This development comes a year after the city passed a landmark law to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this ADU, located near the city's downtown, will serve as a model for other cities and become a new form of starter home amid the state's housing crisis. ADUs, or "granny flats," now account for approximately one-fifth of California's new housing growth.</p>

The plaintiff claims this practice violates privacy and wiretap laws, as confidential information is captured and used for Otter's financial gain. The lawsuit also raises doubts about the effectiveness of the company's process for "de-identifying" user data before using it for AI training.</p>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the sea have been the focus of efforts to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. Researchers now suggest that since pollution comes from numerous sources like agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads, a more effective public health strategy would be to focus on exposure control, such as improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global bubble tea market is booming, with projected growth to nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, leading three major Chinese chains to list publicly in Hong Kong this year. Companies like Mixue Group, which now has more stores than McDonald's, are expanding rapidly through a franchise-heavy model that relies on selling ingredients and equipment to store owners. While this strategy fuels fast growth and attracts investors looking for consumer-focused sectors, it also raises challenges. Market saturation, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control are testing whether the industry can sustain its growth or if it is just a passing fad.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major political maneuver, California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps for partisan advantage. The proposal, which would require voter approval in a special election, aims to give Democrats up to five additional U.S. House seats. This move is a direct response to Republican-led efforts in states like Texas to gerrymander districts in their favor at the urging of President Trump. The proposed California map would consolidate Republican voters into fewer districts and shore up vulnerable Democratic incumbents, potentially reshaping the state's political landscape and influencing control of Congress.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator at Anfield. The referee, Anthony Taylor, stopped play for four minutes to address the situation with both managers and team captains, and an anti-discrimination message was read at halftime. Despite the incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals in the second half. The Football Association and Liverpool FC have condemned the act and an investigation is underway, with the incident serving as a stark reminder of the ongoing issue of racism in football.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok about authoritarian repression was censored, and its Burmese curator forced to flee the country, after complaints from the Chinese government. The artist, Sai, alleges that Chinese embassy officials visited the gallery and demanded the removal of works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists, which they claimed promoted independence. The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre partially complied, covering artists' names and references to the regions with black paint. Fearing for his safety, Sai and his wife fled to the UK to seek asylum, in what human rights advocates are calling a clear case of transnational repression.</p>

With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is targeting the price-conscious consumer, a key demographic in the EV market. However, the recent rollback of federal EV tax credits may challenge its sub-$20,000 price point, pitting it against more feature-rich competitors.</p>

While Celtic has made some summer signings, the team still appears short in key areas, particularly at winger, striker, and left-back cover. Rodgers has previously voiced frustration with the lack of movement but noted that the window remains open for another two weeks.</p>
