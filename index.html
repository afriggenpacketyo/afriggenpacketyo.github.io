          <p>President Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine. Ahead of the summit, Trump stated he would walk away if the talks do not go well, emphasizing that the U.S. is in a strong economic position. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope for a strong U.S. stance, noting that Russia continues its attacks even as negotiations are set to begin. The meeting's primary goal is to establish a framework for ending the conflict, with Trump suggesting it could set the stage for a subsequent meeting that includes Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 season, posing a significant test for the nation's hurricane preparedness. While currently projected to curve away from the U.S. mainland, it is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and create dangerous surf conditions along the East Coast. The article notes that forecasters anticipate an unusually active season, partly due to warm Atlantic temperatures and neutral El Niño conditions. It also raises concerns that budget cuts to agencies like NOAA could undermine forecasting accuracy and disaster response capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as essential for U.S. national security. The argument is that government support is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This move would align with President Trump's goal of increasing high-end technology production within the United States. The potential intervention has already caused a significant surge in Intel's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The supermarket chain Iceland is introducing a new initiative to combat rising retail theft by offering customers a £1 credit for reporting shoplifters. The company's executive chairman stated that shoplifting costs the business approximately £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in staff. The move comes as shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest levels since 2002. Iceland has clarified that customers should not confront suspected thieves but should instead alert a staff member to receive the reward.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has initiated an investigation into Meta following reports that the company's internal policies permitted AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. The probe will examine whether Meta's AI products facilitated child exploitation and if the company misled the public about its safeguards. In a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Hawley demanded internal documents related to the chatbot policies. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the documents but claimed they do not accurately reflect the company's prohibitive policies, which have since been clarified.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are prioritizing the repayment of credit card debt, which has collectively surpassed $1.21 trillion amidst interest rates averaging close to 22%. The financial burden is compounded for the 45% of adults who carry balances on multiple cards, making repayment more complex. The article outlines several strategies for tackling this debt, including debt forgiveness programs, debt management plans through credit counseling, and debt consolidation via loans or balance transfer cards.

          <p>This literary piece reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, prompted by a recent review of a new biography. The author delves into Spark's most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," exploring its themes of adolescent development, moral education, and the powerful influence of a magnetic teacher on young minds. The story is told through the eyes of the students, particularly Sandy, whose journey into adulthood and conversion to Catholicism is framed by her complex relationship with her former mentor. The article celebrates Spark's realistic portrayal of how formative figures can leave an indelible mark on a person's life.</p>

Experts suggest Putin aims to secure U.S. pressure on Ukraine to cede territory, discontinue American financial support, and accept a peace deal on Russian terms. Conversely, Ukraine seeks a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from its sovereign territory and refuses to make territorial concessions. European allies remain wary of the summit, concerned that Trump might be swayed by Putin's proposals, potentially undermining Ukraine's position and long-term European security.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly altered the U.S. foreign policy process, shifting major national-security decisions away from the traditional National Security Council to a small, core group of loyal advisers. This inner circle, which includes Vice President J. D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, now handles critical issues like the war in Ukraine, reflecting Trump's mistrust of the larger bureaucracy. This centralized approach allows for more nimble decision-making aligned with the president's instincts but also increases the risk of unintended consequences by limiting expert input and debate. The upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin is cited as a key example of this new, more personalized approach to global statecraft.</p>

Critics claim the report contains numerous inaccuracies and misrepresents peer-reviewed research to downplay the risks of greenhouse gas emissions.

          <h2>Swarm of Over 130 Minor Earthquakes Shakes Northern California Geothermal Field</h2>

          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, centered in the Geysers geothermal steam field across Sonoma and Lake counties. The largest tremor registered a magnitude of 4.0, but most were significantly smaller. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are common in this area and are induced by the operations of the geothermal power facility located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity causes contractions and stresses in the surrounding rock, leading to frequent minor seismic activity.</p>

          <p>In the days leading up to the summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russian forces have made tactical gains in Ukraine's Donetsk region, breaching defensive lines in some areas. While these advances are currently limited, they represent a dangerous moment for Ukraine and are seen as an attempt by Moscow to strengthen its negotiating position. The infiltrations are focused on exploiting Ukrainian troop shortages, particularly around the key city of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested the offensive was timed to create an information backdrop suggesting Russia is gaining ground ahead of the high-stakes talks in Alaska.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's order that placed restrictions on its immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. The injunction, issued by a federal judge, prohibits law enforcement from stopping or detaining individuals based solely on factors like their race, their use of the Spanish language, or their presence at day-laborer sites. While the order allows these factors to be considered in conjunction with other evidence, it has reportedly led to a significant reduction in immigration arrests. The case raises questions about the extent to which courts can impose broad restrictions on law enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece advocates for the U.S. State Department to formally designate the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates, such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), as terrorist organizations. The author argues that for too long, the U.S. has viewed the Brotherhood with a "dangerous combination of naiveté," ignoring its role as the ideological source of modern Sunni Islamism and its direct links to groups like Hamas. The article asserts that failing to designate these groups allows them to operate freely and fund extremism under the guise of cultural or civil rights advocacy. It calls for the Trump administration to follow through on previous considerations and align U.S. policy with that of allies like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>U.S. shoppers are continuing to purchase jewelry at a strong pace, providing a bright spot for brands like Pandora amid weaker sales in Europe and China. Pandora's CEO noted that the U.S. market, which saw an 8% rise in like-for-like sales, is "bucking the trend" of a global slowdown. This trend is also visible in the luxury sector, with Richemont, owner of Cartier, reporting a 17% jump in American sales. However, jewelry brands face challenges from potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising costs of materials like silver and gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), leaving only about 200 staff members. The 2-1 decision vacates a lower court's injunction that had previously blocked the workforce reduction. The administration has stated its goal is to create a "more streamlined" bureau, but critics and the employees' union argue the cuts will make it impossible for the agency to perform its legally mandated duties to protect consumers. The ruling is a significant step in the administration's effort to dismantle the agency created after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>Tensions in Washington, D.C., have intensified as local officials challenge the Trump administration's attempt to assume full control of the city's police force. After the U.S. Attorney General appointed the head of the DEA to oversee the department, D.C.'s Attorney General filed a federal lawsuit to block the move, calling it an unlawful assertion of authority that threatens public safety. The conflict began when President Trump invoked an emergency declaration to federalize the police, citing crime rates that local data shows have actually reached a 30-year low. Experts warn the confusion over command could create a dangerous and unprecedented situation.</p>

In a message, the King paid tribute to the courage and sacrifice of the "Forgotten Army," acknowledging the horrific conditions they faced. The service included wreath-layings, a two-minute silence, and a flypast by the Red Arrows and WWII-era aircraft to commemorate the estimated 71,000 UK and Commonwealth soldiers who died fighting Japan.</p>
