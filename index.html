          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated that the time has come to advance a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, which has strong bipartisan support. The legislation, which would place a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian energy, has been repeatedly delayed due to other geopolitical events and White House requests for more presidential flexibility. With 85 co-sponsors, the bill's passage in the Senate is nearly guaranteed once a vote is scheduled. This renewed push comes as President Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin and ahead of a planned White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, highlighting the complex diplomatic landscape.</p>

          <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, fell in a Capitol hallway on Thursday but was able to get up with assistance and continue with his legislative duties. The incident occurred as he was approached by environmental advocates while on his way to a series of votes related to the ongoing government shutdown. This event raises further questions about his health, following a more serious fall in 2023 that led to a prolonged absence from the Senate. McConnell, who has already announced he will not seek reelection and has stepped down from his leadership role, plans to serve out the remainder of his term until January 2027.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Maryland are reportedly preparing to seek a grand jury indictment against John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Trump, for his alleged mishandling of classified documents. This action follows recent indictments of other Trump critics, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, fueling accusations of political retribution. The investigation into Bolton centers on classified information allegedly included in his 2019 memoir, "The Room Where It Happened." Bolton has consistently denied any wrongdoing, stating he never unlawfully removed or published classified materials from his time in government service.</p>

Motivated by what she describes as a 'broken system' she witnessed during the search for her daughter, Cantu-Castle aims to address systemic failures and restore faith in government for her South Texas community. Her platform focuses on people over politics, emphasizing education, small businesses, and increasing voter engagement in a historically overlooked region. She is also advocating for the construction of a long-promised VA hospital to serve the area's large veteran population.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a billionaire Democrat, disclosed winning $1.4 million from playing blackjack during a single vacation trip to Las Vegas last year. The governor described the win as a result of being 'incredibly lucky' during a press conference following the release of his 2024 tax returns. These filings showed a total income of nearly $10.7 million for Pritzker and his wife. A campaign aide has stated that the governor, who is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, intends to donate the entirety of his gambling winnings to charity.</p>

For straightforward cases with undisputed debt, individuals can often respond to the lawsuit themselves and negotiate a settlement or payment plan directly with the creditor. However, legal counsel is advisable for substantial debts, complex legal issues, or if a valid defense exists, such as an expired statute of limitations. The most critical step is to respond to the lawsuit promptly to avoid a default judgment, which can lead to wage garnishment or frozen bank accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

The court determined that under the Montreal Convention governing air travel, liability for a lost pet is subject to the same rules as baggage unless a special declaration of interest is made beforehand.

          <p>As social media platforms evolve from connection tools to entertainment hubs, the nature of online interactions is changing, causing real relationships to feel increasingly one-sided, or 'parasocial.' The passive consumption of friends' life updates, mixed into a feed of advertisements and influencer content, reduces the expectation of reciprocal engagement. This dynamic, where friends become an audience and communication becomes content, mirrors the one-sided connection fans feel with celebrities. Experts suggest this shift may be rewiring how we perceive social connection, potentially leading us to assume more and engage less, even with people we genuinely know and care about.</p>

          <p>The Pennsylvania trial of Luigi Mangione, arrested there in connection with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has been effectively halted. A judge ruled that since Mangione is in federal custody in New York and refuses to appear for hearings remotely, the Pennsylvania case cannot proceed until he can be physically present. Federal authorities have not allowed his transfer, suggesting the state charges—which include forgery and carrying a firearm without a license—will not be addressed until after his federal murder case concludes. This procedural deadlock creates a significant delay in the legal proceedings against him in Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>Colonel Doug Krugman, a combat veteran, has resigned from the U.S. Marine Corps after 24 years of service, citing deep concerns about the country's future under President Trump. In an op-ed, Krugman stated he left due to what he perceives as the president's contempt for the Constitution, pointing to the pardoning of January 6th rioters and the testing of legal limits on executive power. He wrote that he was unwilling to risk his life defending actions he considers immoral and warned of a potential 'collapse' of the U.S. government system if presidential power is not clarified and constrained.</p>

          <p>While high-yield savings accounts remain a valuable tool, savers should avoid several key mistakes to maximize their benefits as interest rates fall. Financial experts advise against using local bank branches, as online banks typically offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs. It is also recommended to diversify savings by placing some funds into a Certificate of Deposit (CD), which can lock in the current high rates before they drop further. Despite recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, these accounts still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings, making them a worthwhile option for accessible cash reserves.

          <p>President Trump is pursuing several large-scale building projects to reshape Washington, D.C., including a new 'Independence Arch' and a $250 million White House ballroom. During a dinner for wealthy donors, Trump displayed models of the arch, informally dubbed the 'Arc de Trump,' which would serve as a gateway to the capital from Virginia. The new ballroom, funded by private donations, will be the largest addition to the White House in over a century. These projects are part of a broader series of renovations Trump has undertaken, reflecting his background as a real estate developer and his desire to leave a physical mark on the presidency.</p>

          <p>Soybeans have become a cornerstone of the modern global food system, yet their primary role is often misunderstood by consumers. The vast majority of soy, about 77 percent, is not used for tofu or soy milk but is cultivated as the main protein source for livestock to support the world's meat-heavy diets. This has concentrated production in the Americas, making the U.S. and Brazil agricultural superpowers and turning the soybean into a key commodity in international trade, particularly with China. The recent U.S.-China trade war has highlighted the geopolitical significance of this humble bean and its central, if inefficient, role in feeding the planet.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its immigration enforcement in Chicago, deploying federalized troops and Border Patrol agents in what the president has framed as a military-style operation. This has led to aggressive tactics, including commando-style raids on apartment buildings and street arrests that have instilled fear in immigrant communities. In response, local officials and activist groups have organized a disciplined resistance, fighting the deployment in court and creating 'Rapid Response' brigades to monitor ICE activity and inform residents. The federal government claims the crackdown is necessary to combat crime, but critics describe it as an unconstitutional assault on the city.</p>

          <p>A new study by the Rand Corporation suggests that Los Angeles County's annual homeless count is significantly underestimating the number of people 'sleeping rough'—without a tent or vehicle—in neighborhoods like Skid Row, Hollywood, and Venice. Researchers found the official 2025 count in these areas fell short by nearly a third, a gap that has widened as city programs reduce visible tent encampments. This discrepancy is critical because it could lead to a misallocation of resources, directing funds away from the most vulnerable individuals. The report recommends using professional field teams to improve the accuracy of the volunteer-led count.</p>
