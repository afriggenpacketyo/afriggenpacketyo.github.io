          <p>Numerous undocumented immigrants were detained at their scheduled ICE check-in appointments at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles this week, leading to their confinement in the building's basement, with some held overnight. Immigration lawyers reported that hundreds of immigrants were affected, with dozens held in rooms designed to accommodate up to 30 people at a time. One attorney detailed a case where a couple and their children, including a U.S. citizen, were detained despite the father having a stay of removal. ICE refuted the claims, asserting its commitment to treating detainees with dignity, while DHS stated those arrested had final removal orders and had not complied. Protests erupted in response to the arrests.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that the federal government has a "very easy case" against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported and subsequently brought back to the U.S. for criminal prosecution. Trump distanced himself from the decision to bring back Abrego Garcia, stating it was the Department of Justice's choice. Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his family, faces charges related to alleged involvement in a human smuggling operation. Despite admitting the deportation was a mistake, the Trump administration has repeatedly characterized Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member, a claim his lawyers and wife deny.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf, who resigned as Reform UK chairman, is returning to the party in a new role leading its "Doge team," modeled after President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf stated that he quit due to exhaustion and overwork. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed delight at Yusuf's return and indicated he would take on a more public-facing role. Yusuf had previously criticized a party member's call for a burka ban, highlighting internal disagreements within the party. The unexpected return suggests the importance of Yusuf's contributions to Reform UK.</p>

Doomscrolling, especially when starting or ending the day, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior.

Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives like exercise and face-to-face interaction.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians have turned to addressing historical injustices through symbolic gestures. Parliament has adopted initiatives to recognize and heal historical injustices, including posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, compensating returnees from Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt." While these measures have been met with mixed interpretations, they highlight a willingness to take historical responsibility. Some experts suggest that symbolic initiatives are easier to pass than structural reforms in a politically paralyzed legislature. The actions signal a continued effort to reconcile with the past and address historical wrongs.</p>
