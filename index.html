          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of Peterbilt and Kenworth, jumped approximately 5% after President Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks, effective October 1. This measure aims to protect domestic manufacturers from foreign competition, particularly those from Mexico, where competitor trucks are $8,000 to $10,000 cheaper. Bank of America analysts believe the tariffs will significantly benefit Paccar by addressing this cost disparity and placing the company in a stronger market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction regarding his 2020 congressional testimony. The indictment follows public pressure from President Trump to prosecute Comey. Comey denies the charges, asserting his innocence and confidence in the federal judicial system, while his attorney vows to vindicate him in court. Critics, however, view the indictment as a dangerous abuse of power and political interference in the justice system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 100% levy on branded drug imports (with exemptions for US factory builders), 25% on heavy-duty trucks, and 50% on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, effective October 1. These measures aim to protect US manufacturers from a "flooding" of foreign products. While some economists note the drug tariff's impact may be limited by exemptions, the announcements raise concerns among international businesses and could lead to higher consumer prices.

          <p>A Texas teen, Benjamin Elliott, is accused of fatally stabbing his twin sister, Meghan, in her sleep, claiming he was sleepwalking at the time. Despite his immediate 911 call and his family's insistence on their loving relationship, prosecutors charged him with intentional murder. The defense presented evidence of Benjamin's and his family's history of sleepwalking, with a sleep disorder expert concluding he acted involuntarily.

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, mortgage rates remain stubbornly high, currently around 6.37%, due to their closer tie to 10-year Treasury bonds rather than the Fed's benchmark rate. The wider-than-normal spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields is attributed to persistent inflation, particularly in services and shelter, and the Fed's reduced buying of mortgage-backed securities. This dynamic has increased longer-term inflation expectations, prompting investors to demand higher yields. (not investment advice)</p>
