          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to appear before Congress, facing questions on a range of issues from the ban on transgender troops to his use of unsecured messaging apps for sensitive military information. The hearings are expected to address the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel and its potential impact on regional stability. Hegseth's policies, including changes to diversity programs and the renaming of a Navy ship, have also drawn criticism. The focus will be on the administration's approach to international security crises and negotiations.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, marking the sharpest drop in eight months, driven by falling shipments to the United States and China. Automobile exports to the U.S. plummeted by 24.7%, contributing to an overall trade deficit of 637.6 billion yen. The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors and potential declines in corporate profits. Tariffs pose a significant threat to Japan's economic outlook, with analysts suggesting that even if trade deals are reached, a full return to pre-Trump trade terms is unlikely (not investment advice).</p>

The author argues that with the US shifting its focus towards China, Europe should strengthen its own defense capabilities within the NATO framework. This involves maximizing the use of NATO's command structure and collective defense planning to ensure European security. The goal is to build a European pillar within NATO, ready to act without the US if necessary. </p>
