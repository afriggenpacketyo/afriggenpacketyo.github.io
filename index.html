          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term, a rare occurrence in recent Australian politics. This decline occurred against a backdrop of mostly closed Asian markets due to holidays and global trade uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell by 0.83%, reversing previous gains, while the Australian dollar saw a slight appreciation against the US dollar. Oil prices also dropped significantly after OPEC+ agreed to increase production, adding to the market's volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is grappling with an increased risk of deflation as it redirects exports, originally destined for the U.S., to its domestic market due to high tariffs. This move, supported by local governments and e-commerce giants like JD.com and Tencent, aims to buffer exporters from external shocks. However, the influx of discounted goods is triggering fierce price wars among Chinese firms, potentially eroding profitability and impacting employment. Consequently, consumer demand remains weak, and both the consumer price index and producer price index have been declining, signaling deeper deflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>Silent book clubs are gaining popularity as a way for people to socialize while enjoying their own choice of reading material in a shared, quiet space. Unlike traditional book clubs, these gatherings allow members to read whatever they like, followed by an optional discussion about their books. The concept originated in San Francisco in 2012 and has since expanded to over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries, providing a relaxed and mindful environment for readers seeking connection without pressure. The rise in silent book clubs reflects a resurgence in people looking for 'third spaces' that aren't focused on drinking or dating.</p>

          <p>Experts are debating how to manage the potential for artificial intelligence to exacerbate inequality in the workplace. Some, like CIMB Group's Pedro Uria-Recio, emphasize the need for companies to equip employees with AI skills and create new jobs to mitigate unemployment risks. Others, such as Prudential Singapore's Tomasz Kurczyk, argue that protecting employment may not be the right approach and that adapting to the changing landscape is crucial. Concerns about AI ethics and the amplification of biases in data are also central to the discussion, with leaders grappling with balancing profits and the ethical implications of AI implementation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, claiming that the American film industry is being harmed by foreign incentives. He argues that this situation constitutes a national security threat due to other nations' concerted efforts to attract American movie makers. If implemented, this would mark the first time Trump has imposed tariffs on services rather than manufactured goods. The move comes after China announced it would reduce the number of US films it imported.</p>

Authorities believe that all of the victims and the suspect knew each other, and are treating the incident as isolated. The conditions of the victims are currently unknown.</p>

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to address the issues in England's social care system for older and disabled adults is an unsustainable choice with financial and human costs. The report highlights that taxpayers are currently paying £32 billion a year for a broken system, which is also heavily reliant on unpaid carers. The committee suggests that investment in social care could drive economic growth, creating jobs and generating returns to the wider economy. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and states it has already begun work on the issue.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption crackdown targeting high-ranking officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. The campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is considered limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters might be a contributing factor. In the past two years, several high-profile military figures have been investigated and removed from their positions, including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC). These actions underscore Xi's focus on maintaining discipline and loyalty within the military.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is uncertain whether everyone in the U.S., including non-citizens, is entitled to due process under the Constitution. He deferred to his attorneys and Attorney General Pam Bondi for interpretation. His comments arose during a discussion of the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Trump claimed the Justice Department views the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return differently and suggested he may be involved with MS-13.</p>

Trump cited the cartels' violence and drug trafficking as reasons for his proposal, stating that the president of Mexico is a lovely woman, but she is so afraid of the cartels that she can’t even think straight.</p>
