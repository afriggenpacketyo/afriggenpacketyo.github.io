          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent student negotiator during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration. The complaint alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress following his three-month detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was targeted for deportation based on a determination that his presence posed a risk to U.S. foreign policy. His legal team argues the arrest was retaliatory for his constitutionally protected speech.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations involving the U.S. and Israel, the conflict in Gaza continues with significant casualties. A recent Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah reportedly killed 15 civilians, including ten children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic run by a U.S. charity. The organization condemned the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" involved in the October 7th attack and is investigating the harm caused to civilians.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man in Texas, who was already on probation for a drug charge, was arrested for pursuing and damaging a vehicle belonging to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The man allegedly chased the agents' vehicle in a dangerous manner, causing damage to a side mirror before being apprehended by local law enforcement. This event takes place amid a reported significant increase in assaults against federal immigration agents nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science made an unexpected and rare paleontological discovery on its own property. A 67.5-million-year-old dinosaur vertebra was found in a narrow core sample drilled over 750 feet deep under the museum's parking lot. The drilling was part of a study to explore geothermal heating potential for the building. Curators described the find as incredibly unlikely, comparing it to a "hole in one from the moon," and believe the fossil belongs to a small, plant-eating dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period.</p>

The Trump administration has tightened these restrictions, which Nvidia has stated effectively cuts off its sales to the significant Chinese market, creating a major challenge for the company's continued growth.

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports is stretching the interpretation of his executive authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The administration is justifying the move partly as retaliation for the prosecution of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a rationale critics argue falls outside the law's scope. This use of IEEPA is already being challenged in federal court regarding other tariffs, and legal experts suggest this new action further undermines the administration's claims of broad, unreviewable power on trade matters.

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing an unusually hot year, with spring being the warmest on record and the nation already facing its third heatwave of the summer. This article analyzes the trend, explaining that human-induced climate change is unequivocally the cause of rising global temperatures. Scientists note that a 1°C global increase can mean heatwaves in the UK are 3-4°C warmer. The piece debunks the idea that this is "just summer," showing how today's frequent and widespread heat events differ from isolated historical heatwaves like the one in 1976.</p>

          <p>A surgeon, Marc Lamah, who was banned from working for the private company Nuffield Health over patient safety concerns, is reportedly still performing operations for an NHS trust in Sussex. Nuffield Health withdrew his practicing privileges after an investigation found his conduct did not meet their standards. However, the NHS trust states its own audit found his outcomes to be within the expected range. The article details the case of one NHS patient who claims she suffered severe, long-term complications from a surgery he performed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a paradoxical trend, South Korea's fertility clinics are thriving even as the country's birth rate remains the lowest in the world. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with experts attributing the boom to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning. Many young South Koreans delay having children due to social and financial pressures, leading them to seek medical assistance like IVF when they are older. This demand offers a small glimmer of hope in the nation's severe demographic crisis.</p>

          <p>Federal agents and protesters clashed during an immigration enforcement raid at a farm in Ventura County, Southern California. During the confrontation, agents were seen pinning at least one person to the ground and deploying irritants. This was one of several large-scale immigration operations in the region, which come as the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to carry out mass deportations. The increased enforcement has heightened tensions, with local leaders recently denouncing a separate, heavily militarized raid in a Los Angeles park as a political act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals an alarming trend: the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the rise in average global temperatures. This means that each small increase in warming will have a disproportionately larger impact on the length and severity of extreme heat events. The study, which analyzed global heat wave data, warns that the longest and rarest heat waves are changing the fastest. This accelerated effect poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, underscoring the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a policy change that will exclude undocumented children from Head Start, the federal preschool program for low-income families. This move reverses decades of policy and is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The Department of Health and Human Services reclassified Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits" to legally bar non-citizens from accessing them. Critics warn this will create fear and confusion among all immigrant families seeking to support their children's development.</p>

The company's strong performance, particularly in its direct-to-consumer channels and women's apparel category, has given it the flexibility to mitigate some of the tariff-related costs without immediately passing them on to shoppers.
