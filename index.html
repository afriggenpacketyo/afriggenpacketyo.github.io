          <p>Beijing has unexpectedly relaxed its housing market regulations, allowing eligible residents to purchase homes in suburban areas outside the city's Fifth Ring Road. This move, which came earlier than anticipated, is seen by analysts as a proactive government effort to bolster market confidence amid deteriorating sales data. The policy shift has led to speculation that other major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen might soon follow suit, implementing their own stimulus measures to support the struggling property sector.

          <p>A 90-day tariff truce between the United States and China is set to expire, with no agreement on an extension yet announced, raising concerns of re-escalating trade tensions. The truce had paused a series of punitive duties, but trade has already been significantly impacted, with Chinese exports to the U.S. declining. Negotiations are complex, touching on issues like Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, semiconductor export controls, China's dominance in rare-earth metals, and its purchasing of Russian oil.

          <p>In an unusual agreement, semiconductor firms Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from artificial intelligence chip sales to China. This deal, reportedly brokered by President Trump, reverses a previous export ban and allows the companies to resume selling specific AI chips, like Nvidia's H20, to the significant Chinese market. The move has drawn criticism from national security experts who worry it could accelerate China's AI capabilities, while the administration argues the approved chips are less advanced.

          <p>The question of how life originated on Earth remains a significant scientific mystery, with water being a key component in leading hypotheses. This article explores two primary theories: one suggesting life began in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and another proposing it started in tide pools. These concepts are also guiding the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists investigate the potential for life to exist in "water worlds" elsewhere in our solar system, such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey's top football clubs, including Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, are engaging in a record-breaking spending spree, attracting major international stars with massive salaries despite the clubs' significant debt and the country's economic struggles. Some analysts suggest the government is tacitly supporting this trend as a "bread and circuses" tactic to distract the public from issues like high inflation. Critics argue this model is unsustainable, as clubs spend in foreign currency while earning in the depreciating Turkish lira, creating a massive financial gap.</p>

Parish confirmed that the club rejected a £65m offer from Newcastle in January but now faces a different situation, with Liverpool reportedly interested in acquiring the defender for a lower fee.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has shrunk to approximately 450,000 personnel, a 20% reduction over the past six years, primarily due to the nation's critically low birth rate of 0.75 babies per woman. This demographic crisis poses a significant national security challenge, as a recent study suggests at least 500,000 soldiers are needed to defend against North Korea's much larger army. The decline has forced the military to reduce its number of divisions and has intensified debates about the unpopular compulsory service for men.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Applies for License to Become an Electricity Supplier in the UK</h2>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households and businesses in Great Britain. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, Tesla could enter the UK energy market as early as next year, competing with established firms. The move leverages Tesla's existing presence in the UK, with a large customer base of electric vehicle owners and home battery storage users, potentially allowing them to feed surplus power back to the grid.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's promise of a crackdown on crime and homelessness in Washington D.C., numerous federal agents from agencies like the FBI and DEA were seen patrolling the city's streets. Trump announced the action on social media, threatening to remove homeless encampments and declaring there would be "no 'Mr. Nice Guy.'" The move has caused concern among homeless residents, while the president's claims about rising crime are contrary to recent Justice Department data showing a 30-year low in violent crime.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its "deport now, appeal later" scheme by adding 15 new countries, including Canada, India, and Australia, bringing the total to 23. This policy allows the government to deport foreign nationals who have committed crimes before their appeal against removal is heard, with hearings conducted via video link from their home country. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion aims to prevent criminals from exploiting the immigration system and to fast-track their removals from the UK.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are silent, this article explains that newly formed ones emit a unique form of "music" as they settle into a stable state. When a black hole is created, the distortion of space-time it embodies vibrates and rings, much like a bell, before stabilizing into a perfect, smooth shape defined only by its mass and angular momentum. These vibrations, known as quasinormal modes, are a prediction of general relativity, and scientists are on the verge of being able to detect these gravitational wave signals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three to address its low birth rate. This article analyzes the potential impact, suggesting the scheme may be more effective in poorer regions where the subsidy represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the handout equates to over 13% of an average resident's income in Gansu province, compared to just 4.1% in affluent Shanghai. (not investment advice)</p>
