          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas Floods Decreases Significantly</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 21:22:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following devastating floods in Texas Hill Country, the number of missing individuals has dropped from over 160 to just three, according to officials. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified the safety of many previously unaccounted-for people. The flash floods resulted in at least 135 fatalities, with recovery efforts ongoing along the Guadalupe River. The tragedy has prompted Texas lawmakers to address improving flood warning systems and emergency communications during an upcoming special legislative session.</p>

          <p>WNBA players, including stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, staged a protest before their All-Star Game to voice frustration over ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations. The players wore T-shirts with the slogan "Pay Us What You Owe Us" during warmups to send a clear message to the league. Several prominent players have publicly criticized the league's latest proposal, calling it disrespectful and a "slap in the face," vowing not to settle for minimal terms. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert described the recent negotiations as "constructive" and remains optimistic about reaching a transformational deal.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match significantly delayed by lightning in Washington D.C.

Despite the disruptions, several players made their debut for the English side, which had made numerous changes from its previous game. The victory showcased the team's depth and resilience under unusual circumstances at Audi Field.</p>

          <p>Over three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, authorities have charged two suspects with his murder. Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, face charges for the November 2021 shooting, which occurred while Moreno was playing video games. Police stated the boy was not the intended target. The breakthrough in the case came after recently enhanced surveillance video and police sketches led to the suspects' identification and arrests, offering a measure of justice for the tragic and random act of violence.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass attacks by individuals who are not driven by a specific ideology. The legislation will empower police to intervene and charge suspects who are found preparing for mass killings, closing a legal gap that currently distinguishes them from terror suspects. This move comes in response to incidents like the Southport attack, where the perpetrator lacked a clear ideological motive, making pre-emptive prosecution difficult under existing terrorism laws. The goal is to treat the planning of such violent acts as seriously as terrorism.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in Westbury, New York, after being pulled into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. According to police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, causing the man to be drawn into the device, which resulted in fatal injuries. The incident is under investigation and serves as a tragic reminder of the critical safety protocols required in an MRI environment due to the strength of its magnets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are seriously evaluating the possibility of signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who played for the Clippers for six seasons and led the "Lob City" era, would add significant experience, playmaking, and depth to the roster. Frank acknowledged that Paul is a "great Clipper" and possesses qualities the team is looking for as it aims to build a championship-contending roster. The potential signing would mark a high-profile return for the 40-year-old guard to one of his former teams.</p>

          <p>After years of growth fueled by the belief that it was the language of the future, interest in learning Mandarin is declining in several Western countries. University enrollments for Chinese language studies in the U.S. and Britain have dropped significantly from their peaks over the last decade. Similarly, New Zealand has seen a fall in the number of secondary school students learning the language. This trend suggests a notable shift in linguistic and cultural priorities in the West, moving away from the once-booming interest in China's official language.</p>

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the measures are a warning against unfair practices. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules, escalating a significant trade conflict.</p>
