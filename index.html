        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK's surging popularity in Scotland, marked by recent poll leads and defections of several Conservative MSPs, presents a substantial threat to the Scottish Conservative Party's political viability. Leader Russell Findlay is navigating immense pressure to shift his party's stance rightward, a move that risks alienating the moderate voter base previously cultivated under Ruth Davidson's leadership. This dynamic echoes historical realignments within Scottish Labour, with Reform poised to leverage widespread public discontent and potentially secure key regional list seats in the upcoming Holyrood election, where proportional representation favors smaller parties. The fragmentation of the political spectrum, now featuring seven parties at Holyrood, guarantees an intense electoral contest and suggests a dramatically reshaped parliament after next May.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 01:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's film "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, immerses viewers in a gritty 1998 New York City, following former baseball player Hank Thompson as he inadvertently stumbles into a violent crime caper. After a series of unfortunate events, including a bizarre cat-sitting assignment, Hank finds himself pursued by various criminal factions, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, alongside a hard-nosed NYPD detective. The movie vividly portrays a sleazy, energetic pre-millennial Manhattan, exploring themes of squandered potential and self-loathing through Hank's often hazy, alcohol-fueled journey. Austin Butler portrays the protagonist, who is forced to confront his past and present failures amidst the escalating chaos, making for an affectionate yet grimy tour of the city.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to attend China's "Victory Day" military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender, alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. This landmark visit signifies a significant diplomatic victory for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who seeks to assert a new world order and will use the event to showcase China's latest weaponry and military force structure. Kim's presence, the first by a North Korean leader at this parade since 1959, offers a rare opportunity for high-level talks and comes amidst US President Trump's ongoing efforts to broker peace in Ukraine and a potential visit to Asia. The event highlights evolving geopolitical alliances, particularly the strengthening ties between China, Russia, and North Korea, and underscores China's growing influence on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing significant returns, with one engineer reporting over 30% gains this year and anticipating another 20% by early next year, driven by government pledges to support the shaky economy through the stock market. This strategy aims to create a "wealth effect" that stimulates consumption, despite underlying economic challenges. Traders are focusing their equity exposure on high-beta stocks within the new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors, expecting these to perform well as the broader market stabilizes or stages a comeback. The prevailing sentiment among these investors is that a rising stock market is essential to bolster the struggling economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, canceled a planned trip to the United States due to unresolved issues concerning the U.S.-Japan trade deal, specifically regarding U.S. tariff measures. Discussions will continue at an administrative level as Japan presses for the U.S. to amend its presidential order on reciprocal tariffs and lower automotive tariffs to 15%. While an agreement was reached in July to reduce tariffs on Japanese exports, sticking points remain over the details of Japan's $550 billion investment package for the U.S., with concerns about the U.S. interpreting it as "our money to invest, as we like." Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa warned of negative impacts on Japanese exports and corporate profits due to these uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

A single jackpot winner would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment or opting for a payout via an annuity that would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million. Powerball tickets are sold in 45 states, and the growing jackpot is attracting more players, which also contributes to good causes in their communities.</p>

          <p>Florida is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as an innovative new strategy to combat invasive Burmese pythons, which are severely decimating native wildlife populations. These sophisticated robots are designed to mimic marsh rabbits, emitting heat, a natural scent, and realistic movements to lure the highly camouflaged snakes out of their hiding spots. Equipped with video cameras, the pens signal when a python is nearby, enabling contractors to quickly locate and remove them. This initiative, costing $4,000 per robot, aims to overcome the primary challenge of python detection and follows previous, more expensive efforts with live rabbits. Officials express optimism about the project's potential to protect the delicate Everglades ecosystem.</p>

Spain and Portugal have been particularly hard hit, with roughly 1% of the entire Iberian Peninsula scorched, a crisis directly linked to climate change. These increasingly frequent and severe fires release record amounts of CO2, reaching 17.68 million tonnes in Spain alone, contributing to a dangerous climate feedback loop. Beyond climate factors, rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land also exacerbate the problem by increasing flammable vegetation. Experts warn that continued fossil fuel burning will lead to more extreme fires, pushing firefighting capabilities to their limits and threatening ecosystem stability.</p>

          <p>A Chinese envoy has warned against sowing "fear and hostility" as the US plans a revamp of its visa policies, which include capping stays for mainland Chinese journalists at 90 days and limiting F and J visas for international students and scholars to four years. The envoy urged encouraging people-to-people exchanges and promoting win-win cooperation, rather than erecting barriers and seeking decoupling. The proposed rule by the US Department of Homeland Security cites challenges in monitoring non-immigrants due to a significant increase in entries on F, J, and I visas. This move comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two nations, impacting various sectors from media to education and potentially hindering cultural and academic exchange.</p>

          <p>The US has told Denmark to "calm down" after its top diplomat in Copenhagen was summoned over allegations of covert American influence operations in Greenland, reportedly aimed at promoting its secession to the US. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called any attempt to interfere in the Kingdom's internal affairs "unacceptable," while Danish intelligence warned of "various kinds of influence campaigns" targeting Greenland. The US State Department would not comment on "the actions of private US citizens" but reaffirmed respect for Greenlanders' right to determine their own future. This diplomatic spat follows President Trump's repeated interest in annexing Greenland and a recent US order halting a Danish-owned wind farm project off Rhode Island, further straining US-Danish relations to an unprecedented level.</p>

          <p>Nevada's state systems were crippled by a "sophisticated ransomware-based cybersecurity attack," revealing the significant vulnerability of smaller government agencies to hackers and potentially compromising personal information. While Governor Joe Lombardo initially stated no data was stolen, the state's chief information officer later confirmed evidence of data exfiltration, though the specific nature remains unknown. The attack severely disrupted essential services statewide, including DMV offices and police dispatch lines, necessitating a meticulous recovery process to ensure full eradication of the threat. Cybersecurity experts highlight a growing trend of ransomware attacks on state and local governments, which have incurred significant financial losses and service disruptions across the U.S. The incident underscores the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity defenses and proactive information sharing among states.</p>

          <p>Jelena Ostapenko and Taylor Townsend engaged in a heated post-match confrontation at the US Open after Townsend's victory. Ostapenko accused Townsend of disrespect for not apologizing after a net ball and for starting her warm-up incorrectly, stating, "If she plays in her homeland it doesn’t mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants." Townsend, in turn, alleged Ostapenko insulted her by saying she had "no class, no education," and made a veiled threat about what would happen "outside the US." Townsend, who is Black, did not confirm racial undertones but noted the stigma around education. Ostapenko later denied any racism, citing messages she received.</p>

          <p>Hollywood producer David Brown has been indicted on 21 counts of wire fraud, transactional money laundering, and aggravated identity theft, accused of bilking film and business partners out of $12 million through a "Ponzi-like scheme." Prosecutors allege Brown diverted funds intended for film projects and other legitimate enterprises to finance an extravagant lifestyle, including luxury cars, mortgage payments on his home, and even $70,000 for surrogacy. Despite his producing credits on films like "The Fallout" and "The Apprentice," Brown allegedly concealed a checkered past of fraud allegations and extensive litigation from potential investors. The indictment details tactics such as using a shell company for unrendered services and misappropriating funds from a house-flipping business, painting a picture of systematic deception.</p>

          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant achievement driven by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and persistent demands from US President Donald Trump for European allies to invest more. However, a new NATO report reveals that only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the recently agreed-upon goal of 3.5% of GDP. While the United States remains the largest contributor in absolute terms, its spending is estimated at 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized the crucial need to convert these funds into genuine military capability for effective deterrence against potential enemies.</p>

This initiative follows high-profile incidents, including an assassination attempt on President Trump and fatal shootings targeting Minnesota state lawmakers. Representatives from both parties, like Hillary Scholten and Tim Burchett, acknowledge feeling unsafe and the critical need for enhanced protection.

According to court documents and video, the medical staffers allegedly wedged themselves between officers and a detainee, grabbing an officer's arm and vest, while demanding agents leave without a warrant. This indictment marks a continuation of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli’s aggressive prosecution approach against individuals arrested during ICE operations and protests, escalating the legal consequences for such interference.</p>

          <p>The pre-owned Tesla Cybertruck market is experiencing an "unprecedented" plummet in value, with the average price falling nearly 30% in the past year to just over $84,000. This trend reflects a broader decline in used Tesla values, which are down 14% year-over-year, signaling a troubling sales trend for the electric vehicle manufacturer. Experts point to CEO Elon Musk and a significant decrease in new car sales throughout 2025 as contributing factors, despite Musk's renewed focus on Tesla. The Cybertruck's initial teased price of under $40,000, contrasted with its much higher release price and dwindling resale value, is leading some to question its long-term viability in the marketplace.

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales growth projected to remain above 50% this quarter, signaling robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. However, the stock slipped in extended trading as its data center revenue fell slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive period, despite overall strong performance. The company's data center business remains central to the global AI buildout, with CFO Colette Kress forecasting $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. Nvidia's growth is primarily driven by its GPU chips, and it anticipates potential H20 chip sales to China, which could add billions in revenue if geopolitical conditions permit, further impacting future revenue.
