          <p>Despite a recent trade truce with the U.S., China continues to restrict exports of seven rare earth metals vital to American defense, energy, and automotive industries. While China temporarily lifted export restrictions on 28 American companies, the rare earth metals controls remain in place, signaling their strategic importance in trade negotiations. This move underscores China's broader efforts to control strategic minerals for national security, as highlighted by the Commerce Ministry's emphasis on clamping down on smuggling. The article notes that the U.S. relies heavily on China for these rare earth elements, making them a key leverage point in trade discussions. The Chinese government is trying to take greater control over rare earth metals.</p>

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey has warned that consumers should expect to see price increases due to tariffs, despite recent agreements to lower duties on Chinese imports. The retail giant is attempting to navigate the situation by absorbing some costs and seeking alternative materials, but expects shoppers to see markups, particularly on items like toys and electronics sourced from China. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs on goods from countries like Costa Rica and Peru are also impacting prices on items such as bananas and coffee. Rainey suggested that Walmart may strategically lower prices in some areas to gain market share during this period of higher prices. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has transitioned into a prominent figure in Washington, assuming roles on corporate boards and advisory committees since his father's election. He and his brother Eric are advisors for Dominari Holdings, which saw its stock price surge after their involvement was announced. Trump Jr. has also co-founded an exclusive private club called "Executive Branch," raising concerns about the mingling of private business interests and government policy. Critics argue that these ventures exemplify a pay-to-play culture, while Trump Jr. defends his activities as those of a private citizen and businessman. His connections within the Trump administration and his growing influence in the MAGA movement position him as a key power broker in Washington.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill is advancing in the House, proposing a series of tax cuts that could significantly affect millions of Americans. The bill aims to make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new reductions, including eliminating taxes on overtime pay and tips, as well as offering a $4,000 deduction for individuals aged 65 and older. While supporters claim the bill would provide an average tax reduction of $1,300 per taxpayer, Democrats have criticized its proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. The legislation is expected to undergo changes as it moves through the legislative process, with potential impacts on various aspects of personal finance. </p>

          <p>A Texas mother, Ashley Pardo, has been arrested for allegedly providing her son with ammunition and tactical gear, knowing he planned a school shooting. The arrest occurred after the boy's grandmother discovered live ammunition and a homemade explosive in his room, leading to the boy's detention for terrorism. Prosecutors claim Pardo was aware of her son's violent intentions and supported his actions, even after school officials found a map he drew of the school labeled "suicide route." This case highlights the increasing trend of holding parents accountable for their children's violent acts, following similar convictions in Michigan. The student was suspended for researching previous mass shooting attacks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship, focusing primarily on the legality of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that such injunctions create an unfair legal playing field for the government, while justices questioned the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in place for extended periods. The court also explored the impact of abolishing nationwide injunctions on the judicial system and individual rights. This case could significantly alter the scope of judicial power in blocking presidential policies, particularly those related to immigration. The 14th amendment is at the center of the debate.</p>

          <p>A 9½-month-old baby with a rare genetic condition has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment, offering hope for individuals with thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia created a personalized infusion designed to correct the baby's specific mutation, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency. The treatment, which uses base editing, has shown promising results, allowing the baby to eat more protein and reducing his need for medication. This breakthrough could pave the way for cheaper and faster development of personalized gene therapies for a wide range of rare genetic disorders. The treatment could eventually be used for more common genetic disorders like sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease and muscular dystrophy.</p>

The strikes come amid threats from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to escalate the military campaign unless Hamas releases the remaining hostages. Despite U.S.-backed efforts for a cease-fire, Hamas has rejected Israel’s conditions, demanding an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal. The Israeli military claims to have hit over 130 targets, including operatives affiliated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The wave of attacks has occurred amid warnings from aid agencies about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with Israel blocking food, medicine, and humanitarian relief. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court questioned the federal government's attorney on the implementation of President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, amid ongoing legal challenges. The justices focused on the administration's request to narrow lower court orders blocking Mr. Trump from ending birthright citizenship. Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought to focus on what he described as a "bipartisan" problem of lower-level judge's issuing nationwide injunctions, leading to "judge shopping," by plaintiffs seeking a quick win. Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioned how a policy denying citizenship at birth could be implemented quickly, while Justice Elena Kagan questioned the administration's win rate on the issue. The court did not examine the legality of the president's birthright citizenship executive order.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. could face an increase in supply shocks, speaking a week after the central bank decided to hold interest rates steady. He noted that the economic environment has changed since 2020, with longer-term interest rates now significantly higher. Powell also warned that higher real rates could lead to greater inflation volatility compared to the 2010s. His comments come as American consumers and businesses continue to grapple with economic uncertainty resulting from the Trump administration's tariff policies.

          <p>Several Republicans have declined to run for key U.S. Senate races in 2026, raising concerns about the party's ability to recruit competitive candidates. High-profile Republicans like Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and former Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire have opted not to run for Senate seats, leading to debate about whether Trump's influence is deterring centrist candidates. Some Republicans believe Trump's demands for absolute loyalty make it difficult for candidates to focus on local issues. Others argue that Kemp's decision was based on personal reasons and that Trump's win in Georgia in 2024 demonstrates continued Republican enthusiasm. The NRSC has indicated it will consider getting involved in Senate primaries on a case-by-case basis. </p>

The article outlines the potential consequences of defaulting on a payday loan, including additional fees, aggressive collection tactics, and potential damage to credit scores.

The bottom line is that borrowers should explore available resources and seek professional help to break free from the payday loan cycle.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging the constitutional provision that guarantees automatic citizenship to all babies born in the United States. However, the arguments focused on whether federal district court judges can rule against the administration on a nationwide basis. The justices appeared divided on the issue, with some skeptical of the Trump administration's argument against nationwide injunctions. President Trump has long maintained that the Constitution does not guarantee birthright citizenship, leading to an executive order barring automatic citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who entered the country illegally. The case is a test of district judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide.</p>
