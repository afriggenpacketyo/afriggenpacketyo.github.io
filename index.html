        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tens of thousands of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's supporters rallied nationwide, including in Sao Paulo, just days before a crucial Supreme Court ruling on his alleged coup attempt. Demonstrators called for amnesty for those involved in the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings in Brasília and voiced strong criticism against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a frequent target of the right wing. Bolsonaro, along with seven co-defendants including former ministers, is accused of plotting to overturn the 2022 election results. A potential conviction could lead to over 40 years in prison, marking a decisive stage in Brazil's political landscape and potentially making him the first former president convicted of such an attempt.</p>

          <p>China has imposed sanctions on conservative Japanese lawmaker Seki Hei, also known as Shi Ping, accusing him of consistently spreading falsehoods on sensitive issues like Taiwan, the Diaoyu Islands (Senkaku in Japan), Xinjiang, and Hong Kong. Beijing asserts that these actions seriously interfere with China's internal affairs and severely undermine its sovereignty and territorial integrity. As a result, Seki Hei's assets within Chinese territory will be frozen, and all Chinese organizations and individuals are prohibited from engaging in transactions or working with him. Furthermore, he and his immediate family members will be denied visas for entry into mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, signaling escalating diplomatic tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's shipments to the U.S. experienced a significant 33% plunge in August, contributing to the slowest overall exports growth in six months, primarily due to President Donald Trump's policy targeting transshipments and a loss of business frontloading momentum. Imports from the U.S. also saw a 16% year-on-year decrease. China's total exports climbed only 4.4% in U.S. dollar terms, falling short of economists' estimates and reflecting a high base from the previous year, alongside domestic challenges such as a persistent real estate slump and rising job insecurity. Despite these pressures, the U.S. remains China's largest single trading partner, even as Beijing diversifies towards markets in Southeast Asia and the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-US study, analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unexpectedly revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core. This core, approximately 600 kilometers in radius, constitutes about 18% of Mars’ radius, a proportion similar to Earth’s inner core. The discovery challenges previous scientific assumptions, as most bodies in the solar system have not cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core, suggesting Mars' internal cooling processes may be more rapid than anticipated. Geologist Ross Mitchell indicates this finding could also revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.</p>

The piece contends that it is misguided to attribute America's internal political choices, such as the re-election of President Trump, to external factors like China.

          <p>The family of Raish Ahmed, who was fatally stabbed by his neighbor Daniel Whybrow in Canning Town, East London, has strongly criticized authorities, alleging a failure to protect him despite months of complaints about Whybrow's aggressive and anti-social behavior. Ahmed, a 50-year-old security guard and Uber driver, was murdered in front of horrified neighbors during a dispute over a communal door. Whybrow was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 24 years for murder and causing grievous bodily harm. The article highlights the family's profound grief and their assertion that police and the council did not adequately address the escalating danger, leading to a tragic and preventable loss of life.</p>

          <p>Chicago churches are actively preparing their communities for expected federal interventions, including intensified immigration enforcement and a potential National Guard deployment, by urging calm resistance and emphasizing civil rights. Reverend Marshall Hatch of New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church advised congregants to carry identification and maintain communication, while rejecting "fascism and authoritarianism." President Trump has repeatedly threatened federal action in Democratic strongholds like Chicago, despite local leaders' objections and FBI data indicating lower crime rates than some red-state cities. The article highlights heightened anxieties in Black and Latino communities, where trust in law enforcement is delicate, and underscores community calls for resources to combat violence instead of military presence.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet in Lowestoft, Suffolk, having been entirely unaware of her pregnancy. Mrs. Robinson reported no symptoms, had been working, and even traveled with her husband, attributing hip pain to a previous birth. Dr. Louise Jenkins, head of midwifery at Anglia Ruskin University, explains that "cryptic pregnancies," where the mother is unaware, affect about one in 2,500 births, highlighting the risks of missed antenatal care. The article details the dramatic and surprising birth, the quick assistance from an off-duty paramedic, and the couple's decision to name their son Henry James in memory of a family friend.</p>

The Rams' defense demonstrated a strong performance, limiting the Texans to only three field goals, while quarterback Matthew Stafford surpassed 60,000 career passing yards.

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from US equities for the first time in a decade, drawn to Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence boom and expectations of looser US monetary policy, according to Bank of America. While US equities attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, inflows have slowed this year, with capital now evenly split between US and international markets. Candace Browning of BofA noted that a weakening US dollar and anticipated Federal Reserve policy easing in 2025-2026 are spurring inflows into Asia equities and debt funds.

This celestial event, which has fascinated humans for millennia, occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing the Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue upon the lunar surface. Astrophysicist Ryan Milligan clarified that the moon appears red because the only sunlight reaching it is reflected and scattered through Earth’s atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily than red ones. The article notes that while Asia, including India and China, had the best view, Europe and Africa experienced a partial eclipse at moonrise.</p>
