          <p>Barry Morphew's lawyer asserts his client's innocence following a grand jury indictment for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in 2020. Morphew was arrested in Arizona and waived his extradition hearing to return to Colorado. Suzanne Morphew's remains were discovered in 2023, with prosecutors noting the bones were "significantly bleached," suggesting the body had been moved. Text messages between the couple indicated marital discord before her disappearance, and Barry Morphew had previously filed a $15 million lawsuit against prosecutors, alleging constitutional rights violations. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man previously deported and then returned to the U.S. for prosecution, remains in jail as lawyers debate his potential deportation. A judge ordered his release, but immigration authorities are likely to detain him for removal proceedings, prompting the Justice Department to appeal. Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and has pleaded not guilty, with his lawyers arguing that deportation would undermine his ability to stand trial. The case gained attention after an "administrative error" led to his initial deportation despite having legal status, highlighting the complexities of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's claim that U.S. strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites has sparked debate and criticism, despite a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis suggesting a less severe impact.

The U.S. strikes targeted three Iranian facilities, but the full scope of the damage remains unclear, with some reports indicating that only above-ground structures were significantly affected.

          <p>Senators on the Appropriations Committee are challenging the Trump administration's plan to cut federal funding for PBS, NPR, and certain foreign aid programs. Republicans and Democrats alike expressed concerns about the proposed rescissions, with some noting the importance of public broadcasting for local programming and emergency communications. The White House argues that the cuts are necessary because the targeted programs are either politically biased or not in line with American interests. The proposed cuts face an uphill battle in Congress, with several senators voicing skepticism.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to formally consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in the U.S. housing finance system, potentially integrating digital assets into traditional lending practices. The directive instructs the housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated that this aligns with President Donald Trump's vision to establish the United States as the crypto capital of the world.</p>

Micron anticipates revenue of approximately $10.7 billion for the current period, marking a substantial 38% increase from the previous year and surpassing the average analyst estimate of $9.9 billion. This growth is largely attributed to the soaring demand in the high bandwidth memory market driven by the artificial intelligence boom, with data center revenue more than doubling in the third quarter.</p>

A study found Google‚Äôs AI Overviews decreased traffic to outside websites by over 34 percent, leading some publishers to prepare for a "Google Zero" scenario. While specialized publishers with dedicated subscribers may be more resilient, no one is entirely safe as AI companies train chatbots on stolen books and scrape news articles.

          <p>President Donald Trump and his administration are disputing an early intelligence report that suggests the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set Tehran's nuclear program back by months. Trump told ABC News he is "not happy" with either Israel or Iran after reported exchanges marred the opening hours of a ceasefire he announced. He claimed Iran and Israel both "violated" the ceasefire, and continued to assert that the strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were highly effective.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s growing influence over federal vaccine policy is raising concerns as an influential panel reviews its guidelines for children. Kennedy, an anti-vaxxer, replaced the advisory panel's members with individuals sharing his views, potentially undermining the scientific consensus on vaccine safety. The medical community is mobilizing to produce alternative vaccine guidance, but the competing guidelines could create confusion. This shift breaks the decades-long apolitical, scientific process for determining vaccine recommendations, raising fears that Kennedy's views may be smuggled into official federal recommendations.</p>
