          <p>The FBI and Utah authorities are seeking public assistance in identifying a person of interest in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. A reward of up to $100,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest. Investigators have recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to be the weapon used in the targeted attack, which occurred from a nearby rooftop. The ongoing manhunt involves analyzing security footage, forensic evidence, and over 200 public tips as officials work to apprehend the suspect.</p>

          <p>Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur was visibly upset with defensive lineman Kingsley Enagbare during the first quarter of their game against the Washington Commanders. The confrontation occurred after a moment of confusion on the field when Enagbare mistakenly believed the team was attempting a field goal instead of going for it on fourth down. This miscommunication disrupted the offense's timing, leading to a turnover on downs. Despite the early mistake, the Packers went into halftime with a 14-3 lead over the Commanders.</p>

          <p>The Philippines has raised alarms over China's new environmental protection plan for the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano described the plan as a "clear pretext towards eventual occupation," prompting the foreign ministry to prepare a formal diplomatic protest against what it calls an illegitimate action. China's foreign ministry defended the move as a sovereign right to protect the area's ecological system. The statement urged the Philippines to cease what it termed provocative actions and sensationalism.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to "think twice" before proceeding with a plan to raise tariffs on vehicles from Asia to 50%. Beijing has threatened to take necessary countermeasures to protect its economic interests if the tariff hike, which requires congressional approval in Mexico, is implemented. The proposed increase from the current 20% tariff comes as Chinese automakers have significantly expanded their investments and exports to Mexico. The situation highlights the growing trade tensions and complex economic relationships between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has intensified concerns regarding the balance between security and free expression on college campuses. Security experts and university officials are re-evaluating protocols for large outdoor events, especially those featuring controversial speakers. Groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) worry about a potential "assassin's veto," where violence silences debate. The incident forces a difficult conversation about how to protect speakers without infringing on the open environment essential to academic institutions.</p>

          <p>A panel of Brazil's Supreme Court justices has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The plot was aimed at keeping him in power after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The court, which also barred him from public office until 2033, convicted seven co-conspirators, including senior military officers. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, has denied the charges, with his lawyers calling the sentence excessive and planning to appeal.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in the United Kingdom have raised concerns that an increasing number of children are starting reception class without fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers found that 92% have seen a decline in speech and language abilities among new students in the last two years. Experts suggest social isolation and increased screen time may be contributing factors. This developmental lag places additional burdens on schools, which are described as "picking up the pieces" for eroded local support services.</p>

Parents are also advised to be mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite and to involve them in food preparation.

The review praises some adventurous moments, such as the trance-influenced "Don't Look Down," but finds that many songs revert to safer, familiar themes of devotion.

This has led to a dramatic increase in cancer survival rates, surpassing the UK's.

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that it was discriminatory and unconstitutional to prevent husbands from taking their wives' last names. The court found that the existing legislation, which only allowed women to change their names upon marriage, violated the right to equality and was a "colonial import." The case was brought by two couples who had been denied the right to change the husband's name. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the landmark ruling.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators who aim to foster a stable, sustainable bull market rather than a volatile boom-and-bust cycle. Beijing's long-term goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household wealth, which could help shift assets away from the property sector and boost consumer spending. After a recent pullback moderated the market's rapid ascent, regulators may be hoping for a transition to a "slow bull" market. This would reduce the risk of speculative behavior by retail investors and support broader economic goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern Water has prohibited tanker companies from using its standpipes to supply water to the 2,500-acre English estate of American billionaire Stephen Schwarzman. The action came after local residents filmed numerous tankers transporting water to help fill a new lake on the property, despite a local hosepipe ban for domestic users. While the extraction was technically legal as it was for construction, the water utility's managing director called the usage "appalling" and immediately banned it. A spokesperson for Schwarzman stated the water was sourced legally and that an advanced irrigation system would be the lake's primary water source.</p>

Struthers had been the administrative director for the center's jazz programming, whose artistic director, Jason Moran, also departed in July.
