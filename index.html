          <p>Following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared several key takeaways in an exclusive interview. He stated that while significant progress was made, "there’s no deal until there’s a deal," declining to specify the main sticking points. Trump suggested that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European nations, and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal." He also rated the meeting a "10" for rapport and reiterated his belief that the war would not have occurred under his presidency.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, marking the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. While not currently projected to impact the United States, the National Hurricane Center is urging Caribbean islands to monitor the storm's progress due to risks of heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions. The storm's path is expected to curve northward, passing just north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This development aligns with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>The personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans resettled in the UK has been potentially compromised following a cybersecurity incident at a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor. The breach exposed names, passport information, and details related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) for individuals who traveled to the UK between January and March 2024. This incident follows a separate major data leak from 2022, raising serious concerns about the safety of Afghans who worked with British forces.

          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump stated he does not currently need to consider retaliatory tariffs against China for purchasing Russian oil. While he has previously threatened sanctions to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine, Trump told Fox News that the progress made during the summit deferred the need for such action for now. However, he noted that he might have to reconsider imposing tariffs in "two or three weeks." This contrasts with a 25% tariff recently imposed on Indian goods for similar reasons.

          <p>A critical analysis of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin concludes that the meeting ended without any tangible deliverables, particularly regarding a ceasefire or peace deal for Ukraine. Despite the high-profile nature of the event, both leaders offered vague statements about progress while providing no specific details, leaving allies and observers uncertain. The article suggests that the summit was a strategic victory for Putin, who gained international legitimacy from the meeting on US soil without making any apparent concessions. Ultimately, Trump's promise to quickly end the war remains unfulfilled, with the next steps in the conflict still unclear.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that convicted murderer Grant Hardin spent six months planning his prison escape, exploiting lax security in the facility's kitchen. Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," created a fake law enforcement uniform using markers and laundry, fashioned a badge from a can lid, and smuggled out food to survive. He told investigators that he simply walked up to a gate and directed the tower guard to open it, which they did without confirming his identity. The report led to the firing of two employees and highlighted significant security failures at the Calico Rock prison.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court hearing, the Justice Department has agreed to scale back the Trump administration's takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, and a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi that named a DEA administrator as emergency police chief will be rewritten. The resolution came after D.C. filed a lawsuit arguing the move was an illegal overreach of federal power under the Home Rule Act. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes expressed skepticism about the administration's legal authority to assume full operational control of the local police department.</p>

Officials hope this model of for-sale ADUs could serve as a new generation of starter homes, helping to address the state's severe housing crisis.

This practice, the lawsuit claims, violates federal and state privacy and wiretap laws.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have focused on the lakebed to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. Researchers now suggest that since pollution sources are so diverse—including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads—efforts should pivot towards protecting people indoors. This could involve distributing air filters and weatherizing homes, a shift from source control to exposure control to more effectively improve public health.</p>

          <h2>California Democrats Propose New Congressional Maps to Counter Republican Gerrymandering Efforts</h2>

          <p>In a strategic political move, California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps. The plan, which would require voter approval in a November special election, aims to create five new Democratic-leaning districts, potentially flipping seats currently held by Republicans. This effort is a direct response to similar redistricting pushes in Republican-led states like Texas, initiated at the urging of former President Donald Trump. The outcome could significantly impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections and positions California as a leader in the Democratic resistance.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily stopped after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator at Anfield. The referee, Anthony Taylor, paused the game for four minutes in the first half to address the situation with both managers and team captains, in line with the league's anti-discrimination protocol. Semenyo went on to score two goals in the match. The incident was widely condemned, with the Football Association and Liverpool FC issuing statements and a police investigation now underway to identify the individual responsible.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant resurgence, with recent successful debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle signaling renewed investor confidence. After a prolonged downturn caused by inflation and rising interest rates, Wall Street is seeing a "very healthy list" of companies preparing to go public in the latter half of the year. This revival is supported by a strong performance in the Nasdaq and a more favorable regulatory outlook. However, some analysts caution that the exuberant first-day pops could be a sign of an overheating market reminiscent of the dot-com era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's opening Premier League match was marked by emotional tributes to forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car crash in July at the age of 28. Before the game against Bournemouth, fans in the Kop held up a mosaic reading "DJ20," and a period of silence was observed with Jota's family in attendance. Throughout the match, fans sang chants in his honor, and players paid tribute after scoring in the 4-2 victory. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt for the season, and players will wear a "Forever 20" emblem on their kits as a season-long memorial.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored, and its Burmese curator forced to flee, following complaints from the Chinese government. The show, "Constellation of Complicity," featured works by exiled artists, including those from Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, which angered Chinese embassy officials. After officials visited the gallery, artworks were removed and descriptions were painted over to conceal references to sensitive regions. The curator, who has since fled to the UK to seek asylum, alleges this is an act of transnational repression, while China's embassy accused the show of promoting separatism.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a minimalist, customizable pickup truck with a target price well below the U.S. average. The company's strategy is to produce a simple, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. The company's main selling point is its low price, which it claims will remain compelling even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, analysts question whether the barebones truck can compete with other vehicles in the sub-$30,000 price range, such as the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>
