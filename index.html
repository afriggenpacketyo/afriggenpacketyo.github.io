          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, indicating a desire for amendments to achieve a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. A senior Hamas official noted some concerns about U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli force withdrawal. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas' response "totally unacceptable." A draft deal suggests Israel would release prisoners and deceased Palestinians, and humanitarian aid would be sent to Gaza upon Hamas' agreement. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program reported that aid trucks were stopped and offloaded by hungry Palestinians due to severe shortages.</p>

          <p>Scientists have created an electronic tattoo, or "e-tattoo," designed to track brainwaves and eye movements to measure mental workload in high-stress professions. The e-tattoo, temporarily attached to the forehead, uses electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) technology. This device offers a more cost-effective and compact alternative to bulky EEG and EOG machines. The study involved participants performing tasks of varying difficulty while brainwave activity was monitored, revealing shifts corresponding to mental workload. The device is currently a lab prototype and requires further development before commercialization.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman to be the next NASA administrator, just days before his scheduled Senate confirmation vote. White House spokesperson Liz Huston stated that the next leader of NASA must be in complete alignment with President Trump's America First agenda. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4, has a long history with Elon Musk and SpaceX. During his confirmation hearing, he stated his priority would be sending American astronauts to Mars, but he attempted to distance himself from Musk during questioning.</p>

          <p>Shakira abruptly canceled her headlining performance at the opening concert of World Pride 2025 in Washington, D.C., due to equipment issues. The cancellation, announced a day before the event, was attributed to technical problems stemming from her previous concert in Boston, which was also canceled. Organizers expressed disappointment but affirmed that the rest of the city-wide events would proceed as planned. The cancellation poses challenges for Capital Pride Alliance, which had already anticipated lower international attendance due to concerns about President Trump's policies affecting the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, faces questions about its effectiveness, with satellite data and field reports suggesting it may not be restoring forests as intended. An analysis of satellite images indicates that some NGP land has experienced deforestation events, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops. The process for communities to secure long-term land tenure is complicated, often leading to short-term access and unsustainable practices. Critics argue that the program has been used for greenwashing and that deeper issues, including poor site selection and limited community support, remain unaddressed.</p>
