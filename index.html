        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in south Belfast will not help contractors dismantle a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The decision came after a multi-agency meeting concluded that intervening posed a greater risk than allowing the event to proceed. Concerns were raised because the bonfire is located near a major electricity substation, potentially endangering the power supply to two major hospitals. Despite bonfire builders voluntarily reducing its size as a gesture of goodwill, the situation remains tense due to cultural significance and safety risks.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary intelligence committee has issued a stark warning that the nation faces a rising and unpredictable threat from Iran. The report details numerous state-sponsored activities, including at least 15 attempted kidnappings or assassinations on UK soil since early 2022, targeting dissidents and media organizations. The committee criticized the government for focusing primarily on Iran's nuclear program at the expense of countering these direct physical threats. It urges a better-resourced, long-term strategy to address what it calls a persistent and wide-ranging danger to national security.</p>

          <p>The father of James "Jimmy" McGrath, a 17-year-old prep school lacrosse player fatally stabbed in 2022, expressed astonishment after the suspect, Raul Valle, was acquitted of murder. A jury found Valle not guilty of murder and first-degree assault charges stemming from a brawl at a high school party, though they were deadlocked on lesser manslaughter charges, resulting in a mistrial on those counts. Kevin McGrath, the victim's father, stated he was shocked by the verdict but acknowledged that Valle received a fair trial, leaving the family to grapple with the unexpected outcome.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order targeting birthright citizenship. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their children. U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante stated that the challengers were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was not blocked and that the injunction is in the public interest. The decision represents a significant legal victory for opponents of the policy, though it includes a seven-day stay for a potential appeal.</p>

          <p>Despite diplomatic efforts, including meetings between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, no ceasefire agreement for Gaza was reached this week. Meanwhile, the conflict rages on, with a recent Israeli strike in central Gaza reportedly killing 15 civilians, including 10 children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a U.S.-run health clinic. The charity Project HOPE condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international law. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a terrorist and that it is investigating the incident while regretting any harm to uninvolved individuals.</p>

According to the UN, June saw the highest monthly civilian casualties in three years.
