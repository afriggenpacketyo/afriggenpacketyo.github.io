        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit but revised its full-year sales growth expectations downward due to the impact of copycat drug compounders affecting Wegovy sales. Despite an 83% increase in Wegovy sales, the figure fell slightly short of analyst projections. The company now anticipates sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the initial forecast of 16% to 24%. The article highlights the competitive pressures and market dynamics influencing the pharmaceutical giant's performance.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement designed to reduce the cost of goods and services exchanged between the two nations, potentially leading to lower prices and increased choice for consumers. The UK has reduced taxes on imports from India, such as clothing, food products, and jewelry, while India has lowered taxes on UK exports like cosmetics, whisky, and medical devices. The article explains that the deal, which is expected to boost trade between the UK and India by £25.5bn a year by 2040, is the UK's third largest after agreements with Australia and Japan.</p>

          <p>AMD has cautioned that U.S. restrictions on sales to China could result in a $1.5 billion revenue hit this year, overshadowing an otherwise positive outlook for 2025. The guidance is based on export restrictions imposed in April targeting AMD's MI308 chips. While CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic about overall AI infrastructure demand and expects new chips to boost sales in the second half of the year, investor concerns linger regarding trade restrictions and competition with Nvidia. The company had previously anticipated an $800 million expense due to these export rules.</p>
