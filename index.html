          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly increased on Monday following the announcement of Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, which came after mounting pressure over his national election defeat last year. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5%, while the Topix climbed 1% to a record high, with Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae emerging as likely contenders to take the helm. The market responded positively, particularly to Takaichi, who favors deregulation and opposes interest rate hikes, with the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar as bond yields rose due to persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of uncertainty in Japan as the country heads into the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the recent immigration enforcement operation at a Hyundai Motor manufacturing facility in Georgia, where nearly 500 workers were detained. He stated that foreign companies investing in the United States must hire and train American workers and respect the nation's immigration laws. Trump emphasized that while foreign investments are welcome, companies must legally bring in skilled workers and, in return, prioritize hiring and training American workers. His remarks followed criticism and concern over the raid's impact on the relationship between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Backup tight end Jake Tonges made a miraculous catch in the fourth quarter to secure a 17-13 victory for the San Francisco 49ers over the Seattle Seahawks in their season opener. With George Kittle sidelined due to a hamstring injury, Tonges stepped up to make a crucial touchdown grab, reeling in a deflected pass from Brock Purdy with a defender draped on him. Nick Bosa sealed the win with a strip-sack on Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold in the final minute. Purdy passed for 277 yards and two touchdowns, while Christian McCaffrey contributed 69 rushing yards and 73 receiving yards.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in *The Wall Street Journal* suggests that China could serve as an external threat to restore internal cohesion in American politics. The author argues that China's threat is real and potent, questioning whether Americans can overcome their divisions to address it. However, the article posits that it is not China's fault that American voters chose Trump a second time. The author disagrees with the premise that China has ever been the enemy and challenges the notion that the U.S. needs an enemy to maintain internal unity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the Hyundai plant raid, proposing foreign workers train Americans in complex skills while urging foreign companies to respect U.S. immigration laws. Trump emphasized the need to legally bring in skilled workers and train American employees, adding that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was right to detain workers who were in the country illegally. He also denied plans for a "war" with Chicago, despite previous posts, stating the goal is to clean up the cities and reduce violence. Data from the FBI suggests that Chicago and Boston have lower crime rates than cities in red states.</p>

Bayrou initiated the confidence vote to push politicians to address the looming debt crisis, warning of potential chaos if parliament fails to back his austerity budget. However, his efforts appear doomed, reflecting President Macron's weakened minority government and a deeply divided parliament. With the political mood drifting towards the right, Marine Le Pen's National Rally party is gaining traction, while Macron faces growing pressure to address domestic issues amid rising anger and frustration.</p>

          <p>Families of three girls killed in a Southport knife attack hope a public inquiry will leave "no stone unturned" in establishing the facts. The girls, Alice Aguiar, Bebe King, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, were killed at a dance class in July last year. The inquiry will examine the perpetrator's history, his dealings with relevant agencies, and any missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy. The families hope the inquiry will lead to change and ensure that no other families have to endure similar suffering.</p>

The administration is also working on backup plans in case the tariffs are blocked, including implementing tariffs through Section 232.</p>
