          <p>Chevron is set to complete its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation following a favorable ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce. The decision resolves a major dispute with Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's valuable oil assets in the Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana. While Exxon expressed disagreement with the interpretation, it stated it would respect the ruling, clearing the final obstacle for the merger and causing Chevron's shares to rise.</p>

          <p>A new law extending and expanding on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could result in an average tax savings of around $2,900 for U.S. households in 2026. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the benefits are skewed towards higher-income individuals, with about 60% of the tax breaks going to the top 20% of earners. While all income groups are expected to see some savings, the wealthiest households will experience a proportionally larger reduction in their tax burden compared to lower-income families.

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna aircraft and flying it to Vancouver International Airport.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, permitting the Trump administration to proceed with laying off approximately 1,400 employees at the Department of Education. The move is part of a broader effort to reduce the agency's size, but it has sparked significant concern among student advocates. Critics worry the staff reduction will impede the department's ability to manage federal financial aid, support borrowers, and process a large backlog of applications for income-driven repayment plans.</p>

          <p>This article examines the corrosive impact of the 1978 white supremacist novel "The Turner Diaries," labeled the "bible of the racist right." It details how the book's racist, genocidal fantasy has served as a direct inspiration for domestic terrorists like Timothy McVeigh and has helped popularize hateful ideas that now influence mainstream political discourse. The piece also raises concerns about the novel's continued availability on major retail platforms like Amazon, which profits from its sale via a neo-Nazi publisher.</p>

          <h2>Polls Suggest American Public Opinion is Becoming More Favorable Toward Immigration</h2>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a significant shift in American attitudes toward immigration, with public opinion becoming more positive after a long period of growing restrictionism. An analysis by Vox suggests this reversal is a "thermostatic" reaction to the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies being put into practice. Support for pro-immigrant policies like legalization for DREAMers has risen, while backing for more aggressive enforcement measures has declined across partisan lines.</p>

          <p>The author of the bestselling memoir "The Salt Path," Raynor Winn, is facing allegations of theft from a family she previously worked for in the early 2000s. The family claims Winn stole approximately £64,000 from their property business, a situation they allege led to the financial troubles that form the basis of her book. Winn has acknowledged past "mistakes" but maintains the dispute did not cause her to lose her home, while the family accuses her of glossing over the truth.</p>

          <p>A provision in the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will require visitors to the United States needing a non-immigrant visa to pay a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250.
