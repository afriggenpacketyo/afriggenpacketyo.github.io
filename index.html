The victims were identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, a couple about to be engaged, prompting strong condemnation from Israeli officials and President Trump, who decried the killings as antisemitic.</p>

          <p>The House voted to begin debating a sweeping domestic policy bill, championed by President Trump, after Speaker Mike Johnson secured concessions to appease various Republican factions. The bill includes changes to Medicaid, energy tax credits, and state and local tax deductions, but faces opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans, threatening its passage. Democrats criticize the bill for favoring the wealthy at the expense of social programs, while some Republicans are concerned about the bill's impact on the national debt and specific provisions like the SALT deduction, illustrating the challenges of unifying the party around a comprehensive legislative package.</p>

          <p>Government borrowing in the UK was higher than expected in April, reaching Â£20.2 billion, which is Â£1 billion more than April of the previous year. This has led experts to predict that taxes will likely need to rise in the autumn to meet the government's economic rules. Tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, but government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs.</p>

While there was a brief period where winners drank cold water, milk returned as an accessory prize and has been enjoyed by 69 consecutive winners, solidifying its place in the race's history.</p>

          <p>China has urged the European Union to ensure a fair trade environment after Brussels proposed a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which come from Chinese e-commerce firms. The European Commission's proposal includes a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment for all parties involved.</p>

The author criticizes the exploitation of these narratives by Afrikaner lobbyists, who have successfully amplified their cause by aligning with MAGA culture and exploiting racial tensions.</p>
