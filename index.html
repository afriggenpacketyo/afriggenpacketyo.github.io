          <p>Executives from Amazon and Nvidia have stated that the demand for AI data centers remains robust, countering concerns about a potential slowdown due to recession fears. Amazon's VP of global data centers, Kevin Miller, dismissed worries about paused data center leases, while Nvidia's senior director of corporate sustainability, Josh Parker, highlighted the increasing compute and energy demands driven by AI. This assertion comes amid discussions at the Hamm Institute for American Energy conference about meeting the growing energy needs of AI, with a consensus forming around the necessity of natural gas to support the expanding infrastructure.</p>

          <p>With increasing stress factors like environmental disasters and academic pressures, mental health days are gaining traction among young people, with several states passing laws to allow excused absences for mental health reasons. Experts suggest that these days can serve as preventative tools, offering students a chance to reset and recover, while also destigmatizing mental illness. However, concerns arise from school officials about chronic absenteeism and the potential for school avoidance, emphasizing the importance of using mental health days appropriately and addressing underlying issues contributing to student stress.</p>

Simultaneously, the administration is reportedly considering potential exemptions for certain Chinese auto parts, signaling a possible softening of the stance on tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating direct investments in companies involved in the mining and processing of critical minerals to reduce U.S. dependence on imports from countries like China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. This strategy aims to combat China's practice of dumping minerals on international markets, which undermines the competitiveness of U.S. firms. The administration is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies investing in approved projects from political changes, along with stockpiling key minerals to buffer against market manipulation.</p>
