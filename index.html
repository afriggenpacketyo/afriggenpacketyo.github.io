          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham addressed concerns about potential Republican Medicaid cuts, emphasizing the devastating impact on healthcare access and the economy, drawing from her state's experience with past behavioral health cuts, explaining the cuts would hurt the economy and lead to more deaths. She also criticized the Trump administration's national defense area along the Mexico border, citing due process violations and advocating for comprehensive border policy reform, such as hiring more Border Patrol agents. The governor urged Congress to pass a bipartisan border bill and focus on addressing cartel activity for public safety rather than indiscriminate ICE raids.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family, intended for use as Air Force One until ownership transfers to the Trump presidential library foundation. This arrangement raises legal questions regarding the acceptance of valuable gifts from foreign powers, particularly concerning bribery laws and the Constitution's emoluments clause. Lawyers are analyzing the legality of the proposed arrangement, focusing on whether the gift is tied to any official act and if it violates prohibitions on foreign gifts. The aircraft would be modified to meet U.S. military specifications before being transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.</p>

Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a ceasefire before negotiations can begin, stating his country was open to talks with Russia, but only after a ceasefire was in place. This proposal comes after European leaders advocated for a 30-day pause in fighting, while Putin has expressed a willingness to discuss a new truce, although he did not address the calls for a ceasefire directly. Zelenskyy hopes Russia will agree to the ceasefire before the talks, as he awaits a full and lasting ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised President Trump huge investments into the US, but falling oil prices present a challenge to these commitments. Lower oil prices impact Middle Eastern nations dependent on oil for their national income, despite diversification efforts. Analysts suggest that Saudi Arabia, needing higher oil prices to balance its budget, may face pressure on spending, while the UAE and Qatar are in a better position. With lower tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Saudi Arabia could become a manufacturing hub, but diversification plans are primarily financed by oil money, which will be reduced.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, there have been numerous attempts to broker a lasting peace in Ukraine, but all have been unsuccessful. Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed a new round of ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul, which European leaders rebuffed without an unconditional ceasefire first being enacted. A history of broken ceasefires and agreements, including the Budapest Memorandum and Minsk agreements, highlights the difficulty in achieving a lasting peace. The conflict has seen several short-term agreements put in place, but both nations have repeatedly accused each other of violating these agreements, and as the aggressor in the conflict, Russia has also breached several pacts designed to secure Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing growing concern about increasing polarization, with the question of how far-right the AfD is threatening to deepen the divide. The German domestic intelligence service classified the AfD as "confirmed right-wing extremist," but the AfD has taken the issue to court, leading to the suspension of the statement. The question of whether to ban the AfD is particularly explosive for the new government, with opponents arguing it would further promote social division. The German Association of Journalists has called on journalists to adapt their reporting and make it clearer that the AfD is not a normal party from the democratic spectrum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza, but top aid groups object to the idea. The proposed solution would only provide food and aid to around 60 percent of Gaza's civilians initially, and the main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal. Humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents. The proposed U.S. aid program for Gaza would be a significant departure from the established U.N.-led system that has long been the cornerstone of humanitarian response in conflict zones.</p>

          <p>India's military strikes into Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan killed more than 100 militants, including their prominent leadership, after India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire was shaken hours later by overnight fighting in disputed Kashmir, with both sides accusing each other of repeatedly violating the deal. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry blamed Indian forces for initially violating the ceasefire, while India accused Pakistan of breaching the agreement. As part of the ceasefire, the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to immediately stop all military action on land, in the air, and at sea.</p>

          <p>A fragile truce between India and Pakistan appeared to be largely holding, as both countries claimed to have come out on top in the four-day conflict. President Trump announced that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of U.S. mediation, but India said it had been negotiated directly between Indian and Pakistani officials. Some supporters of the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi cast the truce as a victory, while in Pakistan, many cast the end of the confrontation as a victory for their country and military. Uncertainty lingered over whether the cease-fire would hold, as there were reports of cross-border shelling soon after it was declared.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly poised to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family that will be converted as the new Air Force One.

However, Trump's legal team has concluded that it would be “legally permissible” for the jet to be donated as long as it is transferred to Trump’s presidential library before his term ends.</p>

The talks were the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January, but Bessent did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated. Trump praised the talks for engendering a "total reset" on the relationship between the two countries. The US has tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, and China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

Mr. Trump questioned whether either side wanted to make a deal and urged both sides to take the meeting.

Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed. The King’s younger brother, Prince Andrew, is still in internal exile, following the scandal over his ties to the disgraced sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
