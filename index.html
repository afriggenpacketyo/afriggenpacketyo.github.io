          <p>Much of the United Kingdom is under yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, the risk remains across all four nations. The alerts follow a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb rainfall, increasing the likelihood of sudden flooding. Authorities are urging the public to remain cautious as unsettled weather is expected to continue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's conflict with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has escalated, with recent suggestions that Powell could be fired over costly renovations at the central bank's headquarters. This follows years of presidential criticism regarding Powell's refusal to lower interest rates to offset the economic impact of tariffs. While a recent Supreme Court decision suggested the Fed has special protections from such a dismissal, the administration is exploring potential workarounds. This unprecedented pressure challenges the historical independence of the Federal Reserve, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposal by New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to create city-owned grocery stores aimed at lowering food prices faces significant political and economic challenges. While the plan aims to reduce costs by using city land and operating on a non-profit basis, it conflicts with other progressive policies he supports, such as a near-doubling of the minimum wage. This article argues that increased labor costs and other progressive procurement standards would likely undermine the goal of affordability. The candidate must clarify whether he would prioritize low prices over other valued social and labor goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has ended its specialized service for LGBTQ+ youth, which allowed callers to press '3' for a specifically trained counselor. The administration cited the exhaustion of congressionally directed funds as the reason for the change, stating that continuing it threatened the entire 988 service. Mental health advocates and some lawmakers have criticized the decision, calling it a cruel move that removes a vital resource for a vulnerable population that experiences higher rates of suicide attempts and mental health crises.</p>

Williamson suffered an ankle injury during the quarter-final victory over Sweden, leaving the pitch in extra time and later being seen on crutches. Teammate Esme Morgan stated that Williamson was in high spirits and that the protective measures were likely precautionary.

          <p>A significant student loan relief measure is set to expire on August 1st, which could lead to substantially higher monthly bills for millions of borrowers. The interest-free payment pause for those enrolled in the now-defunct SAVE plan is ending, meaning interest will begin to accrue again. Borrowers transitioning to other plans, like the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, may see their payments more than double, as IBR calculates payments based on a higher percentage of discretionary income.

          <p>Over 100 days since their implementation, President Trump's tariffs are being evaluated for their economic effects. Analysts acknowledge that the tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, experts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have begun to modestly increase consumer prices, risking inflation. The administration's fluctuating approach and recent threats of new tariffs on key trade partners add a layer of uncertainty to the long-term economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column responds to proposals in Europe and comments from President Trump about eliminating national holidays to boost economic productivity. The author argues that if the U.S. were to consider such a move, it should start with holidays that have racist or colonialist origins, such as Thanksgiving and Columbus Day. The piece defends the significance of Juneteenth, noting that while slavery built early American power, its abolition led to massive economic gains. The article suggests that any discussion about removing holidays should prioritize historical and moral context over purely economic motivations.</p>

          <p>The market for snacks labeled as "high-protein" is booming, but experts advise consumers to be discerning. While protein is an essential nutrient for bodily functions, many products use the claim as a marketing tool while containing high amounts of sugar and processed ingredients. Nutritionists suggest a simple calculation to assess a snack's value: a food high in protein should derive 30% or more of its total calories from protein. They also recommend prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, and cottage cheese to meet protein needs without consuming excessive sugar or additives.</p>
