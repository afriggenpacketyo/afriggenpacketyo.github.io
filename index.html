          <p>An Iranian missile directly hit a major hospital in southern Israel, causing extensive damage and prompting the evacuation of patients, as dozens of ballistic missiles were launched at Israel. Israeli officials condemned the attack as a war crime, emphasizing that the hospital had been partially cleared beforehand, potentially saving lives. This strike occurred amidst ongoing airstrikes by Israel targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites, intensifying the conflict between the two nations. The Israeli military reported targeting Tehran and other areas in Iran, while Iranian state television confirmed an attack on its Arak heavy water reactor, claiming no radiation danger. The situation remains tense, with both sides exchanging attacks and warnings, raising concerns about further escalation and potential U.S. involvement. The optimism score for this article is 10.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over the latter's wide-ranging deals with China, which cover infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington cited a breach of trust and a lack of transparency regarding the agreements, demanding concrete steps to repair the relationship before funding is reinstated. The Cook Islands government has responded, expressing a commitment to addressing New Zealand's concerns and engaging in constructive dialogue.

          <p>An overthrow of the Iranian regime is desired by many due to its repressive nature and destabilizing actions, but history suggests that regime change is a complex and often disastrous undertaking. While the destruction of the current regime might remove an international threat, the aftermath could lead to civic instability and prolonged conflict, as seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. There is no clear successor government, and a defeated Iran, though weakened, would still be a large, proud, and well-armed state with the potential for further turmoil.

          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng urged the U.S. to consider the "whole picture" of trade relations, stating that tariffs on Chinese imports are "still unreasonably high."

He emphasized China's willingness to buy more from America but noted the restrictions on exports of competitive U.S. products.
