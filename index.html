          <p>A tour bus returning from Niagara Falls overturned on Interstate 90 in Upstate New York, resulting in at least four fatalities and dozens of injuries. Police reported that the bus, carrying 52 people, lost control and ended up in a ditch, with multiple passengers ejected or trapped. The victims included at least one child, and most passengers were of Indian, Chinese, or Filipino descent. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has been briefed on the tragic incident, which prompted a large emergency response and significant traffic delays.</p>

          <p>Ether, a leading cryptocurrency, experienced a significant price surge, nearing its record high, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate adjustments in his Jackson Hole speech. Powell's comments on shifting risks possibly warranting a policy stance change led to a "panicked repositioning" among traders, resulting in $120 million in short liquidations for ETH. Companies focused on accumulating ether also saw their shares rebound, indicating renewed market momentum. This surge follows a period of risk-off moves and significant outflows from ether exchange-traded funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to secure comprehensive coverage for the league. NBC is set to acquire Sunday games and Wild Card playoff rights for an estimated $200 million annually, while Netflix will broadcast the Home Run Derby for $50 million a year. ESPN is receiving a new package worth $550 million, including rights to MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategy to diversify partnerships amidst declining traditional TV viewership and growing interest from streaming platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global hunger monitor has officially confirmed famine in parts of the Gaza Strip, leading to widespread international condemnation and a strong denial from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the report an "outright lie." The UN rights chief suggested that starving Gaza could constitute a war crime, while the UK foreign secretary described the situation as a "man-made catastrophe." Amidst these developments, the Dutch foreign minister resigned over a stalemate on Israel sanctions, and antisemitic incidents have sharply risen in Germany. An Israeli manager was also detained in France for denying entry to young Israeli tourists.</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies Flexibility for Expiring Federal EV Tax Credit Until September 30</h2>

          <p>The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, but the IRS has provided a crucial clarification for car buyers. Shoppers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract and make a payment before the deadline, even if vehicle delivery occurs later. This flexibility aims to assist those purchasing vehicles requiring shipment or custom orders, a significant change from previous delivery-date-based eligibility. The expiring credit is part of a broader shift in EV policy, with analysts expecting a short-term sales bump followed by a decline, impacting automakers and environmental goals.</p>

          <p>Gaza City is officially experiencing a man-made famine, affecting over half a million Palestinians, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).

This marks the first famine recorded outside Africa by the IPC, with projections indicating its spread to central and southern areas. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the situation as a "moral outrage" caused by Israel's aid restrictions, a claim Israel vehemently denies.</p>

          <p>The summer of 2025 has been characterized by a lack of a defining cultural theme or "song of the summer," instead marked by pervasive apathy and exhaustion.

Examples include the short-lived "Jet2 Holiday" blooper trend and the politicization of "Brat summer."

          <p>The UK Home Office is attempting to appeal a High Court ruling that blocked housing asylum seekers in the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. This decision follows a temporary injunction granted to the Epping Forest District Council, which cited escalating community tensions after an asylum seeker was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is committed to closing all asylum hotels but seeks a "properly managed way" to avoid further chaos. The appeal highlights a conflict between local concerns, judicial decisions, and the government's broader asylum housing strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his Jackson Hole speech, cautiously indicated that conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, citing shifting risks and "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he noted rising downside dangers and inflation risks from tariffs. Powell emphasized the Fed's commitment to proceeding carefully and maintaining independence from political demands for lower rates. His remarks, though tepid, caused stocks to soar and Treasury yields to fall, as markets interpreted them as a signal for potential easing by the Federal Open Market Committee.

          <p>A new study reveals that air pollution from the oil and gas industry causes over 90,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of illnesses in the U.S. each year, disproportionately affecting communities of color. The research, which analyzed every stage of the supply chain, attributes more than 10,000 annual pre-term births and 216,000 childhood asthma cases to sector emissions. Indigenous, Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations bear the highest burdens, linked to historic discriminatory policies like redlining. The findings, based on 2017 data, are likely conservative given increased production since then, urging a move towards cleaner air.</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquencies climb, many Americans are seeking relief, with credit card forbearance emerging as a temporary option. This article explains that forbearance allows borrowers to pause or reduce payments for a limited period, potentially including fee waivers or interest relief, though interest may still accrue. Qualification typically requires proof of financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, and a history of on-time payments. For those ineligible, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy are available to help regain control of debt.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a redistricting plan, initiating a special election in November to ask voters to change the boundaries of five Republican-held congressional districts. This legislative maneuver is a direct response to Texas's recent GOP-backed redistricting efforts, aiming to create five new Democratic House seats to balance the national political scales. The plan seeks temporary power for state leaders to redraw maps, bypassing the independent commission, with the promise to return authority after the 2030 census. The initiative has garnered support from prominent figures like Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, but will maintain levies on autos, steel, and aluminum. This decision follows a phone call with President Trump and aims to re-establish free trade for most goods covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Carney stated the move, effective September 1, matches U.S. tariff rates on compliant goods, preserving Canada's trade advantage. The White House welcomed the action as "long overdue," as both nations continue negotiations on outstanding trade issues, particularly in vulnerable sectors.</p>

Hammack emphasized the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring inflation back to target, noting that inflation has been above target for four years. She expressed concern that accommodative policies could reignite inflationary pressures, contrasting with the market's expectation of a September rate cut. As a non-voting member this year, her comments highlight an internal divergence of views within the Fed regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>
