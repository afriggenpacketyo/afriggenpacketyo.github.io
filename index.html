          <p>South Korea has reportedly indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and ex-first lady Kim Keon Hee on serious charges, marking a significant development in the nation's political landscape. Han faces allegations of abetting a short-lived martial law declaration by ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, a bid that previously led to Yoon's impeachment and arrest for insurrection. Kim is accused of involvement in a stock manipulation scheme, receiving illicit political polling data, and accepting luxury gifts from a religious movement in exchange for business favors. These high-profile indictments stem from investigations approved by current President Lee Jae Myung, targeting the former administration and underscoring a period of considerable political upheaval and efforts to address alleged corruption.</p>

          <p>The White House has named Jim O'Neill, currently the deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the interim director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This appointment follows the controversial removal of previous director Susan Monarez, who served for just one month, with her lawyers asserting the sacking was illegal and a response to her refusal to endorse "unscientific, reckless directives." The agency is experiencing significant turmoil, marked by deep divisions over vaccine policies, mass layoffs, and a series of resignations from senior leaders expressing concerns about political interference and the spread of misinformation. This shift signals a continued effort by the Trump administration to align the CDC with its health agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first in seven years, signals a potential, albeit cautious, improvement in strained bilateral relations. Despite deep-seated suspicions stemming from past border clashes and China's close ties with Pakistan, both nations face US tariffs and shifting global supply chains, creating economic incentives for cooperation. India aims to curb its widening trade deficit with China and attract manufacturing investment, while China seeks greater access to the Indian market amid its domestic consumption slowdown. Experts suggest that while economic necessity may foster engagement, long-standing geopolitical issues will likely prevent the development of a truly close or lasting friendship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US tariff exemption for global parcel shipments valued under $800, known as the de minimis exemption, has officially ended, significantly impacting businesses and supply chains worldwide. This permanent policy change, championed by the Trump administration, aims to generate up to $10 billion annually in tariff revenues and enhance efforts to restrict the flow of illicit goods, including fentanyl, into the United States. While a six-month transition period allows for flat duty payments, full tariff rates will eventually apply to all packages, leading to concerns from foreign postal services about logistical challenges and potential disruptions. The move broadens earlier restrictions that were initially implemented on shipments originating from China and Hong Kong.</p>

Katrina resulted in nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest storm in US history, with damages estimated at $200 billion in today's currency. The visual retrospective captures not only the immediate destruction but also the enduring determination and resilience of the affected communities in their ongoing journey of recovery and rebuilding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK firms are expressing significant concern and warning of a "chaotic mess" due to new US taxes on low-value parcels, following President Trump's elimination of the "de minimis" exemption. This policy change means parcels valued under $800, previously exempt, are now subject to tariffs, typically 10% for UK goods, along with additional fees from shipping providers for handling duties and taxes. Small businesses, which constitute a substantial portion of UK exports to the US, anticipate increased operational costs, significant pricing uncertainty for customers, and new barriers to international competition. Some companies have already halted US shipments, facing a considerable hit to their sales and questioning the long-term viability of their transatlantic trade operations.</p>

          <p>Tencent Holdings is targeting "aggressive" growth in the international cloud computing market, driven by increasing overseas demand for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Dowson Tong Tao-sang, CEO of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group, stated that overseas cloud operations represent the company's fastest-expanding segment, achieving high double-digit growth in recent years. Tencent perceives significant opportunities in providing Chinese open-source AI models to international clients, particularly those seeking to host large language models within their own regions, leveraging its expertise in AI product implementation. This strategic pivot underscores Tencent's commitment to capitalizing on rapid global AI developments and competing effectively with other major technology firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elderly Chinese survivors, often referred to as "comfort women," are still awaiting judicial progress on landmark lawsuits filed against the Japanese government, highlighting a protracted struggle for justice. Four months after a group of survivors from Shanxi province filed a suit demanding a formal apology and compensation, another eight survivors from Hunan province, now averaging 96 years old, filed a similar case, seeking 2 million yuan for each victim. Despite the profound historical significance and the advanced age of the plaintiffs, provincial high courts in Shanxi and Hunan have not yet responded or provided a timeline for accepting these lawsuits. For these survivors, the ongoing legal battle is critical for achieving both restitution and official recognition of their immense suffering before time runs out.</p>

Despite demonstrating resilience and saving five match points, his relative inexperience at the highest level and ongoing struggles with his serve, including 12 double faults, ultimately contributed to the straight-set loss. Fearnley, who has rapidly risen in the rankings, acknowledged areas for improvement and expressed determination to adapt to such high-pressure environments in his burgeoning professional career.</p>

Windom's family, including his daughter, had actively campaigned against the execution and expressed forgiveness, while relatives of the victims sought closure after 33 years. Despite multiple appeals concerning his legal representation and mental health struggles, Windom's final appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.

This action follows an earlier referral concerning purported false claims on mortgage applications, which previously led the DOJ to open a criminal investigation into Cook.

The attacker, a former student whose mother had worked at the school, used legally purchased firearms and left a note expressing extreme anti-religious and anti-Trump sentiments. This horrific event, described as an act of domestic terrorism, has prompted urgent calls for stricter gun control, with local leaders advocating for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to prevent future tragedies.</p>

The fatal beating of Nichols had previously sparked national outrage and widespread protests over police brutality, and this new trial introduces further complexities to the ongoing legal proceedings for accountability.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged former Department of Justice employee Sean Charles Dunn with misdemeanor assault for allegedly tossing a "Subway" sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer. This lesser charge comes after a grand jury declined to indict him on a felony assault charge, a rare occurrence for DOJ prosecutors, indicating difficulties in proving the more serious offense. Dunn, who reportedly shouted expletives at federal officers deployed to Washington D.C. to combat what President Trump claimed was a rampant crime problem, was promptly fired from the DOJ after his arrest. The case highlights potential challenges prosecutors face in securing indictments for alleged assaults on federal law enforcement, as a similar case also recently saw a grand jury rejection.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues to struggle significantly with its rebuilding efforts, still awaiting $34 million in promised FEMA funding for critical infrastructure upgrades. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich describes a "ridiculous" and protracted battle with FEMA, which has twice denied requests for increased funds to account for rising costs, demanding work begin before full assurance of payment. This ongoing dispute highlights broader systemic issues, as 254 other post-Katrina FEMA relief projects across Louisiana and Mississippi also remain unfinished. Amid the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul FEMA and controversial budget cuts, concerns are mounting that decades of disaster reform could be undone, potentially leaving communities more vulnerable to future natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have initiated the "snapback mechanism" to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, which were originally lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, citing Tehran's clear non-compliance. This significant diplomatic move, outlined in a letter to the UN Security Council, could lead to the reimposition of sanctions within 30 days, as Western powers assert Iran's nuclear program poses a "clear threat" with no civilian justification for its highly enriched uranium stockpile. Iran's foreign minister rejected the E3's legal jurisdiction and expressed readiness for "fair and balanced" negotiations, with support from Russia and China. This escalation follows increased Iranian nuclear activity since the US unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018, intensifying regional tensions.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether Hundred Acre, a prestigious Napa Valley winery, played a role in sparking the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire, which continues to pose a threat to the region. A spokesperson for the Calistoga-based winery confirmed recent discussions with investigators, who are reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard ignited the major blaze. The Pickett fire, which originated at an address identified as part of the Hundred Acre property, continues to smolder, threatening hundreds of buildings and dozens of other wineries. While no structures have been reported destroyed, the ongoing investigation underscores the critical importance of stringent fire safety practices in wine country, particularly during periods of intense heat and elevated fire risk.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is significantly altering its "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers, drawing strong criticism from advocacy groups. Effective January 27, refunds will only be issued if a flight has at least one open seat and both tickets are purchased in the same fare class. This policy shift, part of broader operational updates including the introduction of assigned seating, is viewed by many as a reversal of Southwest's long-standing reputation for inclusivity and an imposition of significant financial and logistical burdens. Advocates argue that the change will increase anxiety and create new accessibility barriers for plus-size individuals, particularly during economic downturns.</p>

          <p>New analysis by BBC Verify reveals that Israel struck Gaza's Nasser Hospital at least four times during a deadly attack, not twice as initially reported, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people, including five journalists. The investigation, based on new video footage, found that two staircases were hit almost simultaneously in the first wave, followed by two separate projectiles hitting the same eastern staircase milliseconds apart. While Israel initially expressed regret for a "tragic mishap" and later claimed Hamas used a camera near the hospital, international legal experts suggest these attacks may constitute violations of international law. This incident significantly adds to the grim toll, making the ongoing conflict the deadliest ever documented for reporters.</p>

Microsoft cited "serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct," emphasizing the creation of "significant safety concerns for our employees."

          <p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killing at least 15 people, including four children aged 2 to 17, and wounding 48 others. This marks the first major combined Russian attack on Kyiv in weeks, with strikes hitting at least 20 locations across seven districts, including a rare strike in the city center and a building housing the European Union Delegation. President Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," calling for a firm global response and new strong sanctions against Russia, asserting that Moscow is not interested in peace. The attack comes as US-led peace efforts struggle to gain traction, with Western leaders accusing Putin of avoiding serious negotiations amidst escalating conflict.</p>
