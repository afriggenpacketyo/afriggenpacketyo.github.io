          <p>China's Institute of Atomic Energy recently announced a successful test of a new passive heat removal system for its next-generation fast nuclear reactors, marking a significant breakthrough. This innovation is crucial for developing meltdown-proof, fourth-generation nuclear power plants designed for a closed-loop fuel cycle, enabling the recycling of radioactive waste. Integral fast reactors, which use liquid metal coolants, are more fuel-efficient than conventional thermal reactors and can even act as breeders. This advancement aims to enhance the safety and sustainability of nuclear energy production, supporting China's long-term energy strategy and contributing to global nuclear safety research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% in July, a notable recovery from steeper drops in prior months, signaling the initial success of Beijing's efforts against damaging price wars. While the mining sector experienced a sharp profit plunge, manufacturing and utilities showed improved profitability. State-backed industrial firms still faced declines, but businesses with foreign investments and private enterprises recorded profit increases. Analysts suggest that the "anti-involution" campaign, aimed at curbing excessive competition, is beginning to yield positive results, though deflationary pressures are anticipated to persist until further industry consolidation occurs.

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley achieved his inaugural US Open main-draw victory, overcoming Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a challenging four-set battle. The 24-year-old grappled with significant nerves, evident in his high number of double faults during tense moments, and was also impacted by a disruptive spectator. This win marks a notable milestone in Fearnley's rapidly ascending career, despite his relative inexperience at the highest echelons of the sport, having only recently cracked the top 50. He now prepares for a challenging second-round match against German third seed Alexander Zverev, who has previously defeated him twice this year.</p>

          <p>New 50% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indian exports are now in effect, significantly threatening India's $434 billion merchandise export engine, particularly its trade with the U.S., its largest export partner. Analysts warn these steep levies could substantially diminish India's appeal as a manufacturing hub and potentially reduce its GDP growth by up to 0.6 percentage points. Key sectors highly exposed to these tariffs include engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewelry, and textiles, which heavily rely on the American market. This move raises concerns about India's export competitiveness compared to regional peers and its ability to diversify trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully completed its tenth test flight, a crucial step toward its goals of lunar and Martian missions. The 123-meter vehicle deployed eight dummy Starlink satellites using a new "Pez"-style dispenser, demonstrating a key capability for future operational flights. Additionally, upgraded heat shield tiles were successfully tested during reentry before the spacecraft splashed down in the Indian Ocean. While significant progress was made, challenges such as developing a fully reusable heat shield and achieving orbital refueling with super-cooled propellant remain critical milestones for Elon Musk's vision of making humanity multiplanetary.</p>

          <h2>NAACP Sues Texas Over New Congressional Map, Citing Racial Discrimination</h2>

          <p>The NAACP has filed a lawsuit against Texas, challenging a recently passed congressional map, alleging it discriminates against voters of color and violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The suit claims the new map, which is expected to favor Republicans by creating five new Republican-leaning districts, was drawn with an impermissible discriminatory purpose to dilute the voting strength of minority communities. The NAACP seeks a court order to prevent the state from implementing these boundaries. This legal action highlights ongoing tensions over redistricting, with the NAACP also urging other Democratic-led states to redraw their maps in response to Texas's move.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance as investors processed China's industrial profit data and the implementation of Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on India. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight increase, driven by Nikon Corporation's surge on acquisition news, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 posted gains, with some economists cautioning against "irrational exuberance" in the latter. Analysts suggest that improving liquidity conditions and a dovish Federal Reserve might limit the depth and duration of any market corrections, despite the geopolitical and economic headwinds.

          <p>The city of Anaheim is undertaking a comprehensive assessment to determine the long-term viability and future of Angel Stadium, affectionately known as "the Big A," which approaches its 60th anniversary next year. This evaluation aims to quantify the substantial investment, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, required to sustain the stadium for decades to come. Currently, there are no active discussions between the city and the Angels baseball team regarding the extension of their lease beyond 2032. A previous deal for the team's owner to purchase the stadium and surrounding land was terminated in 2022 amidst a federal corruption investigation.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Southern California have dismantled a sophisticated retail crime ring, dubbed "Operation Kill Switch," responsible for over 600 thefts totaling an estimated $10 million from Home Depot stores. Nine alleged key players face 48 criminal counts, including conspiracy, organized retail theft, and money laundering. The alleged ringleader, David Ahl, directed "boosters" to steal high-value electrical components, which he then resold through his electronics storefront. The operation led to 14 arrests and the seizure of millions in stolen property and illicit funds, with a new law facilitating the consolidation of multi-county retail crime charges aiding the prosecution.</p>

Concurrently, nationwide protests in Israel called for the government to accept a hostage deal with Hamas, which Prime Minister Netanyahu has dismissed.

The Super Heavy booster also performed as expected, splashing down in the Gulf.
