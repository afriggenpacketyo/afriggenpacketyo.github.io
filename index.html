          <h2>Trump Floats Lowering China Tariffs to 80% Ahead of Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 10:41:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested reducing tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks, a significant cut from the current 145% but still high compared to the 10% in the U.S.-U.K. agreement. The move's intent is unclear, whether it's a negotiation tactic or a long-term plan. China remains a key challenge in Trump's trade agenda, with tensions high despite partial tariff pauses on other major countries. In 2024, the U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China while importing $438.9 billion. Optimism around the future of trade is tepid, but still present.</p>

Merz intends to collaborate closely with France and Poland, addressing criticisms of his predecessor's coalition for its slow positioning on key projects, such as asylum system reform.

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush, passed away at 85, having served nearly 20 years on the high court. Despite his Republican appointment, Souter often sided with the court's liberal wing, frustrating conservatives on issues like affirmative action and abortion rights. He co-authored the 1992 decision reaffirming Roe v. Wade. After retiring in 2009, Souter returned to New Hampshire and continued to hear cases on the 1st Circuit, including upholding Massachusetts' ban on certain semiautomatic assault weapons.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, made by Teal Health, offering an accessible alternative to Pap smears. The test involves a vaginal swab to screen for HPV, which causes almost all cervical cancer cases, allowing women to avoid in-person appointments. Studies show the at-home test is about as accurate as Pap smears. Teal Health plans to launch the test in California next month, working with insurers and donors to make it affordable, with positive results leading to referrals for further in-person examination.</p>

The firings were criticized as politicizing the museum, but the museum's initial statement did not mention the terminations.

          <p>President Trump has expressed support for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while also acknowledging potential political challenges and suggesting Republicans might oppose the idea. This comes after Trump reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson about adding a tax hike on the highest earners to a major tax and spending bill. Trump stated he would "graciously" accept a "TINY" tax increase for the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers. However, he also voiced concerns about potential backlash from Democrats and referenced George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise.</p>

The US Treasury Secretary and Trade Representative are set to meet with China's Vice-Premier in Geneva, but analysts believe the US-UK trade deal will have little bearing on these discussions, primarily because China is a much larger economy than the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge awarded over $680,000 to 17 families who claimed they were sickened by a 2021 jet fuel leak into a Navy drinking water system in Hawaii. These bellwether cases set the stage for another 7,500 lawsuits awaiting resolution. The judge acknowledged the contaminated water could have caused the families' medical problems but found insufficient evidence for a direct link. The leak occurred at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, affecting 90,000 people, and led to complaints of various health issues, prompting the military to drain the tanks and close the facility.</p>

Many companies are importing essential products despite concerns about consumer demand and the economic slowdown. Trump suggested lowering tariffs to 80%, but businesses still consider this extremely high, creating confusion and uncertainty.

          <p>The Trump administration has reached a preliminary trade deal with the United Kingdom, reducing tariffs on British-made cars and eliminating duties on steel and aluminum, while opening the UK market to American farmers. The deal, though touted by Trump as a major trade agreement, is a limited outline needing extensive negotiations and congressional approval. Under the plan, the tariff on British cars will be reduced from 27.5% to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles, and the UK will cut the tariff on US ethanol to zero. Outstanding issues on pharmaceuticals and the UK's digital services tax remain to be resolved.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is facing a potential crisis due to the Trump administration's actions, including threats to cut off grant money indefinitely. Despite legal challenges and widespread support, Harvard leaders believe the school faces significant troubles that may force it to rethink its identity and scale. Outcomes could lead to cuts in research and workforce, potentially transforming Harvard into a smaller, teaching-focused college. Harvard has already imposed a hiring freeze and started layoffs, while the board has decided to continue fighting, but some officials have considered negotiating a settlement.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the half-ton spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, posing a small risk to humans. The spacecraft, originally intended to land on Venus, never left Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. While most of the spacecraft disintegrated, the landing capsule has been circling Earth for decades, gradually losing altitude, and may survive reentry due to its robust design.</p>

          <p>Japan Rugby League One plans to change player registration rules to increase playing time for Japanese players, starting in the 2026-27 season. At least eight of the 15 players per team must meet certain conditions, such as being Japanese-born, and be on the pitch simultaneously during a match. The new system divides Category A players into "A1" and "A2," with A1 players being from Japan. The move aims to promote domestic talent and has the potential to be controversial as teams try to balance the rule with international talent.</p>

          <p>A recent study has found that the severe storms that struck the central Mississippi valley in early April, resulting in deaths and widespread destruction, were made significantly more likely and intense due to the burning of fossil fuels. The rainfall was approximately 9% more intense and 40% more likely because of human-caused climate change. The warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which fed the storm moisture, were also exacerbated by the climate crisis, making such conditions 14 times more likely. The study also noted that cuts to the National Weather Service could endanger lives.</p>
