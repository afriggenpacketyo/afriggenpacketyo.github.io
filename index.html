          <h2>Bitcoin Plunges Amid Global Market Downturn Triggered by Tariff Fears</h2>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $79,000, as it joined a broader cryptocurrency and global market sell-off driven by investor anxieties over President Trump's newly implemented tariffs. The decline in Bitcoin's value triggered substantial long liquidations, where traders betting on price increases were forced to sell to cover losses. Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and Solana, also suffered considerable losses, reflecting the overall market's negative sentiment. This downturn comes amid concerns that the tariffs could lead to increased financial market volatility and a potential economic slowdown.

          <p>A second child in Texas has died from complications related to the ongoing measles outbreak, with health officials emphasizing the critical importance of vaccination. The outbreak, which originated in a religious community with low vaccination rates, has now spread to neighboring states and even Mexico, leading to over 600 cases in the U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., despite his past vaccine skepticism, has visited Texas to support local health officials and distribute vaccines, while Senator Bill Cassidy urges stronger pro-vaccine messaging to prevent further deaths. This incident underscores the dangers of declining vaccination rates and the devastating consequences of measles, a disease declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller publicly reiterated his stance against tariffs exceeding 10%, distancing himself from President Trump's sweeping tariff plan that imposes rates as high as 50%. Druckenmiller views tariffs as a consumption tax, with foreigners paying a portion of it. His statement comes as stock prices have sharply declined following Trump's tariff announcement, causing market losses not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic. Druckenmiller's opposition adds to the growing concerns among investors and economists regarding the potential negative impact of high tariffs on the global economy.

          <p>The United States has cancelled visas for all South Sudanese passport holders due to South Sudan's refusal to accept its citizens being deported from the U.S., according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This action, a cornerstone of President Trump's immigration policy, aims to enforce the return of unlawful migrants. Fears are growing that South Sudan may again descend into civil war, with the US having ordered all its non-emergency staff to leave the country in March. The situation raises concerns for South Sudanese individuals in the U.S., including Duke University basketball player Khaman Maluach, as the university investigates the implications for its students.</p>

          <p>California has a unique opportunity to reallocate state climate funds to support climate-smart agriculture practices on farms and ranches. Investing in these practices, such as planting perennials and using cover crops, can reduce emissions, improve climate resilience, and provide economic benefits to farmers. While agriculture accounts for 8% of California's emissions, it has only received 5% of the state's cap-and-trade funds, highlighting the need for increased and consistent funding. By allocating 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to climate-smart agriculture programs, California can empower farmers to lead in climate action.</p>
