          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to do so. The announcement, planned for the UN General Assembly, is framed as part of a push for an immediate ceasefire, hostage release, and a lasting peace in the Middle East. The decision has been welcomed by Palestinian officials as a commitment to international law but condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated the move "rewards terror." The UK has called for an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.</p>

          <p>Individuals deported from the U.S. are encountering major challenges as they try to build new lives in Mexico, a country many have not lived in for decades. The article profiles several deportees in Tijuana, including one man who lived in the U.S. for 19 years, highlighting their sense of displacement and the difficulties of reintegration. While the Mexican government has set up some processing shelters, resources are limited and not available everywhere. The piece notes that despite aggressive enforcement, deportations under the Trump administration have not yet reached their targeted numbers.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a major suicide prevention charity in the UK and Ireland, plans to close at least half of its more than 200 physical branches over the next decade. The charity's leadership argues the move is necessary to modernize services and reduce costs associated with physical locations, favoring a shift towards larger regional hubs and virtual volunteering. However, many volunteers have expressed grave concerns, fearing the changes will dismantle a 70-year-old support system, lead to an exodus of volunteers, and undermine the quality of care provided to people in distress.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Raiders have unexpectedly released veteran defensive tackle Christian Wilkins, a move that has sparked a significant financial dispute. Wilkins, who signed a large four-year contract last offseason but only played five games due to injury, was still owed approximately $35.2 million in guaranteed money, which the Raiders have reportedly voided. In response, Wilkins has filed a grievance with the NFL Players Association. The team stated the decision was in the organization's best interest due to a lack of a clear plan for Wilkins' return to play.</p>

          <p>Hulk Hogan, the professional wrestler who became a global superstar and propelled the sport into the mainstream, has died at age 71. He was the central figure during wrestling's major popularity booms in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona and again in the late 1990s as a villain leading the New World Order. His career was marked by immense success, including movie roles and television appearances, but was later overshadowed by a steroid scandal and controversy over racist remarks made on a leaked tape. His final years saw a complicated legacy, with his public image never fully recovering.</p>

          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to be unofficially underway as several potential Democratic candidates, including Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom, increase their media appearances on non-traditional platforms. This shift in strategy involves engaging with podcasts and shows popular across the ideological spectrum, a tactic seen as a response to the party's 2024 loss. These appearances are also being interpreted as an attempt to signal a rhetorical move toward the center on sensitive cultural topics. The early maneuvering aims to capture the attention of voters, donors, and party elites in a post-2024 leadership vacuum.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is gripping Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record last set in 1972. The extreme heat, which scientists link to the accelerating pace of climate change in the Arctic, is causing significant problems for the region's famed reindeer, who are fleeing to roads to escape insects. The unusual weather has also surprised tourists who came to the Arctic Circle expecting cool weather. The event underscores scientific warnings that the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal surrounded by political controversy. The approval came after Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16 million and shortly after the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," a frequent Trump critic. The FCC chair, a Trump appointee, noted Skydance's commitments to address conservative grievances and end DEI initiatives at CBS. The lone Democrat on the commission dissented, calling the decision a move that erodes press freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft are currently underspending on artificial intelligence, despite plans for massive capital expenditures. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying increased investment to secure a market-leading position, similar to how Google won the search engine race. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased spending on cloud infrastructure, Cramer dismissed Wall Street fears of a poor return on investment.

The challenge for these firms is to create natural dyes that are as vivid and long-lasting as their synthetic counterparts. Major food giants including Kellogg's, Nestle, and Kraft Heinz have all pledged to reformulate their products to eliminate artificial dyes.</p>

The diplomatic effort aims to revive negotiations that stalled after U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

This action comes as the U.S. faces a worsening homelessness crisis driven by a housing shortage.
