          <p>India claimed a dramatic victory over England by just six runs in the final Test match at The Oval, drawing the series 2-2. England's pursuit of a record 374 runs fell short in a tense final day, despite a courageous effort from an injured Chris Woakes who came out to bat. The match, filled with fluctuating fortunes and high emotion, is being hailed as one of the greatest in Test cricket history. The thrilling conclusion capped off a hard-fought and often fractious series between the two top-ranked teams.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has left Texas in an attempt to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial new congressional map. The proposed redistricting, backed by former President Trump, could create up to five new GOP-leaning seats. In response, top Texas Republicans, including the Attorney General, have called for the absent lawmakers to be arrested and returned to the Capitol. This maneuver escalates a contentious political battle, echoing similar walkouts by Texas Democrats in previous years to block Republican legislation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new legislative effort by Republican senators aims to provide independent contractors and gig workers with access to benefits like health insurance and retirement savings. The proposed bills would protect companies from misclassification lawsuits if they voluntarily offer such perks to their contract workforce. This employer-friendly approach contrasts with Democratic efforts, such as the PRO Act, which seek to reclassify more workers as traditional employees with full labor protections. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle to adapt labor laws to the modern gig economy, with unions opposing the measures as a way to legitimize worker misclassification.</p>

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk approximately 96 million shares of restricted stock, valued at around $29 billion, based on the company's performance. This move comes just six months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, larger 2018 pay package, ruling it was improperly negotiated with a board that was not independent. To receive the shares, Musk must pay the exercise price of $23.34 per share, as stipulated in the original plan. The award reignites the debate over the scale of executive compensation at the electric vehicle company.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 workers at Boeing's defense unit have gone on strike after their union voted to reject the company's latest contract proposal. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers stated that the offer, which included a 20% wage increase and a $5,000 ratification bonus, was insufficient.

          <p>Hundreds of Latino cultural events and festivals across the United States are being canceled or postponed due to widespread fear of increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids under the Trump administration. Organizers cite concerns for the safety of attendees, fearing that large public gatherings could become targets for indiscriminate enforcement actions. The cancellations represent a significant disruption to community life and cultural expression for many, as events that have run for decades are being put on hold. Some organizers, however, are choosing to proceed with enhanced security and legal support as an act of resistance.</p>

          <p>India's information technology sector is experiencing significant job losses, raising questions about the roles of a global economic slowdown and the rise of artificial intelligence.

          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a trade body for the UK car finance industry, has criticized the financial regulator's proposed compensation scheme for mis-selling as "completely impractical." The primary concern is the plan's scope, which could cover loans dating back to 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may lack adequate records. While a Supreme Court ruling narrowed the potential for payouts, it still allows for claims on deals with unfairly large commissions. The Financial Conduct Authority estimates the scheme could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey of American children aged 8 to 12 reveals a strong preference for unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socialization or adult-organized activities. However, the same survey shows that most children are not allowed significant freedom, with many parents fearing for their safety even in their own neighborhoods. The article argues that this lack of real-world independence is a key driver of the "phone-based childhood," as kids turn to screens for the unsupervised social interaction they crave. It suggests that granting children more freedom to play independently is a crucial step in reducing screen time.</p>

Major fashion houses have dropped fur from their collections, and numerous countries, particularly in Europe, have banned fur farming.

          <p>China's central bank is accelerating its strategy to internationalize the yuan, seizing on what it perceives as growing uncertainty surrounding the stability of the U.S. dollar. The People's Bank of China announced plans to expand the yuan's use in global trade and finance, enhance offshore markets, and improve its Cross-border Interbank Payment System. This renewed focus marks the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been featured as a dedicated section in the bank's midyear policy readout. The move signals Beijing's ambition to establish its currency as a more significant player in the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK Home Office minister has stated that migrants arriving on small boats will generally be allowed to keep their mobile phones. This clarification comes after the government introduced a bill aimed at giving authorities more power to seize devices from those suspected of being people-smugglers. The minister, Dame Angela Eagle, explained the goal is to target facilitators of illegal crossings, not to confiscate every phone from every arrival. The policy seeks to reverse a High Court ruling that found a previous blanket seizure policy was unlawful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that the Suisun Marsh, California's largest tidal wetland, has shrunk by approximately 80% since the mid-19th century and is now highly vulnerable to submergence from rising sea levels. The study shows that as global waters rise, the marsh's diked wetlands are losing soil, increasing the risk of being permanently flooded. This poses a significant threat to a vital ecosystem that supplies water to millions and supports diverse wildlife. While some restoration efforts are underway, scientists warn that time is running out to protect the marsh from the accelerating impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Seasonal employees at Yosemite National Park have reported working for weeks without pay this year, as supervisors allegedly used a volunteer program to manage hiring delays caused by federal budget cuts. Some workers stated they felt exploited, having been asked to volunteer for at least 32 hours a week in exchange for free housing while waiting to be officially put on the payroll. The situation arose after firings and rehirings strained the National Park Service's human resources department. This practice raises concerns about compliance with federal labor laws and the treatment of essential park staff.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is actively working to undermine public education in the United States. The author points to the mass firing of Department of Education staff and threats to withhold federal funding from districts with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The piece contends that these actions, combined with a push for a nationwide school voucher program, would dismantle the educational safety net for poor, minority, and special needs students. The author calls on Congress to resist these moves and protect the long-standing bipartisan commitment to public schooling.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced a significant 11.3% drop in visitor numbers in June compared to the previous year, with data suggesting a decline in tourism from both California and international sources. Traffic on the I-15 highway from California was down, and overall air travel into the city also decreased. This "Trump Slump," as some have called it, is attributed in part to the president's tariff policies and rhetoric, which may be deterring international travelers. Despite the drop in visitor volume, Clark County's gambling revenue actually increased, indicating that those who are visiting are spending more. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Environmental advocates are increasing pressure on Los Angeles to reduce its water diversions from the Eastern Sierra to help restore the declining water levels of Mono Lake. Despite a 1994 state mandate to raise the lake by 17 feet, it remains about 9 feet below that target, which advocates say is harming the ecosystem and bird populations. They are calling on state regulators to impose stricter limits on the L.A. Department of Water and Power. City officials have expressed a desire to lessen their reliance on the lake's water but point to drought as a larger factor in the lake's fluctuating levels.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicates a decline in major depression and suicidal thoughts among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12 to 17 fell from nearly 13% to 10%, with suicide attempts also decreasing. Experts find the trend promising, potentially linking it to increased openness among teens about mental health struggles and better access to specialized treatment. However, the report also notes that millions of teens still experience suicidal thoughts, and access to care remains a significant challenge.</p>
