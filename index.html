          <p>Newly unsealed documents in the Eric Adams criminal case suggest that Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, may have known more about the Justice Department's decision to drop charges than he claimed during his Senate confirmation hearing.  A letter from a resigning U.S. Attorney indicates Blanche was "on the same page" regarding the decision.  The mayor's lawyer argues this supports dismissing the case.</p>
