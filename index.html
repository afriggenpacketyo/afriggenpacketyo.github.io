          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her role while the court considers the legal arguments regarding her potential termination. President Donald Trump has sought to remove Cook from the Fed's Board of Governors, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This decision postpones any action until after oral arguments are heard in January, representing a temporary setback for the administration's efforts to dismiss her. The case centers on the president's authority to fire a member of the independent central bank.</p>

          <p>A 20-story residential high-rise in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx experienced a partial collapse on Wednesday morning following a reported gas explosion. Video footage showed a significant portion of the building's corner missing from the roof to the ground, with debris scattered across the street. Emergency services, including the FDNY and NYPD, responded to the scene, evacuating residents from certain apartments as a precaution while search and rescue operations commenced. While no injuries were immediately reported, officials are investigating the structural integrity of the building and the cause of the incident.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, has stated the company's long-term strategy is to predominantly use its own custom-designed chips for its artificial intelligence data centers. This move aims to reduce reliance on external suppliers like Nvidia and AMD, which currently dominate the market for AI-powering semiconductors. By developing its own silicon, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator, Microsoft seeks to optimize the entire data center system, from processing power to cooling, for better price performance and efficiency. This reflects a broader trend among major tech companies to control their hardware supply chains.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent case in Kerala, where a 16-year-old boy was allegedly sexually assaulted by multiple men, has drawn attention to the often-overlooked issue of sexual violence against boys in India. Experts and survivors note that societal taboos and rigid notions of masculinity create a culture of silence, shame, and disbelief that prevents male victims from speaking out. Traditional patriarchal views often fail to recognize men and boys as potential victims of such crimes, leading to their experiences being dismissed or ignored. Advocates are calling for greater awareness and enforcement of gender-neutral laws like the POCSO Act to protect all children.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has ceased operations at its two clinics in Louisiana, located in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, citing compounding political attacks and financial infeasibility. The closures were precipitated by a recent court ruling that allowed a Trump administration policy to take effect, blocking the clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Notably, these clinics had not provided abortion services during their 40-year history, instead offering services like STI testing, cancer screenings, and family planning to thousands of patients annually. Health officials are now working to address the care gap left by the closures.</p>

          <p>A two-day strike by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) at the Dangote refinery has been called off following government-mediated talks. The union had initiated the strike after accusing the company of firing 800 unionized workers and replacing them with foreign labor, a claim Dangote officials denied. According to Nigeria's Labor Ministry, an agreement was reached where the company will reassign the disengaged staff to other roles within the Dangote Group without loss of pay. The resolution averts a prolonged disruption at Africa's largest oil refinery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing plummeted by 21% last week, driving a 12.7% overall decline in mortgage application volume, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This sharp drop is attributed to a recent spike in mortgage rates, which reached a three-week high after hitting a three-year low just two weeks prior. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.46%, discouraging homeowners from refinancing. This volatility suggests that opportunities for refinancing may be brief and limited in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the first day of the government shutdown, the White House Office of Management and Budget announced a freeze on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for major New York infrastructure projects. The affected projects include the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway extension. The administration cited the need to ensure funding does not flow based on "unconstitutional DEI principles" as the reason for the hold.

          <p>The Oktoberfest venue in Munich, Germany, was temporarily closed and evacuated on Wednesday but has since reopened following a security sweep.

Police reported that a 57-year-old man, suspected of starting the fire in a family dispute, had rigged the house with explosives. The suspect was later found deceased at a nearby lake with what appeared to be an explosive device, and a letter he left contained a non-specific threat against the festival.</p>

This event follows similar drone disruptions at airports in other European countries, raising concerns across NATO about Russia's "grey zone" activities.

This article provides a history of the 14 shutdowns that have occurred since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required agencies to cease operations during funding gaps. The overview details the duration and causes of each shutdown, from the brief, one-day events under President Reagan to the 34-day partial shutdown under President Trump in 2018-2019 over border wall funding. The historical context shows how shutdowns have evolved from procedural hiccups into significant political battles with substantial economic consequences.</p>

Another key principle is to live below one's means, even as income grows, to avoid "lifestyle inflation." By saving and investing a significant portion of income, such as 20-50%, individuals can build substantial wealth regardless of their starting salary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its official homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, prompting an ethics complaint. The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, alleging the message is a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity. The group argues that using a government website for such a highly partisan message, which praises the Trump administration while attacking Democrats, is an illegal use of taxpayer resources for political purposes.</p>

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. air travel, a prolonged one could lead to major disruptions. Key personnel at the FAA and TSA, including air traffic controllers and security screeners, are deemed essential and must work without pay. However, past shutdowns have shown that as financial pressure mounts on these unpaid workers, absenteeism increases, leading to longer security lines and potential flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage.</p>

          <p>The government shutdown requires all active-duty U.S. military personnel to continue performing their duties without receiving their pay until a funding agreement is reached. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for federal employees after a shutdown ends, military pay is not guaranteed unless Congress passes separate legislation, which it has not yet done. Essential civilian Defense Department employees will also work without pay, while others will be furloughed. Financial institutions that serve military members, like USAA and Navy Federal Credit Union, are preparing to offer no-interest loans to help service members manage their finances during the pay delay.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly payments on schedule during the government shutdown, as the program is funded through a permanent appropriation. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could lead to disruptions in other services. With nearly 90% of its workforce deemed essential, the agency will continue processing payments, but activities like issuing replacement Medicare cards, benefit verifications, and processing overpayments will be halted. A prolonged shutdown could also potentially delay the release of inflation data needed to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has connected the increase in asylum seekers arriving by small boats across the English Channel to Brexit, specifically blaming the UK's departure from EU agreements. He pointed to the end of the Dublin III regulation, which previously allowed the UK to return some asylum seekers to the first EU country they entered. Before the 2016 referendum, the UK returned more people under this rule than it received. Since leaving the EU, the UK has lacked a comprehensive returns mechanism, which migration experts suggest has made the UK a more attractive destination for some migrants.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, with strong performance in its electric vehicle and large SUV segments. Sales of all-electric models, like the Mustang Mach-E, surged by 30.2% to a new quarterly record, while sales of electrified vehicles including hybrids grew by 20%. The industry-wide increase in EV sales is partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of federal EV incentives at the end of September. The strong quarter for Ford indicates robust consumer demand for larger vehicles and a growing interest in the electric market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For seniors enrolling in Medicare, the six-month Medigap open enrollment period is a critical window that should not be missed, according to healthcare experts. This one-time period begins the month a person turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare Part B, and it guarantees them the right to buy any Medigap supplemental insurance plan sold in their state, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. Missing this window can result in being denied coverage or charged significantly higher premiums later on. Medigap policies are vital for many as they cover out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and coinsurance that Original Medicare does not.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco and will start rookie Dillon Gabriel for their upcoming game against the Minnesota Vikings in London. The decision comes after the team's 1-3 start to the season, during which the offense has struggled significantly, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, has seen limited action so far but performed well in the preseason. The move also brings renewed attention to third-string quarterback Shedeur Sanders, a highly-touted prospect who the team could potentially turn to in the future if the offense continues to falter.</p>

This move aligns with a broader industry trend and increased federal scrutiny on the health effects of artificial food additives.

          <p>Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin are pausing abortion services in response to a new federal law that blocks them from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. The provision, part of a Trump administration spending bill, targets abortion providers and prevents them from participating in the low-income health program for one year. By temporarily stopping abortions, the Wisconsin affiliate appears to be trying to preserve its ability to receive Medicaid funds for other essential healthcare services like cancer screenings and contraception. This development highlights the widespread disruption and financial strain the law is causing for the organization nationwide.</p>
