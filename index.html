          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reportedly detained a group of day laborers outside a Home Depot in Pomona, California, prompting condemnation from immigrant rights groups. L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis stated her office is connecting with the Pomona Day Labor Center to provide support to those impacted. The Pomona Police Department confirmed the immigration action but stated they had no prior knowledge or involvement. The incident is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration under the Trump administration, which has vowed to carry out the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite repeatedly criticizing him. Trump nominated Powell in 2017, and Biden nominated him for a second term at the end of 2021. Trump has been critical of the Fed's decision to not cut interest rates further this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year. Trump also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, indicating a willingness to negotiate, which boosted major stock markets.</p>

          <p>Six major U.S. automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider the proposed 25% tariffs on auto parts.

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's recent comments indicating a softening stance on tariffs against China may give Beijing an upper hand in trade negotiations. Trump stated that tariffs on Chinese goods "will not be as high as 145 per cent" and "won't be zero." Economists believe these comments reveal anxiety from the U.S. side and could allow China to secure a more favorable deal.

As of May 7th, Americans will need a Real ID to pass through airport security or enter federal buildings. A CBS News analysis reveals that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant. Travelers with non-compliant IDs will face additional screening, which can be time-consuming, and if the secondary verification fails, they will be denied entry.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing a challenging year due to the US-China trade war and weaker government support, leading to concerns about price competition. The escalating tariffs are expected to hit exports to the US, potentially causing producers to cut capital expenditure. The sector is also struggling with a price war caused by overproduction, which has led to a decline in export prices. This comes as energy storage becomes crucial for the global transition to clean energy.</p>

The province recorded 1.13 million births in 2024, making it China’s top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year. This trend contrasts with the reluctance of youth across the country to have children, highlighting the influence of cultural factors on demographic trends.</p>
