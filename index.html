          <p>A respected Pennsylvania physician, Justin Rutherford, was discovered to be living a secret criminal life after a hidden camera was found in his family's bathroom. The discovery led to an investigation that revealed he had been sexually abusing his stepson and another minor for years. While awaiting trial, Rutherford attempted to orchestrate his stepson's murder from prison, a plot that was ultimately foiled. He was sentenced to a lengthy prison term for his crimes, leaving his family to grapple with the profound betrayal and share their story as a warning to others.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team maintained their undefeated streak in the World Cup with a decisive 89-run victory against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a magnificent 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings, guiding England to a total of 253-9. In response, Sri Lanka's batting lineup struggled against Sophie Ecclestone, who delivered a remarkable bowling spell of 4-17. The win places England at the top of the tournament table as they continue their campaign for the championship.</p>

The senators criticized the lack of transparency, suggesting something was being hidden, while the Memphis deployment reflects ongoing debates about the use of military personnel for domestic policing.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through London last year, has been officially retired to a sanctuary in the countryside. The 15-year-old horse sustained significant injuries, including a broken bone, after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise. The incident drew widespread attention as the horses galloped for miles through the capital, injuring several soldiers and civilians. After extensive veterinary care, it was determined that Quaker could not return to his ceremonial duties and will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems munitions plant in McEwen, Tennessee, has left no survivors among the workers who were inside, authorities confirmed. The blast, which occurred Friday morning, obliterated the building and scattered debris over a half-mile radius, with the search effort now transitioning to a recovery operation. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis described the scene as one of the most devastating in his career, stating that the 18 people previously reported as unaccounted for are now presumed deceased. The cause of the explosion at the military and aerospace supplier is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has led to the closure of all Smithsonian Institution sites, including its 21 museums and the National Zoo, starting Sunday. The federal trust, which relies on government funding for over 60% of its budget, exhausted its prior-year funds and can no longer remain open. While essential staff will continue to care for the animals at the National Zoo, popular nonessential features like the animal webcams will be turned off. This development marks another significant public impact of the political stalemate over federal funding.</p>

          <p>Private charter airline Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, signaling its intent to liquidate its assets and permanently cease all flights. The Florida-based carrier, which had expanded rapidly since its founding in 2020, accumulated over $38.7 million in liabilities and faced multiple lawsuits from customers and creditors over canceled flights and unpaid debts. The company's situation was complicated by the sudden death of its founder, Richard Kane, in September. This closure adds Verijet to a growing list of smaller airlines that have failed to sustain operations in the competitive 2025 aviation market.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have formally backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan hinges on the SNP winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election, which the party would then present as a clear directive from Scottish voters. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path forward, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. The endorsement overrides an alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto vote on independence itself.</p>

Globally, an estimated 51 million tons of furniture are consumed annually, with over 95% eventually ending up in landfills.

The site manager faces charges of animal abuse and illegal veterinary practice.</p>

          <h2>Cameroon's 92-Year-Old President Seeks Eighth Term Amid Trend of Aging African Leaders</h2>

          <p>Paul Biya, the 92-year-old president of Cameroon and the world's oldest non-royal leader, is seeking an eighth term in office after 43 years in power. His continued rule highlights a broader trend of gerontocracy in Africa, a continent with the world's youngest population. Other long-serving, elderly leaders include Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea and Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, all in their 80s. This dynamic creates a stark contrast with the continent's youthful demographic and growing 'Gen Z' protest movements demanding change and new leadership.</p>

          <p>A drone strike attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed dozens of people, including children, at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, Sudan. The besieged city, the last army stronghold in the Darfur region, is on the verge of collapse after 17 months of being surrounded by the RSF. Local activists described a horrific scene, with many victims burned completely, and overwhelmed hospitals struggling to treat the wounded. The attack intensifies fears of a humanitarian catastrophe, with the UN warning that continued strikes on civilian areas may constitute war crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, potentially ending the war in Gaza, is being hailed as a significant diplomatic achievement brokered with crucial pressure from President Donald Trump. Political analysts suggest that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long built his career on understanding American politics, recognized the shifting landscape of U.S. support for Israel. This reliance on American backing made him susceptible to Trump's influence, which was instrumental in bringing both sides to the table for what could be a historic turning point in the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some areas, Hamas has reportedly recalled approximately 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control and prevent lawlessness in Gaza. The mobilization comes after a violent clash between Hamas forces and the powerful Dughmush clan, which left two Hamas members dead and raised the specter of internal conflict. With large quantities of weapons looted during the war and various factions vying for influence, there is widespread concern among Gazans that the territory could descend into internal bloodshed as uncertainty about its future governance grows.</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to survive in an era dominated by streaming services and high ticket prices by transforming into community hubs. Theaters like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey and Vidiots in Los Angeles operate as non-profits, hosting film festivals, Q&As, and fostering a social atmosphere to attract patrons. Others, like New York's Metrograph, have found for-profit success by offering a premium experience with a bookstore, restaurant, and curated programming. These varied approaches share a common goal: creating a unique, communal experience that emphasizes the magic of moviegoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a televised appearance, former President Donald Trump made a series of mathematically impossible claims regarding future reductions in prescription drug prices. He boasted that prices would soon decrease by amounts such as "100 percent, 400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction cannot exceed 100 percent, as that would imply the cost becomes negative, meaning customers would be paid to take the drugs. This statement was part of a broader discussion where he contrasted these future projections with a modest one-eighth of one percent reduction achieved during his first term.</p>
