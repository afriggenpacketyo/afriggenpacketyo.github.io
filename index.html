          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, suggests that financial sanctions and countermeasures could emerge as a new battleground in the escalating rivalry between China and the United States. While Lian believes the chance of full-scale financial sanctions remains slim, he cautions that Washington might gradually expand its targeting of specific Chinese entities. Lian argues that sanctioning China within the Swift system would inflict serious damage on the system itself, potentially leading countries to shift to China’s alternative, CIPS. His remarks highlight the growing concerns over financial warfare amid rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

This criticism follows a court panel's decision against Trump's tariffs, a ruling that put him at odds with some conservative legal theories. Trump expressed disappointment in the Federalist Society, suggesting they provided poor advice on judicial nominations and referred to Leo's work with the Teneo Network. The clash underscores the growing tensions between Trump and elements of the conservative legal movement, particularly concerning judicial appointments and legal doctrines.</p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has declined significantly this year, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association, due to tariffs and tightened border policies. The survey showed that nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year. A third of business travel buyers said their companies have either changed or are considering changing policies regarding travel to or from the United States. Business travel professionals expressed concerns about the potential for long-term impact caused by decisions of the Trump Administration this year, led by worries over business travel costs.

          <p>Jewish foreign students at Harvard University are expressing fear and uncertainty amid the ongoing conflict between the university and the Trump administration. The administration's efforts to restrict international student enrollment have raised concerns among students who fear becoming collateral damage. While some students express pride in Harvard's defense of academic freedom, others worry about the potential impact on their studies and future. The situation has led to accusations that President Trump has politicized antisemitism.</p>

Kell Morris' wife held his head above water while waiting for rescuers, who were transported to the remote location by a sled dog tourism company's helicopter. Rescuers used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder off him as he drifted in and out of consciousness.

          <p>President Trump's power to unilaterally impose tariffs is under threat after a US Court of International Trade ruled that he exceeded his authority, but a federal appeals court has stayed the trade court's ruling, which means that those tariffs will stay in place - for now. The administration argued in its appeal that a ruling against Trump "would kneecap the president on the world stage, cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals, imperil the government's ability to respond to these and future national emergencies". Trump has frequently used tariffs as an economic weapon, but this legal challenge could limit his ability to do so. (not investment advice)</p>
