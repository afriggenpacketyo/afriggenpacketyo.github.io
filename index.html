          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Vance Luther Boelter with six federal counts, including stalking, murder, and firearms offenses, in connection with the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and the shooting of Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Boelter allegedly went to the homes of four Minnesota state lawmakers early Saturday morning with the intent to kill them, including one lawmaker who was not home. The FBI says that Boelter planned his attacks carefully, researching the victims and their families, and conducting surveillance of their homes. The arrest followed a 43-hour manhunt. This act of political violence is deeply concerning.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has seen Israeli attacks targeting Iran's energy infrastructure, including vital oil storage sites, refineries, and the South Pars gas field. This attack has forced Tehran to partially suspend production at the field, raising concerns about Iranian energy production and supply. Iran is a major player in the global energy sector, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves and third-largest crude reserves. Sanctions and geopolitical tensions have crippled the Iranian economy, leading to energy shortages and blackouts despite its vast hydrocarbon reserves.

The report also recommends tightening the law so adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault. The government has pledged to change the law and conduct a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation. The topic is difficult and sensitive.</p>

          <h2>Casey Report Highlights Ethnicity Data Gaps in Grooming Gang Cases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey highlights that the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gang cases is often not recorded, hindering accurate assessment. The report found that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators, making it difficult to draw national conclusions. However, local data from three police forces shows a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects. The report criticizes the authorities' failure to understand the nature and scale of the problem and recommends tightening laws and launching a national inquiry. The topic is sensitive and difficult.</p>
