          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly condemned the actions of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a New York Times op-ed, they argue that his decisions, including the recent firing of the CDC's director and the dismantling of vaccine advisory committees, are undermining the nation's public health system. The former leaders, whose tenures span both Republican and Democratic administrations, warn that these moves weaken the country's ability to respond to future pandemics and other health threats. They are calling on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department to address what they describe as an alarming situation for America's health security.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Nevada are conducting a homicide investigation after a man was found deceased in a pool of blood at the annual Burning Man festival. The discovery was made on Saturday evening as the event's signature "Man" effigy was being burned, prompting a significant law enforcement response in the temporary desert city. The victim has not yet been identified, and police are facing the challenge of investigating a serious crime at a venue that will disappear within days. Organizers are cooperating with the investigation and have urged festival attendees to remain vigilant while respecting the cordoned-off crime scene.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has finalized deals for two of its forwards, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Italian champions Napoli and Antony moving to Spanish club Real Betis. Hojlund's move is a season-long loan that includes a mandatory £38 million purchase clause, making the transfer permanent next summer. Antony, who joined United for over £81 million in 2022, completes a permanent £21.65 million transfer to Real Betis on a five-year contract following a successful loan spell there last season. These transfers represent significant moves for the club as it reshapes its attacking lineup for the current and future seasons.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS signal disruption while approaching Bulgaria, an incident the European Commission suspects was caused by Russian interference. While the aircraft landed safely, the event has heightened concerns across Europe about the increasing prevalence of GPS jamming and spoofing, particularly near Russian territory. This incident is seen as part of a broader pattern of hostile actions by Russia intended to create instability and undermine European security. In response, the EU has stated the event will reinforce its commitment to bolstering its own defense capabilities and its support for Ukraine.</p>

Known for its massive size, exceptionally clean restrooms, and extensive food offerings like fresh barbecue, the chain has cultivated a loyal following. Brand experts compare the experience to the "Disneyland of the convenience store industry," highlighting its focus on creating a joyful and memorable pit stop rather than just a place to refuel.

          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace for the transfer of England center-back Marc Guehi, pending final clearance from the selling club. The 25-year-old defender is set to sign a long-term contract after completing a medical, with the clubs reaching a compromise on a fee initially offered at £35 million. However, Crystal Palace is reportedly delaying the final sanction of the transfer until they secure a suitable replacement. The move is part of a significant summer spending spree for Liverpool, aimed at strengthening their defense after conceding multiple goals in their opening matches of the season.</p>

          <p>The medical examiner's office in Alexandria, Virginia, has determined the cause of death for former U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber, who passed away in her sleep in March at the age of 43. The official cause was cited as "sudden unexpected death in epilepsy," a condition her family had previously stated she lived with for many years. Aber served as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia from 2021 until January 2025, a role in which she prosecuted high-profile cases involving national security. Police had previously stated that there was no evidence of foul play, and the medical examiner's findings confirm her death was due to natural causes.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have recently detained at least 11 United Nations personnel in the capital, Sanaa, in a move analysts believe is a response to both external and internal pressures. The raids on UN offices followed a deadly Israeli airstrike on a Houthi cabinet meeting, for which the group has vowed revenge. Experts suggest the detentions are part of a broader internal security crackdown fueled by paranoia about foreign spies, with international aid workers becoming a "default target" during times of crisis. This action is consistent with a years-long pattern of the Houthis abducting aid workers and other civilians as bargaining chips and to consolidate power.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has left a trail of devastation, with eyewitnesses describing entire villages being destroyed and residents too shocked to speak. A freelance journalist who reached the remote, mountainous region reported seeing numerous casualties and helping to dig graves, noting that many people were trapped under the rubble of their collapsed homes. Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads and the difficult terrain, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters.

          <p>Following a congressional decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are grappling with significant budget shortfalls.

National networks are reducing dues to help ease the burden, and a philanthropic effort is underway to support the hardest-hit stations.

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta by releasing a satirical short story. The move came after her classic dystopian novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was among more than 200 books removed from some school libraries under a new policy targeting "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story satirizes the ban's premise by describing perfectly chaste characters, while also criticizing the provincial leadership.

By analyzing over 225,000 animal bones from the past 8,000 years, scientists found that wild species like deer and foxes began to shrink, while domesticated species such as cattle and chickens grew larger. This divergence is attributed to increasing human influence, including the fragmentation of wild habitats and the intensification of selective breeding for livestock. The findings demonstrate the profound and lasting impact of human activities on the natural world, altering the evolutionary trajectory of multiple species over the last millennium.</p>

          <p>Iconic American apparel company Levi's has warned that "rising anti-Americanism" resulting from the Trump administration's tariffs and foreign policies could negatively impact its sales in the United Kingdom. In its UK financial report, the company listed potential shifts in consumer sentiment towards national or European brands as a key business risk. While the company reported strong sales growth, the disclosure highlights corporate anxiety over the potential for political policies to create a backlash against prominent U.S. brands in overseas markets. Levi's is one of the first major American companies to publicly voice such concerns in its official filings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government-owned rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently scrapped higher-priced peak-time tickets in an effort to simplify fares and encourage more train travel. This move, which significantly reduces the cost of a rush-hour commute, was made possible by changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, which have left more capacity on traditionally busy trains. The decision has sparked a debate about whether England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could adopt a similar model. While passengers welcome cheaper fares, experts are divided on the potential consequences, with some warning of possible overcrowding on certain routes or future price hikes to offset lost revenue.</p>

          <p>A recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States is under threat as President Donald Trump has warned of fresh tariffs in response to Europe's digital services taxes. The Trump administration argues that these taxes, along with new technology regulations like the Digital Services Act, unfairly target major U.S. tech companies such as Google and Meta. The threat has caught EU officials off guard and reignited transatlantic trade tensions that were thought to have been eased. The dispute places Brussels in a difficult position, balancing its sovereign right to regulate its digital market with the risk of a damaging trade war.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, who served as the Member of Parliament for Somerton and Frome until his resignation in 2023, has died suddenly at the age of 59. Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton was first elected as a Conservative in 2015 but was suspended from the party in 2022 following claims of sexual misconduct, which he denied and which were later withdrawn. He ultimately resigned his seat after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election. A former colleague remembered him as a talented and passionate defender of his constituents in Somerset.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The decision largely upholds a lower court ruling but allows the tariffs to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The case challenges the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the duties by declaring U.S. trade deficits a national emergency. The ruling represents a significant legal setback for one of the administration's cornerstone economic policies and could have major implications for presidential trade power.</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, causing hundreds of fatalities and widespread destruction in the mountainous Nangarhar and Kunar provinces. The shallow depth of the quake contributed to its destructive power, and rescue operations are severely hampered by the remote terrain and landslides that have blocked access roads. The country's ability to cope with the disaster is compromised by its ongoing economic crisis following the Taliban's takeover, which led to the suspension of most foreign aid. The situation is particularly dire for women and girls, whose access to life-saving services is already limited by Taliban restrictions.</p>
