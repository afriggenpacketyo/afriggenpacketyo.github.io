          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a dominant figure in Washington, eclipsing the political influence once held by Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. His successful lobbying efforts, aligning with the Trump administration's strategic goals, have been pivotal in decisions like resuming sales of certain AI chips to China. This shift highlights the geopolitical importance of Nvidia's technology in the global AI race and its impact on U.S.-China trade dynamics. Huang's ascendancy underscores how central advanced semiconductors have become to national power and international relations.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization has strongly condemned the Israeli military for repeatedly storming its facilities in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. According to the WHO, Israeli forces entered a staff residence, mistreated occupants, detained staff members, and damaged a main warehouse crucial for medical supplies. The incidents have been described as crippling to the entire health response in the region, prompting international calls for an immediate ceasefire and for foreign press to be granted access to Gaza. The WHO has vowed to continue its operations despite the attacks.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly preparing to use its "Anti-Coercion Instrument" (ACI), a powerful but unused tool, in response to potential U.S. tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. This "trade bazooka" could restrict U.S. suppliers' access to EU markets, including public contracts, and impose limits on goods, services, and investments. The move is being considered as a last resort to deter what the EU views as economic coercion, particularly the looming threat of a 30% tariff on its imports. The ACI aims to de-escalate trade disputes through dialogue but provides a strong retaliatory option if necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have observed that recent days, including July 22, are slightly shorter than the standard 24 hours by a few milliseconds. This phenomenon, while not uncommon, is caused by a combination of factors including the moon's gravitational pull, atmospheric winds, and movements in the planet's liquid core. While the long-term trend is for days to lengthen, a recent spate of faster spins has sparked public interest and discussion about a potential "negative leap second," an unprecedented adjustment. Experts emphasize that these minor variations are scientifically interesting but have no immediate impact on daily life.</p>

More than two years after his diagnosis, which typically carries a 15-month average survival, his scans remain clear. This remarkable outcome has provided hope and prompted a new, larger clinical trial for the same drug in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients.</p>

          <p>A detailed report reveals the internal divisions and high-stakes negotiations within the House Republican conference to pass President Trump's signature "megabill." The process involved all-night sessions, a dramatic last-minute vote change, and direct intervention from the White House to sway holdout members from the party's hard-line conservative faction. To secure the necessary votes, the Trump administration reportedly made several concessions through executive orders and other actions, bypassing House leadership. The contentious passage highlights the fragile GOP majority and the complex dynamics that will shape future legislative battles, including upcoming government funding debates.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration's effort to reduce long wait times on its national 800 number has created new problems by reassigning field office employees, including vital claims specialists. While phone wait times have reportedly improved, workers and union representatives say the move has severely strained local offices, increasing workloads and delaying other essential services for beneficiaries. This "robbing Peter to pay Paul" strategy is a symptom of chronic understaffing at the agency, which has seen thousands of employees leave in recent months.

          <p>The projected cost of constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, UK, has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. To fund the project, the government has taken a 44.9% stake and secured investment from private firms, which will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during the construction phase. Officials state the plant, expected to operate in the mid-2030s, will power six million homes and create thousands of jobs. Critics, however, decry the escalating costs and argue the public is shouldering the financial risk for inevitable overruns. (not investment advice)</p>

However, critics within Slovakia argue the move was a "show" to distract from internal problems like a high budget deficit, a structural economic crisis, and corruption scandals. This strategy of creating a conflict with "Brussels bureaucrats" before backing down mirrors tactics used by his ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</p>

Farmer voiced skepticism about the Trump administration's handling of the files and criticized the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey. Motivated by the recent suicide of fellow accuser Virginia Giuffre, she is speaking out against calls to pardon Maxwell and to seek a better understanding of the justice system's failures.</p>

          <p>Interior ministers from the 27 EU member states are gathering in Copenhagen to discuss strategies for managing irregular migration and combating organized crime. Key topics on the agenda include enhancing the repatriation process for rejected asylum seekers and fighting the drug trade. The talks come as some members, including Germany, advocate for a stricter European migration policy, potentially including the establishment of repatriation centers outside the EU. This meeting reflects the ongoing political pressure within the bloc to create a more cohesive and stringent approach to border security and asylum procedures.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan Attorney General's office has launched an investigation into allegations that over 250 Venezuelan migrants were tortured in El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. The migrants were deported from the U.S. under a rarely used law and held in the maximum-security facility before being returned to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange. Attorney General Tarek Saab presented videos of former detainees describing severe mistreatment, including beatings and sexual assault. The investigation targets top El Salvadoran officials, including President Nayib Bukele, for the alleged human rights abuses against the detained Venezuelans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the widespread practice of film censorship, where countries alter Hollywood movies to conform to local cultural, religious, or political standards. Examples range from India shortening a kiss in "Superman" to China creating an entirely different, more state-friendly ending for "Minions: The Rise of Gru." Censors in various nations digitally alter scenes to cover nudity, remove LGBTQ+ content, or mute profanity. The report also highlights the trend of Hollywood studios self-censoring or creating alternate versions of their films to gain access to lucrative but restrictive markets like China, raising concerns about artistic integrity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 240,000 pages of FBI surveillance records on the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The release proceeded despite opposition from the King family, who argued the files should be viewed with full historical context and respect for their personal grief. The King Center, led by his daughter Bernice King, called the release "ill-timed" and a distraction from current injustices. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton echoed this, suggesting it was a "desperate attempt" to divert attention from other issues, such as the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

Those targeted include gang leaders, boat suppliers, and middlemen facilitating payments through informal networks. This move is a central part of the Labour government's pledge to "smash" these criminal networks, though critics question whether targeting individuals can be a "game changer" for the overall issue.</p>
