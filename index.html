            <p>The State Department has drastically reduced foreign aid by $1.3 billion, terminating USAID contracts for food, water, and medicine in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, and other countries. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce stated that 85% of USAID programs with the World Food Program remain active, while some programs were cut due to concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups or due to misuse of cash-based assistance. The World Food Programme warned that these cuts could amount to a "death sentence for millions," prompting urgent appeals for continued support. The cuts were reportedly ordered by Jeremy Lewin, the USAID deputy administrator for policy. </p>

            <p>The UK government is investigating potential fraud involving Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) diesel, a fuel marketed as a green alternative. Whistleblowers allege that virgin palm oil, linked to deforestation, is being fraudulently relabeled as waste material in HVO production. Data suggests that Europe is using more palm sludge waste for biofuels than the world can produce, raising suspicions of non-waste materials being used. The Department for Transport is taking these concerns seriously and is gathering more information, and the Irish authorities have restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that the measles outbreak in Texas is slowing down, but data from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates cases are still increasing. Public health specialists are skeptical of Kennedy's claim and believe the actual number of cases is likely higher than reported. They caution against suggesting the curve is flattening, as it could dissuade people from getting tested or treated. Experts also highlighted the importance of the MMR vaccine in preventing measles.</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot ban Associated Press (AP) reporters from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other secure spaces where other journalists are admitted. The judge stated that the White House's actions violated the First Amendment. The AP had sued after being blocked from certain events following a dispute over the news agency's use of "Gulf of Mexico" instead of "Gulf of America." The White House has been ordered to restore AP's access, but the order is temporarily stayed to allow for a potential appeal.</p>

            <p>Measles, which was officially "eliminated" from the United States 25 years ago, is now spreading again, particularly in West Texas and New Mexico. The term "eliminated" in public health means that measles has not had a steady twelve-month spread. There are measles cases in several states, with the biggest number of cases in West Texas where two children have died. The article explores what measures are needed to control the resurgence of the virus.</p>

            <p>Stocks declined after the U.S. announced it would impose a 104% tariff on China, reversing earlier gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also declined. The sell-off is attributed to anxieties about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, with economists warning of potential inflation and recession. The tariff escalation follows China's retaliatory measures and adds to the ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
