        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wendy McMahon stepped down as CEO of CBS News following disagreements with Paramount Global's leadership, particularly Shari Redstone. Tensions arose over increased board scrutiny of "60 Minutes" programming, leading to the resignation of executive producer Bill Owens over concerns about journalistic independence. Redstone also criticized McMahon for fairness and balance issues in CBS's coverage, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. McMahon felt pressured to fight for certain stories to air, given the board's preference against them, and she ultimately resigned after realizing she and the company had differing visions for the future.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to secure votes for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a megabill aimed at advancing President Trump's legislative agenda.

          <p>In Sean Combs's racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking trial, singer Dawn Richard testified about witnessing Combs physically abuse his former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura. Richard described multiple incidents of violence, including Combs punching, kicking, and slapping Ventura, even attempting to hit her with a skillet. She recounted advising Ventura to leave the relationship but was warned by Combs to stay out of it. The defense scrutinized Richard's account, questioning inconsistencies in her statements over time, while the prosecution aims to prove that Ventura was a victim of sex trafficking during her relationship with Combs. The article states that Richard's testimony is part of a series of government witnesses expected to testify about what they saw of Ms. Ventura's relationship with Mr. Combs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration's takeover of the United States Institute of Peace, reinstating the fired board members and president. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that Trump exceeded his authority by attempting to dismantle the organization and seize its assets. The court determined that USIP is part of the federal government but not the executive branch, making Trump's actions unlawful. The ruling voids transfers of assets, including the institute's headquarters, and criticizes the administration's actions as a gross usurpation of power.</p>

A sketch featuring bridesmaids singing about "Domingo" became a viral phenomenon, leading to multiple appearances. The anniversary special delivered a classic SNL experience, and Ego Nwodim's "Weekend Update" segment as Miss Eggy was memorable. </p>

          <p>The article discusses what 100% home equity means for homeowners and their borrowing options. Having 100% equity means your mortgage balance is paid off, but lenders typically limit borrowing to 80%-90% of the home's value. With 100% equity, homeowners are positioned for better rates and terms due to being less risky borrowers. The article compares home equity loans and HELOCs, noting that HELOCs may be more attractive due to lower rates and potential for future rate cuts, while home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates.</p>

          <p>Wynn Resorts has withdrawn its bid for a casino license in New York, citing better uses for its capital after facing years of opposition. This follows Las Vegas Sands' decision to drop its pursuit of a license for the Nassau Coliseum site due to potential competition from iGaming. Casino executives have complained about the politicized and expensive process of obtaining a New York casino license. Wynn plans to focus on stock buybacks and existing developments, including a casino resort in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's diagnosis with advanced prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has prompted questions about screening and the disease's progression. While the exact timeline is unclear, the aggressive nature of the cancer, categorized as Grade Group 5, led to its rapid spread. Experts note that prostate cancer screenings are not routinely recommended for men over 70, which is why Biden did not undergo screening during his last medical checkup. His diagnosis came after he sought medical attention for urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule in his prostate.</p>
