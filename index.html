        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges. This plea deal spares him the death penalty, resulting in four consecutive life sentences plus ten years for burglary, with no right to appeal. The agreement was reached after Kohberger's defense approached prosecutors, who then consulted with the victims' families, believing this resolution ensures a conviction and avoids decades of appeals. Sentencing is anticipated for late July, bringing a conclusion to a case that garnered national attention and led to a seven-week manhunt.</p>

          <p>The Senate is proceeding with a marathon voting session on amendments to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a sweeping tax and immigration package. Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation before the July 4th deadline, while Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" to introduce numerous amendments highlighting cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Despite some Republican opposition, including from Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins on certain measures, the GOP leadership has so far defeated all Democratic efforts to significantly alter the bill. The legislation's passage remains contentious as it moves toward a final vote in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision that will create 800 American jobs. An executive stated that while reshoring aligns with the company's long-term strategy of manufacturing products closer to their consumers, recent U.S. trade policies and tariffs on Chinese imports accelerated the move. The new facility is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production. The company is now hiring for various roles, including engineering and supply chain positions.</p>

His criticism focuses on what he calls "insane" spending levels and a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU argued that the act is intended for major wars, not for targeting a criminal gang, and that the administration's "predatory incursion" claim does not meet the legal standard. However, the judges questioned whether they have the authority to overrule a presidential determination of an armed conflict. The Justice Department defended the president's authority, citing FBI assessments of the gang's threat within the United States.</p>

This decision provides legal certainty for same-sex couples and is being hailed as a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights advocates.

This resolution now allows WGA members to work with Emmett and his current production company, Convergence Entertainment Group.

Legal experts express concern that the administration will use civil litigation, which has a lower burden of proof and does not guarantee a right to an attorney.

          <p>The United States is developing a multibillion-dollar missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," intended to protect the nation from long-range missile threats and enhance deterrence against China. The project, initiated by an executive order from President Trump, would utilize a network of satellites and space-based sensors for missile interception. Analysts believe that if successfully implemented, the system could significantly bolster U.S. defensive capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in a potential conflict scenario involving Taiwan.

          <p>Despite concerns that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists suggest this is due to several short-term strategies employed by businesses to absorb the initial shock. Companies have been front-loading inventory, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While these tactics have buffered the immediate impact, experts caution that prices are still likely to rise in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stanford University has announced a $140 million budget cut for the upcoming academic year, a move the administration attributes to "consequences from federal policy changes." In a letter to staff, the university president and provost cited reductions in federal research support and the impact of a potential endowment tax as key factors. These cuts are expected to lead to staff layoffs, though faculty hiring will continue at a slower pace. The university, which has one of the nation's largest endowments, stated it must be realistic about the current financial landscape while continuing to advocate for university funding.

          <p>The annual Fourth of July celebrations may be impacted by U.S. trade policy, as tariffs on Chinese goods are affecting the fireworks industry. With over 95% of U.S. fireworks imported from China, a 30% tariff has created supply chain disruptions and is expected to lead to higher prices and reduced selection for consumers. According to the American Pyrotechnics Association, many importers paused shipments when a much higher tariff rate was initially proposed, creating a supply problem ahead of the busiest sales week. Major vendors have indicated that price increases on some products are likely.</p>

This rhetorical strategy is described as a form of nihilism that undermines America's standing as a leader of the free world. The piece concludes that this narrative is poisonous to democracy.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed reconciliation bill currently in the Senate could cause 11.8 million Americans to lose health insurance by 2034, primarily through significant changes to Medicaid.

Health policy experts warn these changes could be devastating for vulnerable populations, particularly older adults who may struggle to meet work requirements due to health issues or caregiving responsibilities.

The decision is part of a broader effort to ensure "value for money" in royal finances, as a single two-day trip on the train recently cost over Â£44,000. The nine-carriage train has been used infrequently in recent years, raising questions about its high maintenance and storage costs. Before being decommissioned, the train will take a final tour around the UK, after which it may be put on public display.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed its largest air attack on Ukraine over the weekend since the full-scale invasion began, launching over 500 drones and missiles across the country. The massive barrage targeted various regions, including areas in Western Ukraine that are far from the front lines and not typically subjected to such intense bombardment. The scale of the assault marks a significant escalation in Russia's air campaign. Ukrainian officials and correspondents on the ground are reporting on the widespread nature of the attacks and assessing the extensive damage caused by the bombardment.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings on a $10,000 Deposit in Short-Term CDs vs. Money Market Accounts</h2>

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, both short-term CDs and money market accounts are offering attractive returns, but their structures differ. This article compares the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit in each. With current rates, a 3-month or 6-month CD would earn slightly more than a money market account, while a money market account would outperform a 9-month CD. However, CD rates are fixed, providing a guaranteed return, whereas money market rates are variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this year as expected.

          <h2>Twenty Bodies, Some Decapitated, Discovered in Mexican State of Sinaloa Amid Cartel Infighting</h2>

          <p>Authorities in the Mexican state of Sinaloa have discovered 20 bodies on a highway bridge, with several of the victims having been decapitated. The gruesome discovery is believed to be the result of escalating violence between warring factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel. The conflict pits loyalists of the recently captured Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada against a faction led by the sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. The violence in the state has surged in the past year, with this incident marking a particularly brutal display in the ongoing cartel power struggle.</p>
