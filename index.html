          <p>The Trump administration has broadened its capacity for mass deportations by securing a third-country agreement with Rwanda to accept up to 250 individuals. This deal is part of a larger strategy to partner with nations willing to take in deportees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Other nations like Eswatini, South Sudan, Costa Rica, and Panama have also recently accepted deportees from the U.S. under various arrangements. These efforts, particularly those involving El Salvador, have drawn criticism from some U.S. lawmakers but have been championed by the administration as a key part of its immigration policy.</p>

Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," where an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft, but the crew managed a safe return to Earth. He also flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon. NASA and his family remembered him as a hero whose steadfast courage and unshakeable optimism inspired millions and contributed significantly to the future of space exploration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Pentagon to prepare a range of military options for potential use against drug cartels, which the administration recently designated as foreign terrorist organizations. While officials state that military action is not imminent, the directive authorizes planning for operations against groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and Tren de Aragua. The move follows statements from Secretary of State Marco Rubio about using all elements of American power against these groups. Mexico's president has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention on its soil.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old boy is recovering after being attacked by a coyote during his sister's softball game at a park in Carson, California. The incident, partially captured on video, shows the coyote biting and scratching the boy before his mother ran to his aid and scared the animal away. The child, Enoch Palomar, received 20 stitches for a leg wound and also sustained bites to his head and neck. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is investigating the attack, noting that while coyotes typically avoid humans, they can become conditioned to rely on human food sources.</p>

This declaration follows the Trump administration's designation of several Latin American cartels as terrorist organizations, a move that U.S. officials say allows for a broader range of actions against them, including potential military targeting.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from a lawsuit by PETA over the alleged mistreatment of chimpanzees, including Tonka, who appeared in the film "George of the Jungle." Haddix falsely claimed Tonka had died to avoid surrendering him to a sanctuary as ordered by a court. The chimp was later found alive in her basement, and another chimp was discovered there just last month, leading to her arrest and bond revocation.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the key reasons why a person might be disqualified from filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, a process that has seen a recent increase in filings. Common disqualifiers include failing the income-based means test for Chapter 7, having a recent bankruptcy discharge, or not completing mandatory credit counseling. Additionally, actions considered fraudulent, such as hiding assets, lying on forms, or making large luxury purchases just before filing, can lead to rejection and potential criminal charges. The article also suggests alternatives like debt consolidation or settlement for those who do not qualify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, sharply criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's condemnation of Israel's plan to take over Gaza City. In a social media post, Huckabee suggested the UK would have lost World War Two with Starmer as its leader, comparing the situation to surrendering to the Nazis. Starmer had called Israel's decision "wrong" and warned it would only lead to more bloodshed rather than securing the release of hostages. The Israeli plan has faced widespread international criticism, including from Germany, which announced it would suspend arms exports to Israel.</p>

          <p>The Boar's Head plant in Jarratt, Virginia, which was shut down last year after a deadly listeria outbreak, is set to reopen in the coming months. The USDA has lifted its suspension, stating the facility is now in full compliance. However, recent inspection reports from other Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana, and Virginia reveal ongoing sanitation problems similar to those that caused the outbreak, including leftover meat on equipment and blocked drains. Food safety advocates have expressed concern over the findings, questioning the company's commitment to systemic change and federal oversight of the brand.</p>

          <p>A watchdog group, the Democracy Defenders Fund, has requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family on behalf of President Trump. The group asked the Department of Defense's inspector general and the GAO to determine if the acceptance was improper and if taxpayer funds are being misused. The memo raises concerns that the Pentagon is diverting nearly $1 billion from a nuclear missile program to retrofit the gifted aircraft, which the group argues is a redundant and wasteful expense that may violate federal law.</p>

          <p>While much of the global focus on falling birth rates has been on East Asian nations, Latin American countries like Chile are also experiencing a significant demographic shift. This article explores the factors contributing to Chile's plummeting fertility rate. It delves into the personal decisions and societal changes driving this trend in the nation's capital, Santiago. The decline in birth rates presents long-term economic and social challenges for the country, mirroring a pattern that is becoming increasingly widespread across different regions of the world, moving beyond the traditionally highlighted areas of Europe and Asia.</p>

          <p>Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan sent a memo to employees addressing what he called "misinformation" after President Trump demanded his immediate resignation over alleged conflicts of interest. The controversy stems from concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton about Tan's past associations with Chinese companies and the potential security risks for Intel, a recipient of U.S. taxpayer funds. In his letter, Tan defended his four-decade career, stating he has always operated with the highest ethical standards. He affirmed that Intel is working with the White House and that the company's board fully supports its current direction.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to sell stock in government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially creating one of the largest stock offerings in history. According to The Wall Street Journal, administration officials are discussing valuations for the companies that could exceed $500 billion. Leaders of major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have met with President Trump to discuss the plans. This complex deal would end the government's conservatorship of the two firms, which began during the 2008 financial crisis, and return them to private shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is set to peak next week, but viewing conditions are expected to be poor. The peak on August 12-13 coincides with a waning gibbous moon that will be 84% full, creating significant light pollution in the night sky. According to the American Meteor Society, the bright moonlight will reduce the number of visible meteors by at least 75%, with viewers likely to see only 10-20 per hour instead of the usual 50 or more. For better viewing, experts suggest looking for meteors a week after the peak when the moon is less bright.</p>

          <p>Five years after the largest protests in Belarus's history erupted against the rigged 2020 presidential election, Alexander Lukashenko's autocratic rule remains firmly in place. The mass uprising, which saw hundreds of thousands protest, was met with a violent crackdown and has been followed by years of severe repression, with over 60,000 people imprisoned for political reasons. With Russia's backing, Lukashenko has consolidated power, erased digital traces of the protests, and continues to persecute dissenters. Despite releasing some political prisoners, the regime shows no signs of genuine political change, leaving the democratic movement suppressed and largely in exile.</p>

The ban has been condemned by Islamic organizations as discriminatory and Islamophobic, and even Spain's Catholic bishops have warned it violates fundamental rights.

This move, part of the EU's sanctions against Russia, aims to curb funding for the war in Ukraine. However, experts believe this will have a limited impact on the broader EU-India trade negotiations. A more significant pressure point for India is the threat of high U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically push New Delhi to finalize a free trade agreement with the EU to secure a more predictable economic partnership.</p>
