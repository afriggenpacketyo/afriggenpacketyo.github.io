          <p>A severe thunderstorm with high winds struck central New Jersey, resulting in multiple fatalities and widespread damage. The towns of Plainfield and North Plainfield were particularly affected, with Plainfield's mayor declaring a state of emergency. Due to the tragic loss of life and extensive destruction, Plainfield has canceled its planned Fourth of July parade, concert, and fireworks display. Governor Phil Murphy urged residents to remain indoors to avoid dangers like downed power lines and fallen trees as recovery efforts begin.</p>

          <p>Hamas is currently consulting with other Palestinian factions before formally responding to a new US-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage exchange in Gaza. The plan, which Israel has reportedly accepted, suggests a 60-day truce, the release of some hostages, and negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict. Meanwhile, Israeli military strikes continue across Gaza, with recent attacks resulting in more Palestinian casualties. In Tel Aviv, families of hostages are rallying in support of a deal to secure the release of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of a massive tax and policy bill, Republicans and Democrats are now focused on shaping public opinion. Republicans are highlighting provisions like permanent tax cuts, increased defense spending, and border security funding as promises kept to their voters. Conversely, Democrats are drawing attention to potential cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and SNAP, which the CBO estimates could cause millions to lose coverage. Polling indicates public opposition to the bill, but opinions are more divided on specific elements like work requirements for benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton advanced to the third round of Wimbledon after his match, which was suspended due to darkness, resumed for just one minute. Shelton was leading Rinky Hijikata and only needed to complete a single service game to clinch the victory. Despite his frustration with the previous night's suspension, Shelton expressed confidence in his serve and efficiently closed out the match. He will now face Marton Focsovics as he aims to continue his run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>A court has heard that a widely filmed brawl at Manchester airport last year involved two brothers assaulting three police officers. The incident allegedly began when one brother, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, headbutted and punched a man in a Starbucks cafe. When police attempted to arrest him, he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, are accused of resisting and assaulting the officers, leaving one with a broken nose. The prosecution asserts that the events are clearly captured on CCTV, while the defendants claim they were acting in self-defense.</p>

          <p>Community volunteers in Springfield, Ohio, are urgently helping Haitian families apply for U.S. passports for their American-born children. This effort comes as the Trump administration announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, who could face deportation proceedings by September. Without passports, thousands of U.S. citizen children could become stateless or be separated from their parents if they are forced to leave the country. The situation is compounded by the dire security crisis in Haiti, making a return unsafe.</p>

The box office victory highlights Apple's strength in long-term investment and marketing, growing its services business into a cultural force. However, its recent AI announcements were met with a muted response, as the company has yet to deliver a sophisticated, conversational Siri to compete with rivals from Google and OpenAI. This lag in AI development is becoming a growing concern for investors and observers. (not investment advice)</p>

Another notable trend is the rise of chef-led brands bringing restaurant-quality sauces and foods to home kitchens.

          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic Park series, 'Jurassic World Rebirth,' is being criticized as a pointless and uninspired sequel. The film attempts to reset the franchise by returning to a remote jungle island, but the plot is a derivative mix of previous sequels. Despite some impressive scale and clean action sequences from director Gareth Edwards, the movie suffers from a lack of memorable characters and narrative stakes. The ensemble cast, including Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, is wasted on a plodding script that fails to recapture the original's sense of awe.</p>

Experts believe a comprehensive deal is unlikely in the short timeframe, with the most probable outcome being a preliminary agreement that might accept a 10% baseline U.S. tariff to avoid steeper duties on key sectors like automobiles.
