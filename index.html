          <p>James Comey addressed the controversy surrounding his recent Instagram post featuring the number '8647' written in seashells on a beach, claiming it was an innocent coincidence discovered during a walk with his wife. Comey explained that his wife interpreted '86' as a term for removing an item from a menu, while he recalled it meaning 'to ditch a place' from his childhood. Despite the innocent explanation, the post sparked accusations from Trump allies, leading to a Secret Service investigation and Comey voluntarily appearing for an interview at the Washington field office. Comey warned against the administration's use of power to target individuals and erode the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court injunction, allowing them to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The TPS program, established in 1990, provides temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing wars or natural disasters, offering work permits and deportation deferrals. The Trump administration argued that continuing the program was "contrary to the national interest," while advocates for TPS beneficiaries warned that ending the protections would cause significant harm. The case is one of several involving the Trump administration's immigration policies to reach the Supreme Court.</p>

The judge described the murder as exceptionally gruesome, emphasizing the suffering Todd endured in his final moments.

          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential fiscal plans that could increase the federal deficit, has intensified the debate over a proposed tax and spending cut package. Fiscally conservative Republicans, already hesitant about the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the deficit, are now using the downgrade to bolster their demands for deeper cuts to federal programs. While the downgrade may strengthen their arguments, it's uncertain whether it will significantly alter the bill's progress, as Republican leaders navigate competing concerns from both fiscal hawks and moderate Republicans wary of cutting social programs.</p>

He drew parallels to previous downgrades in 2011 and 2023, noting that market declines following those events were not justified by the underlying economic conditions. Cramer suggested that investors should view the downgrade as a warning to save and invest more, rather than a signal to sell off their portfolios. He cautioned against succumbing to fear, arguing that those who promote such sentiment are either misinformed or have a vested interest in creating market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are discussing the implications and potential progression of the disease. The diagnosis has also resurfaced questions about Biden's decision to run for reelection last year and the transparency surrounding his health. Experts noted that it is not uncommon for prostate cancer to be diagnosed in its later stages, especially in older men. Some questioned whether Biden underwent regular PSA testing during his presidency. Despite the diagnosis, experts emphasized that treatment for prostate cancer has greatly advanced.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of prostate cancer, here's what to know about the disease. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men. Early prostate cancer often causes no symptoms, but advanced cancer can cause urinary problems, erectile dysfunction, and pain. Screening tests include PSA tests and digital rectal exams. Treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer, ranging from active surveillance to surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy. Survival rates are high for localized cancer, but lower for cancer that has spread.</p>
