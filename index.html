          <h2>China Prioritizes Yuan Stability Amidst Trade Tariff Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 01:34:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions and US tariff hikes, China's central bank is signaling a preference for yuan stability over devaluation. The People’s Bank of China has set the yuan’s daily reference rate to a four-month low, but analysts note that it has avoided breaching the critical 7.2 benchmark against the US dollar. This move suggests that the central bank aims to stabilize the currency rather than sharply devalue it to offset the impact of US tariffs. Standard Chartered's chief Greater China economist, Ding Shuang, believes the central bank will maintain this strategy until the next round of tariffs is announced.

          <p>Amidst rising trade tensions and fears of a US recession following President Trump's tariff announcements, investors are seeking safe-haven assets. Analysts suggest the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc as prime candidates for investment hedges. Absolute Strategy Research's Ebrahim Rahbari notes the yen is cheap, US interest rate declines will narrow rate differentials, and Japan's reliance on trade is lower. Raymond James Investment Management's Matt Orton expects the Swiss franc to act as a better hedge given the Bank of Japan's rate hike uncertainty. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 01:20:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many workers desire flexible working arrangements, but employers often don't explicitly advertise them. Flexa CEO Molly Johnson-Jones suggests subtly inquiring about a company's culture during job interviews to gauge their openness to flexibility. Asking about the working environment and how success is measured can reveal whether employees have autonomy and control over their schedules. Inquiring about a 'typical' workday can also indicate whether employees have set hours or can adjust their workdays to accommodate personal needs.</p>

          <p>A recent earthquake in Myanmar, one of the strongest in a century, has deepened the country's political turmoil amidst an ongoing civil war. While the ruling junta has declared a state of emergency and requested international aid, analysts are skeptical that this will lead to a lasting peace settlement between the junta and resistance forces. Angshuman Choudhury notes that the battle lines are too deeply etched, and the junta is likely to use the aftermath of the quake to degrade resistance capabilities. The military has declared a temporary ceasefire to support humanitarian efforts, but warns it will respond to any rebel attacks.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering its response to the global economic turmoil caused by President Trump's recent tariff announcements. While other nations are promising retaliation, the UK is taking a measured approach, weighing economic and political factors. Retaliation could prove popular domestically and align the UK with its G7 counterparts, but it could also jeopardize EU relations, which are economically more important to the UK. Alternatively, appeasement could allow the UK to forge ahead in the tech-heavy economy of the future.</p>

The state has confirmed at least 607 measles cases so far this year, which is more than double the number of cases it saw in all of 2024. Health Secretary Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has delivered a tepid message on the importance of vaccination against measles, saying it should be encouraged while also sowing doubt in the vaccine's safety. Doctors are on high alert and urging people to get vaccinated.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman criticized President Trump's tariff policy, warning of an impending "economic nuclear winter." Ackman believes the tariffs are destroying confidence in the US as a trading partner, which will negatively impact consumers. He noted that business is a confidence game, and the president is losing the confidence of business leaders. He also criticized Commerce Secretary Lutnick for having a conflict of interest due to his firm's long fixed income position. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>A federal judge criticized the Trump administration for the "wholly lawless" deportation of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to a prison in El Salvador. The judge ordered the administration to bring him back to the United States, citing a lack of evidence supporting allegations that he was in the MS-13 gang. The Justice Department has asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to pause the ruling. The case has raised concerns about the administration's immigration policies and the treatment of detainees.</p>

          <p>As stock prices and stock futures fall rapidly, exchanges implement halts in trading to allow for market stability. These moves typically occur during periods of extreme market volatility, such as the current situation with surging global trade tensions. If S&P futures are down 7% during non-U.S. trading hours, trading is halted until traders willing to buy the contract at the "limit down" level emerge. These circuit breakers aim to prevent market crashes and allow for cooler heads to prevail.</p>

          <p>Asian shares experienced significant declines following a sell-off on Wall Street triggered by President Trump's tariff hikes and Beijing's retaliatory measures. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost nearly 8% shortly after the market opened, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped significantly. Market observers anticipate continued volatility due to the ongoing trade war. Some analysts remain hopeful that Trump will lower tariffs after negotiations, but others warn that earnings estimates and stock values do not fully reflect the potential impact of the trade war.</p>
