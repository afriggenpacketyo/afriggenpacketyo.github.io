          <h2>Study Suggests Male Childcare Subsidies Could Help Ease China's Demographic Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and highlighted the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, conflicting with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests. This decision follows clashes between demonstrators and federal agents executing immigration enforcement actions, leading to over 100 arrests. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Trump is federalizing part of California's National Guard, a move criticized by Governor Gavin Newsom as "purposefully inflammatory." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to deploy U.S. Marines if the violence continues, escalating tensions further.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a new registration system to encourage people to maintain strong connections with rural areas affected by depopulation. The initiative aims to sign up over 10 million users in the next decade, as part of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional areas. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, with the goal of facilitating the flow of city dwellers into rural areas. However, some officials express skepticism about the plan's effectiveness in fostering regional economic growth.</p>

          <p>According to sources, President Donald Trump reportedly called Elon Musk a "big-time drug addict" and expressed disapproval of a physical altercation between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

The Women's History Museum of Zambia is using social media to highlight the system's geometric patterns and symbols, which carry mathematical principles, references to the cosmos, and messages about nature. Originally taught and maintained by women, the project aims to push back against the colonial-era claim that African societies did not have their own knowledge systems. The initiative is part of a broader effort to reclaim cultural heritages and highlight the roles of women in pre-colonial communities.</p>
