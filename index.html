          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a close confidant, as his deputy, signaling a potential successor amid succession fears. This move comes as Palestinian leaders convened in the West Bank to address leadership transitions, but some view it as a cosmetic reshuffle amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Israeli military operations. Critics argue that the focus on internal politics underscores the PA's complacency, particularly as Palestinians face displacement and war, highlighting a disconnect between leadership priorities and the urgent needs of the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), signaling a potential successor. The move comes amid pressure from Western and Arab allies to reform the Palestinian Authority (PA) and expand its role in the governance of Gaza post-war. However, the appointment is unlikely to improve the image of Fatah among Palestinians, who view the party as out of touch and corrupt.</p>
