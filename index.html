          <p>ADP's latest report reveals a surprising downturn in the US labor market, with the private sector losing 33,000 jobs in June, starkly contrasting with the expected 100,000 gain. The report, which has a mixed record of predicting official government data, indicated that job losses were concentrated in service sectors like business services and healthcare, while goods-producing roles saw an increase. Small businesses with fewer than 20 employees were hit hardest, shedding 29,000 jobs, whereas large firms added positions. This data introduces uncertainty into the economic outlook as investors await the more heavily weighted government jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising home insurance premiums driven by an increase in extreme weather events, this article offers practical advice for homeowners to weather-proof their properties. Key recommendations include regular roof maintenance, installing storm shutters, and sealing gaps around windows and doors to prevent wind and water damage. Experts also advise clearing outside debris to reduce fire risk and cleaning gutters to prevent water backup and potential structural damage. Taking these proactive steps can reduce the likelihood of filing a claim, which may in turn help control rising insurance costs and, in some cases, qualify for discounts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani represents an existential threat to the city's Jewish community due to his political stances and rhetoric. The author criticizes Mamdani for refusing to condemn the phrase "Globalize the Intifada," supporting the BDS movement, and introducing a bill aimed at stripping some Jewish nonprofits of their tax-exempt status. The piece expresses deep concern that his potential mayoralty would empower antisemitic groups and make Jewish New Yorkers feel unsafe, especially in light of rising antisemitic hate crimes. The author calls on people of all backgrounds to protest Mamdani's candidacy.</p>

          <p>Homeowners' insurance premiums are on the rise across all 50 states, driven by an increase in severe weather events and natural disasters. According to data from Insurify, states like Louisiana and California are projected to see significant hikes of 28% and 21% respectively, far exceeding the national average increase of 8%. Experts explain that while rates are state-regulated, national insurance companies balance their risk portfolio, causing a ripple effect from disasters in one state to others. This trend is impacting the cost of living and the affordability of homeownership, with the increases expected to continue as climate events intensify.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has ruled that a contentious 1849 law does not constitute a ban on abortion, allowing the procedure to remain legal in the state. This decision resolves a legal ambiguity that arose after the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade. The court, with its 4-3 liberal majority, affirmed a lower court's finding that the 19th-century statute was intended as a feticide law, criminalizing attacks on a pregnant woman's unborn child without her consent, rather than a prohibition on consensual medical abortions. Consequently, abortions up to 20 weeks will continue to be legally available in Wisconsin.</p>

The strike, led by District Council 33 of AFSCME, has prompted the city to suspend residential trash collection and alter hours for public facilities. In response to the walkout, a judge has ordered essential personnel, including 237 emergency service dispatchers and some water department employees, to return to their posts, citing a threat to public health and safety. Mayor Cherelle Parker stated the city has made its best offer, while the union argues it falls short of their demands for significant wage increases.</p>

The legislation, a cornerstone of Trump's second-term agenda, includes increased spending for border security and defense, extends tax cuts, and makes significant reductions to healthcare and nutrition programs. House Republican leaders are pushing for a quick vote to meet a July 4 deadline, but face resistance from both Democrats and a faction of hardline conservatives who are displeased with changes made by the Senate.

In response, the band stated they were being targeted for speaking up and clarified they are against a "violent military machine," not any specific race or group of people.

          <p>As President Trump's major tax and spending bill returns to the House, its passage is threatened by deep divisions within the Republican party. A key point of contention for the conservative House Freedom Caucus is the bill's projected impact on the national deficit, which the CBO estimates at $3.3 trillion over ten years under the Senate's version. Another significant hurdle is the Senate's steeper cuts to Medicaid, which worries moderate Republicans from poorer districts who fear the political and social consequences. These internal conflicts create significant uncertainty as Speaker Mike Johnson attempts to unify his party for a final vote before the July 4 deadline.</p>

The nearly 140-year-old company is undertaking this court-supervised sale to restructure its finances and create a more sustainable business model for the future. Del Monte has secured $912.5 billion in financing from lenders to maintain operations during the process.

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will lay off about 9,000 employees, affecting less than 4% of its global workforce, as it begins its 2026 fiscal year. This move is part of ongoing organizational changes aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic market and follows several other rounds of cuts in 2025. The layoffs are reportedly intended to reduce layers of management between individual contributors and top executives. Despite the workforce reduction, Microsoft remains highly profitable, having reported nearly $26 billion in net income in the previous quarter, and joins other major software companies in slimming down its workforce this year.</p>

The decline comes as Tesla faces intense competition, particularly from Chinese EV makers, and a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite the drop in deliveries, the company's stock rose, with some investors believing this quarter may represent the bottom for Tesla's performance. The report noted that the popular Model 3 and Model Y cars constituted the vast majority of production and deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>

The move from the deteriorating J. Edgar Hoover Building, its home since 1975, was described by FBI Director Kash Patel as ushering the agency into a new era. This decision finalizes a long and politically charged process that had previously considered moving the headquarters to Maryland or Virginia. The new location, just blocks from the current one, is seen by the Bureau as the most cost-effective and efficient option for its mission.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, is expected to plead guilty in a deal that would spare him the death penalty. In exchange for pleading guilty to all charges, Kohberger would receive four consecutive life sentences and waive his right to appeal. The plea deal was initiated by Kohberger's attorneys and accepted by prosecutors, who informed the victims' families via a letter. The families have expressed mixed reactions to the news, with some feeling relief at avoiding a lengthy trial and others expressing anger. A judge must still approve the deal in court.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of an Israeli-backed 60-day ceasefire proposal for Gaza has yet to receive a formal commitment from either Israel or Hamas. While Israeli officials indicated strong government support for a framework, they stressed it is not a final agreement, and far-right cabinet members have voiced opposition to any deal that doesn't defeat Hamas. Meanwhile, the article highlights the deadly risks for Gazans seeking aid, with hundreds reportedly killed near distribution sites run by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF's director defended the organization's work in a tense interview, stating their goal is to provide food in a deadly war zone.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport is contemplating legal action against National Grid after an investigation revealed that a fire causing a major shutdown was due to a known, unfixed fault. The report found that National Grid was aware of a moisture problem at its North Hyde electrical substation since 2018 but repeatedly deferred maintenance, leading to the blaze on March 20. The incident caused thousands of flight cancellations and cost airlines an estimated Â£80-100 million. Heathrow asserts that National Grid should be held accountable for its failings, while the energy watchdog Ofgem has launched its own investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>A Persian-language X account, which satirically presents itself as Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, has publicly named Iran's new, officially undisclosed commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters. After Iran's semi-official media stated the commander's identity would be kept secret for his protection, the account launched a guessing game, later crowning an investigative journalist for correctly identifying the chief as Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi. Aliabadi is a veteran IRGC general known for his role in major construction projects.

Burke stated that while Ye had been visiting the country for a long time, his visa was canceled after the song's release because Australia does not need to "deliberately import bigotry." The minister clarified that the ban is not permanent, and any future visa applications would be reassessed, emphasizing that the decision was made to protect the community from hatred.</p>

It notes that the world's most vulnerable populations, particularly women and children, are hit hardest, with coping mechanisms growing increasingly desperate.

The author contends that the bill's deep cuts to the social safety net, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are ill-suited for a future with potential AI-driven job displacement. Furthermore, the legislation's rollback of clean energy credits for wind and solar will make it harder and more expensive to power the energy-intensive data centers required for AI development.

          <h2>USAID Officially Shuttered, with Operations Merged into State Department</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been officially closed after the Trump administration gradually dismantled the foreign aid body, merging its remaining functions into the State Department. The move, part of a push to align overseas spending with an "America First" approach, has drawn strong condemnation from former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, as well as humanitarian advocates. A recent study published in The Lancet medical journal warned that the aid cuts could lead to over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, a projection a State Department official called into question.</p>

          <h2>China's Honor Challenges Samsung with New Thin Foldable Smartphone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 08:01:24 EDT</div>

          <p>Chinese tech firm Honor has launched its new Magic V5 foldable smartphone, directly challenging market leader Samsung with a focus on a thin design and large battery capacity. The device, which measures as thin as 8.8 mm when folded, will initially be sold in China before a likely international release. The launch is strategically timed ahead of Samsung's own foldable phone event next week. While Honor has made significant strides in design and features, analysts note it still faces challenges in brand recognition and global distribution compared to the well-established Samsung, which benefits from its vertically integrated supply chain for displays and batteries.</p>

          <h2>Record Tick Activity Reported in US Northeast Amid Climate Change Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 08:00:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The northeastern United States is experiencing a record-breaking tick season, with data showing an increase in blacklegged ticks, the prevalence of Lyme disease, and emergency room visits for tick bites. Scientists and vector ecologists point to climate change as a likely factor, as warmer temperatures allow ticks to remain active longer and expand their geographical range. The Fordham Tick Index, which measures bite risk in the tri-state area, recently hit its highest level. While the trend is concerning, experts advise against panic, instead encouraging proactive measures like using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and performing thorough checks after being outdoors.</p>
