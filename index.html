          <p>In a case filled with twists, charges against Barry Morphew for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, have been dismissed without prejudice just before his trial was set to begin. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to finding Suzanne's body, as well as the exclusion of key expert witnesses, as reasons for the dismissal. Morphew's attorney maintains his innocence, stating that there is no physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The investigation continues as authorities search for Suzanne Morphew's body in a remote and mountainous region. The conclusion of this case remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit from the school arguing it was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda regarding antisemitism. President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with Harvard, stating the school has acted appropriately during negotiations and appears committed to doing what is right. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that enrolling foreign students is a privilege, not a right, and that the administration is committed to restoring common sense to the student visa system. This legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where about one in four students are from outside the United States.</p>

          <p>Recently unsealed court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who gave his wife a "bailout plan." Boelter's wife told investigators they were preparing for major incidents, and he instructed her to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin. Empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies were found in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans, who were seriously wounded in the attack, recounted being awakened by someone impersonating an officer before the shooting began, as the investigation continues.</p>

The analysis revealed that the "dragon man" was not a new species but an intact Denisovan specimen.

          <p>Dietitians are recommending chia seed pudding as a beneficial late-night snack for lowering cholesterol due to its high fiber content and low saturated fat. The soluble fiber in chia seeds can absorb cholesterol in the gut, removing it from the body. Made with almond milk, this snack contains minimal saturated fat, which is known to increase cholesterol production in the liver. The plant protein in chia seeds also contributes to heart health, making it a suitable option for those looking to manage their cholesterol levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted he might consider firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell, whom he appointed, for his monetary policy decisions. It remains unclear whether the president has the legal authority to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026. The president referred to Powell as a "Total and Complete Moron" and a "dumb guy," while the Fed has declined to comment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two recent videos have sparked public debate on social media in China about the erosion of moral values concerning respect for the elderly. The videos depict incidents where young people refused to give up courtesy seats on public transportation to elderly individuals, prompting criticism from nearby passengers. These incidents have reignited discussions about the importance of filial piety and traditional values in a fast-paced and increasingly individualistic society. The subway authority in Shanghai has offered little guidance on how to avoid such situations in the future.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests during a visit to Los Angeles. Vance also referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "Jose Padilla," a week after Padilla was forcibly removed from a news conference. Newsom's office responded by stating the comment was not an accident, while Vance's spokesperson claimed he must have mixed up two people who have broken the law. The vice president's visit and remarks underscore the political importance the Trump administration places on its hard-line immigration policies.</p>

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged him to revive diplomatic efforts with the U.S. regarding Iran's nuclear program. Araghchi stated Iran would only consider diplomacy once Israel's "aggression is stopped," insisting that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that Israel's attacks violate international law.

          <p>The United States' failure to reach a tariff deal with Japan and its threat to impose new duties on imports have strengthened China's negotiating position, according to analysts. China was significantly impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to raise duties on Chinese imports. These developments suggest that Washington is finding it challenging to achieve its objectives through trade talks this summer. Beijing's negotiators are expected to leverage this perceived weakness to adopt a firmer stance in future negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving anomalous radio waves detected from below the ice in Antarctica. The strange signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos, but these radio waves don't seem to be neutrinos. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, which should have absorbed the radio waves. The origin of the signals remains unclear, but researchers hope larger, more sensitive detectors may solve the mystery.</p>
