          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has publicly addressed Berkshire Hathaway's decision to sell its entire remaining stake, describing the move as a normal part of investing. BYD executives expressed gratitude for Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's 17 years of support, even as the company's stock fell over 6% following the news. This divestment from China contrasts with Berkshire's increasing investment in Japanese trading houses, with its stake in Mitsui now exceeding 10%. The article notes that BYD has recently faced challenges, including cutting its 2025 sales target and reporting its first quarterly profit decline in three years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 44 deaths across Gaza, according to health officials, escalating the humanitarian crisis. Despite increasing international pressure for a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed his commitment to continuing the war against Hamas in a defiant address to the United Nations. The ongoing conflict has severely impacted civilian infrastructure, with hospitals facing collapse due to supply shortages and direct targeting, forcing aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders to suspend operations. The violence persists as the region faces a worsening food crisis and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. The change comes after a poor start to the season left the club in 19th place in the Premier League table. Nuno, who was recently sacked by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to their highest league finish in decades last season, is tasked with improving the team's competitive standing. The appointment has been seen by some as a return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style, similar to that of former manager David Moyes.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating their policies "will tear this country apart" ahead of the Labour party conference. Starmer specifically targeted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, calling it one of the "most shocking things" the party has said. He positioned the Labour conference as an opportunity to present an alternative to what he described as Reform's politics of "toxic divide and decline." The comments come as Starmer faces internal pressure and trailing poll numbers against Nigel Farage's party.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has summoned hundreds of senior U.S. military leaders from around the world for an unusual meeting in Washington, D.C. The purpose of the gathering has not been made clear, raising questions and security concerns among observers due to the risk of having so many high-ranking officials in one location. The meeting coincides with the announcement of new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, which critics argue will reduce transparency and accountability.

          <p>Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve was ejected from a playoff game against the Phoenix Mercury after a heated confrontation with officials. Reeve's anger erupted in the final minute when her star player, Napheesa Collier, was injured during a play that resulted in a game-sealing layup for Phoenix. In a post-game press conference, Reeve bypassed questions and delivered a two-minute critique of the WNBA's officiating leadership, calling the assignment of the referee crew "f---ing malpractice." The incident highlights ongoing frustrations among coaches and players regarding the league's inconsistent officiating during a critical playoff series.</p>

          <p>A robust stock market is fueling consumer spending and supporting the U.S. economy, potentially staving off a recession despite concerns over jobs and inflation. Recent economic data shows surprisingly strong consumer spending and durable goods orders, largely driven by the "wealth effect" among higher-income individuals who own the majority of stocks. However, economists warn this creates a vulnerability; if the stock market, which has lofty valuations, were to decline, the economy could quickly enter a recession. While macroeconomic numbers suggest stability for now, declining consumer sentiment among non-stockholders indicates a fragile foundation for the current economic strength.

Despite these strategic moves, Clear Channel's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale is the best path forward for shareholders. The company is now seen as a more attractive acquisition target for peers like Lamar Advertising or private equity, given its focused operations and the slow pace of its valuable digital billboard conversion.

Similarly, the president's declaration that inflation has been "defeated" is inaccurate, as the Consumer Price Index rose by 2.9% in August, remaining above the Federal Reserve's target.

Trump, who has no medical training, baselessly connected the pain reliever's active ingredient, acetaminophen, to autism, a claim that has been widely refuted by medical experts. The author argues that this rhetoric dismisses women's pain, a well-documented issue in the medical establishment, and unfairly places blame on mothers for health outcomes. The column concludes that the administration's focus on Tylenol is not about health but is another attempt to control women's bodies and choices.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa through its government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. With branches in 49 African countries, these institutes offer language courses and scholarships, attracting students who see it as a path to economic opportunity. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in promoting the Chinese Communist Party's political ideology and interfering with academic freedom at host universities. Some analysts argue that this cultural expansion is linked to China's broader economic goals, including securing access to the continent's vast natural resources.</p>

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings over several military installations, including the Skrydstrup Air Base and the country's largest base in Karup. This latest incident follows a series of drone activities earlier in the week that temporarily shut down several Danish airports, prompting heightened security concerns across Northern Europe. The repeated and unexplained incursions have led officials to suspect a potential "hybrid attack," though no actor has been officially blamed. In response to the growing threat, Germany is considering new rules to allow its military to shoot down drones, and Sweden has offered to lend Denmark its anti-drone capabilities.</p>

Neurosurgeons at Holtz Children's Hospital in Miami successfully removed the tumor, and Imani subsequently endured 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year.

          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is developing and testing a new cockpit alert system called Surface Alert (SURF-A). The technology is designed to give pilots more advance warning of potential collisions on the ground, a critical phase of flight where seconds count. During a test flight, the system successfully alerted pilots to another aircraft on the runway, allowing them to safely abort a landing. While not yet required by regulators, safety experts and some airlines like Southwest and Alaska have embraced such systems to add another layer of protection and mitigate the risk of airport disasters.</p>

          <p>Broadcast media giants Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their ABC affiliate stations. The companies had pulled the program after host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a move encouraged by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. However, the boycott proved more costly for the local stations, which lost significant viewership by replacing the popular late-night show with local programming. The standoff highlighted the shifting power dynamics between networks and large affiliate owners, but ultimately demonstrated that the network's valuable content gives it the upper hand in such disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article revisits the landmark 1977 case involving a neo-Nazi group's plan to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The author reflects on the painful yet crucial First Amendment questions it raised about protecting offensive and hateful speech. The piece quotes David Goldberger, the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right to march, who acknowledged the pain it caused but stands by the principle that free speech cannot be denied simply because it is offensive. The author suggests this historical precedent offers a unifying thought for today's divided times: "Free speech doesn't work just when you agree with it."</p>

          <p>The recent federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey for making false statements to Congress could be vulnerable to legal challenges due to President Trump's long history of public attacks against him. Legal experts suggest Comey's defense may argue for dismissal on the grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution, citing the president's repeated calls for Comey's arrest. The case is further complicated by reports that career prosecutors initially opposed bringing charges and the recent appointment of a Trump loyalist with no prosecutorial experience to lead the U.S. Attorney's office handling the case. These factors could provide strong evidence of improper political motivation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to impose a $100,000 fee for all new H-1B visa applications, a dramatic increase from the current cost. The policy is intended to compel companies to hire American workers and to generate revenue for tax cuts or debt reduction. However, economist Britta Glennon of the Wharton School argues the move will harm the U.S. economy and its innovative capacity by deterring high-skilled foreign professionals. Research suggests that restricting skilled immigration often leads companies to offshore jobs rather than hire domestically, and that immigrants contribute significantly to innovation and entrepreneurship, ultimately creating more jobs for Americans.

The reviewer criticizes her for blaming her running mate, Tim Walz, for a poor debate performance and for indecisiveness in her campaign strategy. The analysis concludes that the memoir reveals shortcomings on policy, particularly regarding the border and inflation, and lacks the self-awareness needed to explain her defeat.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, allies and leaders within the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a rising charismatic Christian movement, have framed the event as a spiritual battle against demonic evil. At his memorial service, speakers like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the current political climate as a "spiritual war," using language that casts political opponents as enemies of God. This rhetoric reflects the NAR's belief that Christians are called to take dominion over all spheres of society. Before his death, Kirk had embraced these ideas, and his killing is now being used to mobilize followers for a cosmic fight against perceived evil forces.</p>

In many low- and middle-income countries, used car and backup power batteries are processed in informal, unregulated operations where acid is dumped and lead is melted down, releasing toxic dust into communities. This public health crisis, which drains trillions from the global economy, is solvable through policy changes.
