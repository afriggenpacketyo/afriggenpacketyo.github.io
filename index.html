          <p>The Detroit Opera is preparing to stage "The Central Park Five," an opera that chronicles the wrongful conviction of five Black and Latino teenagers in the 1989 sexual assault case. The opera depicts President Trump as an inflammatory figure who called for the teenagers' punishment, and its production comes at a time when Trump is a resurrected political force. Concerns have been raised about potential retaliation from the Trump administration due to the opera's critical portrayal of the president.</p>
