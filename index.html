          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. President Trump communicated the decision in letters to the respective leaders, stating that any retaliatory tariffs would be added to the 30% rate. This move is part of a broader strategy to establish a more "reciprocal" global trade landscape, following a previous nearly global 10% tariff. The announcement comes after a 90-day pause on many tariff hikes expired with few new trade deals finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" significantly reforms the federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans from seven to two. Beginning in 2026, new borrowers will choose between a standard 10-25 year plan or a new income-driven plan, while existing borrowers have until 2028 to switch. The law also eliminates Grad PLUS loans, sets new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and other loans, and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants. Additionally, it removes deferment options for economic hardship, aiming to simplify the system but raising concerns about longer repayment periods. (not investment advice)</p>

Services like Rizz and Keepler offer users suggestions for messages, help craft replies, and even provide ways to handle being "ghosted." These tools aim to boost confidence and help users stand out in the crowded online dating world. While some users find the AI helpful for initiating conversations, the trend raises questions about authenticity and the potential for over-reliance on technology instead of genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American, identified as Saif Musallet, was reportedly killed in the West Bank after being beaten by Israeli settlers. His family stated he was protecting their land and that paramedics were blocked from reaching him for hours, a claim which has prompted calls for a U.S. State Department investigation. The incident highlights rising violence in the region, which the UN considers to have illegal Israeli settlements. Simultaneously, Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have resulted in at least 28 Palestinian deaths, including women and children, as the conflict continues.</p>

The full context of her speech involved building the team for a new generation of fans, similar to how the team was built before Clark's arrival.

          <p>Unregulated mining for rare earth metals in Myanmar's Shan state is causing severe environmental pollution, affecting rivers that flow into neighboring Thailand. Residents and environmental groups report that the Kok and Sai rivers, which feed into the Mekong, are contaminated with hazardous metals like arsenic at dangerously high levels. This pollution has led to skin rashes and has rendered the water unsafe for bathing or irrigation. The mining boom is driven by global demand, particularly from China, and operates in a conflict-ridden area controlled by an armed ethnic militia, making regulation nearly impossible.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing new military funding for Ukraine, a potential shift in policy since he took office. According to diplomatic sources, this move could be a message to Russia following its recent escalation of drone and missile attacks. The administration has access to leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize Russian assets to fund such aid. This development comes amid Trump's mixed rhetoric, having previously criticized aid levels while also recently expressing disappointment with Vladimir Putin and suggesting more arms could be sent to Ukraine.</p>

The Trump administration has implemented cuts to the National Institutes of Health and ended funding for some mRNA projects.

          <p>This article argues that modern societal norms and parental fears are depriving children of the benefits of unstructured, "wild" free play. While animals spend their youth frolicking and exploring movement, children are increasingly sedentary, which can negatively impact bone health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Injury-prevention experts suggest that allowing kids to engage in activities like climbing trees and wrestling helps them develop robust "movement vocabularies," making them less prone to injury later in life. The author suggests that encouraging such play is crucial for developing resilient and physically competent individuals.</p>

          <p>Following a state policy granting highway patrol officers authority to detain drivers based on immigration status, many immigrants in Florida are living in fear. This has led to a set of unwritten rules for driving, such as avoiding Spanish-language music or stickers, not wearing work uniforms, and being selective about passengers to avoid being targeted. The fear of detention during routine traffic stops has disrupted daily life, with some workers too scared to drive to their jobs. Advocacy groups argue this approach normalizes border-style enforcement throughout the state and creates a climate of anxiety for immigrant communities.</p>

Biologist Bryan Watts has documented an alarming trend of osprey chicks starving in their nests, leading to a failure to fledge enough young to maintain the population. Watts and environmental groups blame the decline of menhaden, a small, nutrient-rich fish that is a critical food source for the birds and is also heavily fished for commercial purposes.

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, was rescued after being lost for 11 nights in the remote Western Australian outback. Police reported she became lost after her van got stuck in bushland, and she walked 24 kilometers in a disoriented state. She survived the ordeal by drinking water from puddles, eating minimal food supplies, and sleeping in a cave. Ms. Wilga was found by a passing driver suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and injuries, and was subsequently airlifted to a hospital in Perth, with police calling her rescue a matter of "sheer luck."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece condemns the so-called "Alligator Alcatraz," a tent-based immigrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades, as a performative display of cruelty. The author argues the facility, erected quickly and promoted by Florida officials, aligns with the Trump administration's anti-immigration agenda and its penchant for stylized domination. The article highlights reports of inhumane conditions at the camp, including a lack of sanitation, inedible food, and inadequate shelter, which have already led to one hospitalization. The commentary suggests that this stylized cruelty is designed to dehumanize immigrants and inflict real-world harm under the guise of political theater.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, former officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are warning that the agency is dangerously under-resourced. They claim a mass staff exodus, funding cuts under the Trump administration, and a loss of key leadership have eroded FEMA's ability to respond effectively, especially if multiple disasters occur simultaneously. Former chief of staff Michael Coen expressed concern that the agency lacks the resources it has had in past years. The criticism comes as the administration has signaled a desire to "phase out" the agency in its current form.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that President Trump's aggressive trade and tariff policies may pose political risks, even among his own supporters. The survey found that about one in four 2024 Trump voters believe his tariffs are hurting the U.S.'s ability to negotiate better trade deals. Furthermore, his voters are evenly split on whether he should have the unilateral power to impose them. While many support tariffs on China, a significant portion only do so if it does not lead to higher consumer prices, signaling a potential vulnerability for the administration's economic platform.

          <p>The Trump administration has once again delayed the implementation of steep tariffs on nearly 60 trading partners, pushing the new deadline from July 9 to August 1. This three-week extension is intended to provide more time to finalize framework agreements with partners like the European Union and India. While some foreign officials are skeptical that this is a hard deadline, others are taking it seriously, looking to appease the president to avoid global economic turmoil.

For example, majors like art history and nutritional sciences show lower unemployment than finance, while philosophy majors fare better than economics majors. This discrepancy highlights a growing trend of employers, such as BlackRock, seeking humanities graduates for their creative thinking and soft skills in an AI-driven world.</p>

While a black hole's gravity is so intense that it creates a "singularity" where known laws of physics break down, they do not function as cosmic vacuum cleaners. Researchers also have a term for what would happen if a person fell into one: the intense gravitational difference would stretch them out in a process called "spaghettification."</p>
