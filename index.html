          <p>President Trump has publicly stated that Elon Musk will face "serious consequences" if he supports Democratic candidates, escalating their ongoing feud. Trump claims he previously aided Musk's businesses during his first administration, but now believes Musk is being disrespectful. Trump indicated he has no intention of speaking with Musk and assumes their relationship is over. This follows Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies, particularly the "big, beautiful bill," and represents a significant break between the two former allies. Optimism about their relationship being repaired is low, given the strong statements made by both parties.</p>

He defended Trump's restraint and emphasized Musk's previous contributions as a special advisor, particularly in cutting government spending through the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). Vance also refuted Musk's claims about concealed information regarding Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Trump did nothing wrong with Epstein. Vance defended the budget bill, saying it was a good bill that extended tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, there's a growing focus on remembrance politics, with initiatives to recognize and symbolically heal historical injustices. Parliamentarians have adopted texts to reclassify historical events and offer reparations, including posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general and recognizing returnees from Indochina. The Assembly also addressed a "double debt" to Haiti, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations. Some experts view this willingness to take historical responsibility as social maturity, while others see symbolic initiatives as easier to pass than structural reforms.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sweeps in downtown Los Angeles on Friday sparked fierce protests and strong condemnation from elected officials, who described the actions as cruel and unnecessary. Demonstrators clashed with agents, leading to arrests and the use of less-lethal munitions by police. The raids targeted multiple locations, including businesses in the garment district, resulting in detentions and heightened tensions. Politicians have demanded investigations into the tactics used during the raids, while immigrant rights activists have decried the enforcement actions as creating terror in the community.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans are making a significant Social Security mistake by not saving adequately for retirement. He emphasizes that Social Security benefits typically replace only 40% of pre-retirement income, and the average monthly benefit is insufficient for a comfortable retirement. Ramsey recommends creating a savings benchmark of at least 15% of gross income, assuming an emergency fund is already established and debt is under control. He stresses the importance of securing financial stability for retirement years. (not investment advice)</p>
