          <p>Apple is moving the production of iPhones and other devices bound for the U.S. away from China, with India and Vietnam becoming major manufacturing hubs, according to CEO Tim Cook. This shift comes as the technology giant anticipates U.S. import taxes could increase its costs by approximately $900 million this quarter. While China will remain the primary origin for products sold outside the U.S., the transition to India and Vietnam involves significant investment and time. Apple is also planning to invest $500 billion across several U.S. states over the next four years, highlighting its commitment to the American economy.</p>

The decision demonstrates New Delhi's commitment to the "values and interests of the society and country." The article suggests the census is likely to lead to demands for increased quotas for certain castes in government jobs and education. The announcement comes ahead of a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a key issue, and follows similar caste surveys in other states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs. This move aims to protect U.S. manufacturers but is expected to raise prices for American consumers who shop online. The decision is partly motivated by concerns about fentanyl smuggling and the impact on U.S. jobs in warehousing and logistics. The changes apply to shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong, and are likely to cause confusion for consumers and small retailers.</p>
