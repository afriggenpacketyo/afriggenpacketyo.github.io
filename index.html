          <p>A Texas man was arrested after allegedly confessing to killing his wife and living with her decomposing body for a month. According to the Bexar County Sheriff, the suspect, Charles Byrd, made the disturbing comment to investigators that for his first offense, he wanted to "go big or go home." Byrd reportedly repeated his confession to a local news outlet, attributing his actions to a "mental break." He is currently charged with tampering with evidence, with murder charges pending the medical examiner's official report on the cause of death.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 bomber while on approach to Minot, North Dakota. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar, did not provide a warning about the military aircraft. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover at the North Dakota State Fair, an event which was captured on video by a spectator on the ground. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force are now investigating the near-collision to determine the cause of the communication failure.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have requested a federal judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody for 30 days. This unusual request is a strategic move to prevent him from being immediately transferred to DHS custody for deportation proceedings upon release. Abrego Garcia was previously deported in an admitted administrative error and was brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The legal maneuver aims to give his team time to address the imminent threat of removal while his separate criminal case in Tennessee proceeds.</p>

          <p>Actor Jason Isaacs, known for his role in the "Harry Potter" series, candidly admitted to spending nearly everything he earned, a habit financial experts identify as "lifestyle creep." His confession serves as a high-profile example of how individuals often increase their spending to match rising income, hindering long-term wealth accumulation. Financial planners cited in the article advise combating this tendency by automatically investing a portion of any pay raise before it enters a checking account. This strategy helps build wealth through compounding and avoids the financial fragility that affects many, even high earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A two-person nonprofit in Connecticut, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, is working to revitalize the Long Island Sound's ecosystem by returning used oyster shells to the water. The old shells provide an ideal surface for new oysters to grow, which in turn filter water, prevent erosion, and create habitats for hundreds of other species. The organization collects shells from over 50 local restaurants, cures them for a year to eliminate contaminants, and has already returned over 700,000 pounds of shells. This effort represents a positive environmental initiative aimed at reversing decades of overfishing and ecological degradation.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation is currently accelerating, causing days to become marginally shorter. This trend, driven by factors like the planet's liquid core, could force timekeepers to consider an unprecedented solution: subtracting a "negative leap second" from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep atomic clocks aligned with planetary time. Interestingly, this acceleration is being partially counteracted by the effects of climate change, as melting ice from Greenland and Antarctica is redistributing mass and slowing the planet's spin. The situation highlights a complex interplay of geological and atmospheric forces with significant implications for global timekeeping systems.</p>

Recent Supreme Court victories have emboldened the administration, which has launched a sustained rhetorical attack on federal judges, labeling them as politically motivated. This has coincided with a rise in threats against the judiciary. While the administration uses executive orders to rapidly advance its agenda, critics and some judges argue that this approach challenges the constitutional balance of powers, representing an unprecedented assault on the judicial system's authority and independence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declared it will intensify its immigration enforcement efforts by targeting sanctuary cities across the U.S. Following the shooting of an officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person, border czar Tom Homan announced a plan to "flood the zone" with ICE agents in these municipalities. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate, agents will make arrests in the community, detaining anyone found to be in the country illegally. The administration blames the policies of Democrat-run cities for creating unsafe conditions and providing sanctuary for criminals.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Governance Is Characterized by Pettiness Over Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated more by personal pettiness and vengeance than by any coherent policy ideology. The author cites multiple examples, including the renaming of military bases, barring former officials from government facilities, and a reported desire to fire the Fed Chairman for personal reasons. Even major foreign policy decisions, such as the approach to the war in Ukraine, are framed as emotional reactions to being slighted rather than strategic calculations. The piece concludes that this focus on grievance and culture-warring creates a volatile and unpredictable style of governance.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to expand its immigrant detention capacity by using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana, a move approved by the Department of Defense. According to official correspondence, ICE sought immediate access to Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey to hold up to 1,000 people at each site. The plan also includes increasing detention space at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This expansion is part of the Trump administration's broader push to arrest and detain more people who have entered the country illegally.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, highlighting him as a key figure in the reshaping of the federal courts under President Trump. Unlike the first term's reliance on the Federalist Society's list of conservative originalists, Bove's nomination represents a new phase focused on figures deeply aligned with the MAGA movement. His controversial background and proximity to the president signal a potential shift in the criteria for judicial appointments. The piece suggests Bove's confirmation process is a critical test for the future direction of the federal judiciary under a second Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust headline economic growth, many of its citizens are experiencing a starkly different reality of financial strain. The article highlights the story of an accountant in Chengdu who has not had a raise in five years and now faces the threat of being laid off, making home ownership an impossible dream. Experts note this growing disconnect between official data and the lived experiences of households and businesses, who are grappling with a weak job market and an uncertain future.

          <p>The federal judge assigned to Donald Trump's $10 billion libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and The Wall Street Journal is Darrin Gayles, the same judge who presided over Trump's prior lawsuit against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Trump voluntarily dropped the Cohen case after Judge Gayles scheduled a deposition for the then-president. The assignment raises the possibility that Trump will again face a deposition under oath, where he could be questioned about his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and the alleged birthday letter at the center of the lawsuit, forcing a similar decision on whether to proceed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the Trump administration's latest tax bill will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent but offsets only a fraction of the cost with $1.1 trillion in savings from stricter requirements for Medicaid and food stamps. These changes are estimated to leave an additional 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement while eliminating tax credits for renewable energy development. (not investment advice)</p>
