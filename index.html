          <p>A widespread and dangerous heatwave is impacting more than 185 million people across the U.S., from the Midwest to the East Coast. The Southeast is expected to face the most extreme conditions, with heat indices potentially reaching 120 degrees in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. This prolonged event is also accompanied by hazy skies in the Northeast due to Canadian wildfire smoke, offering little relief even at night. The article notes that Tampa, Florida, recently broke a 130-year heat record, underscoring the severity of the sweltering conditions.</p>

          <p>When asked about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's denial of a starvation crisis in Gaza, U.S. President Donald Trump responded, "I don't know," while acknowledging that television images show very hungry children. The comments came as Hamas-run health officials reported more deaths from malnutrition and Israeli airstrikes. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, present at the meeting, described the situation as a humanitarian "catastrophe." The article also notes that Israel has initiated daily military pauses in some areas to facilitate aid, though reports of deadly incidents near distribution sites continue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sahel region has transformed into a major hub for human and drug smuggling, exacerbated by recent military coups and shifting political alliances. After Niger's new military rulers, who have aligned with Russia, repealed a 2015 anti-smuggling law, the illicit trade, particularly in cocaine, has surged dramatically. This has empowered criminal networks, increased corruption, and is changing the dynamics with jihadist groups, leading to fears of rising "narco-terrorism." Experts warn that Europe is largely overlooking this growing crisis on its southern border, which poses a significant security threat.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United has started discussions with Southampton to sign England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, exploring either a loan or a permanent deal. Southampton, which was recently relegated from the Premier League, reportedly prefers a permanent sale for the player they acquired for an initial £18 million. The move comes after Newcastle's deal for another goalkeeper fell through and reflects their effort to strengthen their squad for the upcoming Champions League season. The potential transfer would reunite Ramsdale with his former manager, Eddie Howe.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dramatically shortened his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12 days. Citing a lack of progress and expressing disappointment over Russia's continued bombing of Ukrainian cities, Trump stated there is "no reason in waiting." The original ultimatum threatened secondary tariffs of up to 100% on countries trading with Russia if a deal was not reached. During a meeting in Scotland with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump indicated he was no longer interested in further talks with Putin.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact, a rare and exciting find according to curators. The print was found pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a model building placed in tombs, likely left by its creator before it dried between 2055 and 1650 B.C.E. While fingerprints have been found before, a full handprint of this clarity is highly unusual. The artifact will be a centerpiece in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, focusing on the craftspeople of ancient Egypt.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline approaching on October 1, divisions are emerging within the Republican party over how to proceed. Some conservative House members are suggesting a full-year continuing resolution (CR), which would freeze spending at current levels, an idea that mainstream and defense-focused Republicans oppose. A full-year CR is seen by some as a cut in real terms due to inflation, but others warn it would be detrimental to military funding. Given the tight legislative calendar and narrow GOP majorities in both chambers, a short-term CR appears likely to avoid a shutdown while negotiations continue.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by U.S. and Chinese researchers has identified livestock feces as a significant global reservoir for antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). The research, which spanned 14 years and 26 countries, analyzed the "livestock resistome" and developed a framework to map high-risk hotspots for these genes. These superbug genes can be transferred to humans through common bacteria like E. coli, posing a serious threat to public health. The study highlights the urgent need for global policies to monitor and manage antimicrobial resistance, which occurs when pathogens no longer respond to medicines.</p>

Currently, players receive just over 9% of league revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share in men's leagues like the NBA and NFL.

This change emboldens autocrats worldwide, who now face fewer consequences for abuses.

          <h2>Mark Cuban Shares Lessons from an Early Business Failure</h2>

          <p>Investor Mark Cuban recounted one of his earliest entrepreneurial ventures: a failed attempt to sell powdered milk at age 24 with less than $20 in capital. The business lasted only a month because, as he discovered, nobody wanted to buy his product despite his pitch that it would save them money. Cuban says the experience taught him a valuable lesson about failure: you only have to be right once to succeed. For aspiring entrepreneurs with no money, he advises focusing on sweat equity and providing a service based on a personal skill, such as tutoring or freelance design.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that while China's willingness to engage in a third round of trade talks is a "good sign," he does not anticipate an "enormous breakthrough." The negotiations are taking place in Sweden as a temporary pause on sweeping tariffs is set to expire. Greer downplayed expectations for a major resolution, framing the talks as a continuation of monitoring and checking in on prior agreements. His comments suggest that while dialogue is ongoing, the administration remains prepared to use tariffs as leverage if a satisfactory deal is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For those navigating the housing market, current mortgage rates remain a critical factor, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.79% as of July 25, 2025. The article explains that while rates are higher than in recent years, securing a good rate is still possible, especially for borrowers with strong credit scores in the mid-to-high 700s. To get the best terms, prospective buyers and refinancers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and shop around with multiple lenders. Shorter 15-year loans offer lower rates, averaging 6.01%, but come with higher monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a disabled writer details the profound challenges and indignities of finding safe, accessible housing in the U.S. and Canada. The author argues that the housing system perpetuates a history of exclusion, forcing many disabled individuals into unsafe or humiliating living situations where they cannot use basic facilities like their own bathroom. The article critiques the legal and practical barriers to modifying homes, from uncooperative landlords to historical preservation rules that prevent necessary updates. It concludes by urging a shift in perspective, where designing for accessibility is seen not as a burden but as a way to create inclusive communities for everyone as they age.</p>

He explained his strategic shift by stating that he sees greater potential returns in supporting the "picks and shovels" of the growing digital asset ecosystem, namely by investing in Bitcoin-related startups. Woo argues that while Bitcoin itself may have a 50x upside, a successful venture investment could yield 100x to 1000x gains. He believes the market has entered a new phase where investing in Bitcoin infrastructure is a more reliable way to outperform holding the asset directly. (not investment advice)</p>
