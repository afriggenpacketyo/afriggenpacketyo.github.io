        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are warning that Europe must undergo rapid reforms to avoid becoming a mere 'shock absorber' in the evolving global trade landscape dominated by the US and China. Despite a recent easing of tensions between the superpowers following talks in Geneva, the long-term outlook for Europe remains uncertain without deeper political integration and coordinated fiscal and industrial policies. Michael Pettis of Peking University suggests that without such changes, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others rather than shaping its own outcomes in global trade. The article emphasizes the need for Europe to proactively adapt to maintain its influence in the international arena.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost his appeal against a defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes. The original 2023 ruling stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true. Roberts-Smith argued the judge made legal errors, but a panel of Federal Court judges unanimously upheld the original judgement. The case, dubbed 'the trial of the century' in Australia, assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces for the first time in history. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and plans to appeal to the High Court of Australia.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of 7.6% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations. While revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, net income missed estimates due to factors like the disposal of subsidiaries and valuation changes in equity investments. Analysts had anticipated that investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce would drive stronger results, but the company is facing challenges from macroeconomic volatility and intense price competition in China. Alibaba is investing in 'instant commerce' and partnerships to boost user engagement, but it continues to navigate a complex economic landscape.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have officially gone on strike after failing to reach an agreement with the agency regarding pay raises, which they claim haven't been adjusted in five years. Despite ongoing talks, union representatives stated that NJ Transit walked away from the negotiation table, prompting the strike. Governor Phil Murphy expressed disappointment and urged both parties to return to negotiations to reach a fair and fiscally responsible deal. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan to accommodate a fraction of daily riders, advising commuters to work from home if possible, with cross-honoring of tickets on other transit systems.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit's engineers union initiated a strike at midnight, shutting down the rail network and impacting tens of thousands of commuters in the New York City metropolitan area. The strike, stemming from unsuccessful negotiations over fair pay, has led to picketing and significant disruptions.

The company reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen, further pressured by tariffs imposed by the US.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals a trend of lawyers strategically selecting federal jurisdictions to find judges sympathetic to their political views, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives often file cases challenging the Biden administration in small Texas courts, while liberals have increasingly turned to courts in Massachusetts to challenge the Trump administration. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to issue nationwide injunctions that dictate policy for the entire country. Critics argue this erodes confidence in the courts, while others defend it as a necessary tool for advocating for clients.</p>

Ventura maintained that despite appearing positive, her relationship with Combs became violent and controlling over time.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The GDP data was weaker than economists' expectations, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties stemming from US trade policies affected Japan's export-reliant economy. Despite these concerns, domestic demand showed a positive trend, and analysts anticipate a trade deal with the US to mitigate tariff impacts.

The number of dementia patients in China has risen significantly from 4 million in 1990 to 17 million in 2021, and this trend is expected to continue due to the country's rapidly aging population. The study, published in PLOS One, used data from the Global Burden of Disease database to analyze the incidence and risk factors of dementia. The researchers found that while dementia cases have doubled globally, they have tripled in China over the same period.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of a graduate who used his commencement speech to condemn the US for supporting what he termed a 'genocide' in Gaza. The university accused the student, Logan Rozos, of abusing the privilege of addressing his graduating class to express personal and one-sided political views. NYU is among several universities under scrutiny for incidents on campus related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. The Trump administration has been cracking down on what it calls antisemitism at elite institutions, stirring a debate about free speech.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees at Voice of America, a federally funded news network, signaling a continuation of efforts to dismantle the broadcaster. The layoffs, primarily targeting contractors and journalists, have sparked concerns about the administration's commitment to providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. The firings follow a court ruling that ordered the federal government to maintain robust news programming at the network, which President Trump has criticized.

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, facilitated by a land bridge that connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The study, published in Science, found that these migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges happening in both directions. The research highlights the interconnectedness of ancient ecosystems and the adaptability of animal populations.</p>

          <p>US Supreme Court justices have raised concerns regarding Donald Trump's efforts to circumvent the constitution and restrict birthright citizenship, in a series of immigration cases that could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The cases stem from an executive order that seeks to deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The court is also considering arguments about nationwide injunctions and whether they unfairly limit the president's authority, potentially leading to changes in how federal courts can address executive actions.</p>
