          <p>Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon issued a public warning after receiving threats on social media, stating they have been referred to the U.S. Marshals Service. The threats emerged after a staffer for California Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Chris Murphy appeared to link Dhillon to a suspicious fire at a South Carolina judge's home, a connection Dhillon described as outrageous and dangerous. The incident highlights the escalating political tensions and the real-world consequences of online rhetoric, prompting a sharp exchange between Dhillon and the governor's office.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Portland, Oregon. The ruling came after the administration attempted to mobilize troops from California and Texas, a move the judge suggested was a direct contravention of her previous order blocking the use of Oregon's own Guard. The legal battle underscores the escalating conflict between federal and state authorities over the response to ongoing protests in the city, with Oregon's governor insisting there is no need for military intervention.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that a looming mid-October payday for 1.3 million active-duty military members could be a critical catalyst for resolving the ongoing federal government shutdown. Missing this payment would carry a significant political cost, potentially forcing Congress and the White House to reach a compromise or pass a temporary funding bill. Goldman Sachs economists noted that if this deadline doesn't compel a resolution, the stalemate could become even more prolonged, as few other specific "forcing events" exist on the calendar to pressure lawmakers into action.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require at least 50% to 60% equity in their home. While the FHA does not set a specific percentage, this threshold is a common industry standard to ensure homeowners can cover ongoing costs like taxes and insurance. The actual amount that can be borrowed depends on factors such as the homeowner's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits, not just the equity percentage. Homeowners who fall short of the equity requirement may have options like paying down their existing mortgage or downsizing.</p>

          <p>A consortium led by American tech entrepreneur Brooklyn Earick has officially announced it will not make a formal takeover bid for the Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. The decision was confirmed in a statement to the London Stock Exchange after the club's owners had "unequivocally rejected" an initial expression of interest last month, insisting the club was not for sale. This marks the third informal approach the club has turned down since the departure of its long-serving executive chairman, Daniel Levy, in September.</p>

          <p>A Canadian CP-140 Aurora surveillance plane was repeatedly intercepted by Chinese fighter jets, one of which was armed with missiles, while conducting a UN-sanctioned mission over the East China Sea.

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to the city. The legal action follows the administration's plan to send hundreds of soldiers, which Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has labeled "Trump's invasion." State officials argue the deployment is a violation of federal law limiting domestic military use and an attempt to punish political opponents, while the White House insists the troops are needed to protect federal employees from what it calls "violent riots."</p>

          <p>After a slow fall season, the domestic box office is projected to rebound significantly this winter, potentially pushing the full-year earnings for 2025 above the post-pandemic high of $9.05 billion.

This optimistic forecast suggests a continued recovery for the theatrical industry, with projections for 2026 looking even stronger due to a slate of highly anticipated blockbusters.

The low bid comes despite the Trump administration's efforts to promote the coal industry, highlighting the economic challenges facing the sector as power plants continue to move away from the fuel.

This rapid implosion highlights President Emmanuel Macron's weakening grip on power and the increasing difficulty of forming a stable governing coalition as political factions begin positioning themselves for the 2027 presidential election.</p>

While this ensures continued insurance coverage, critics argue the extra step creates an unnecessary barrier that could decrease vaccine uptake and undermine public confidence, even as medical groups continue to recommend the shots for most people.</p>
