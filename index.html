          <p>Actress Barbara Stock, who played Liz Adams on the hit series "Dallas," shared her experience of discovering she was being written off the show without prior warning. She realized her time was up when a crew member mentioned it was her last day, a fact she should have guessed from a script that had her character packing a suitcase. Despite her initial heartbreak, Stock holds no resentment and has fond memories of the cast, including Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy. She later transitioned from acting to interior design to spend more time with her family.</p>

          <p>A powerful nor'easter is moving up the East Coast, prompting New Jersey to declare a state of emergency in anticipation of significant weather impacts. The storm is expected to bring major coastal flooding, high winds up to 60 mph, and heavy rainfall to the region, including New York City and Long Island. Authorities are warning of potential beach erosion and have activated emergency services to manage the situation. The storm system has also led to some flight delays and cancellations at major airports in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" amid the ongoing government shutdown, which has entered its twelfth day. He argued that Democratic leaders are refusing to fund the government unless their demands for extending health insurance tax credits are met, a position he claims is not a negotiation. Vance stated the administration is willing to discuss healthcare policy, but only after the government is reopened. The stalemate continues as over 4,000 federal workers have begun receiving layoff notices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy shared his concerns about the current state of the high court, describing some of its opinions as "a little bit too personal and confrontational."

He expressed worry that a lack of civility in public discourse is endangering democracy and hopes the court will "settle down" in its approach.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard Business Review study highlights the issue of "workslop," AI-generated content that appears useful but lacks real substance, which over 40% of U.S. employees report receiving. This phenomenon is said to be undermining productivity, but the article argues that employers, not just the technology, are to blame. It suggests that failures in AI implementation stem from a lack of proper training, clear policies, and strategic planning by companies. To be effective, AI requires investment in the people using it, rather than treating it as a magical solution.</p>

The article traces this plan back to the 1971 Powell Memo, which urged corporations to exert influence over news outlets to promote a more pro-business narrative and counter critical journalism. It argues that subsequent media deregulation and consolidation created an environment ripe for this kind of ideological takeover, representing a significant blow to the press's role as a check on power.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a warning to propaganda staff and classified units to tighten control over confidential information. The agency cited several recent instances of state secrets being leaked through media interviews and public-facing websites. An official article cautioned that news workers, in their pursuit of publicity, were sometimes neglecting confidentiality reviews, thereby endangering national security. The directive underscores the government's ongoing efforts to control the flow of information and manage its public narrative strictly.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Adviser Denies Role in Evidence Decisions for Collapsed China Spy Case</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no role in the evidence that led to the collapse of a spying case against two men accused of working for China. The charges were dropped last month after prosecutors said the government failed to provide necessary evidence, prompting criticism from the Conservative opposition. The Director of Public Prosecutions claimed the trial failed because the government would not provide evidence classifying China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng announced that the city will eliminate all limits on foreign investment in its manufacturing sector.

The mayor emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers would be treated equally in government procurement processes. The policy aims to integrate foreign companies more deeply into local supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the ethical conflict of being a Harry Potter fan while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination is valuable, despite their flaws. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the column suggests fans should actively and critically interrogate the text's problematic elements. This engagement, especially in a community, can transform a personal dilemma into a socially productive conversation.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister John Swinney claims that the precedent set in 2011, when the SNP's majority win led to the 2014 independence referendum, should apply again if his party secures a majority in the next Holyrood election. His strategy, backed by the party, frames the next election as a de-facto poll on independence. However, the UK Labour government, which would need to approve a new vote, has stated it does not support another referendum. Swinney contends that precedent gives his position a strong basis for negotiation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent Maga figures are supporting calls from El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, for the Trump administration to crack down on "corrupt judges" in the United States. This comes amid a rise in threats against the U.S. judiciary, which experts say is fueled by rhetoric from the administration and its allies. Bukele, who has dismissed judges in his own country, has repeatedly criticized the U.S. legal system. The article suggests this alignment reflects a broader authoritarian trend of undermining judicial independence as a check on executive power.</p>

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, Florida's Chief Financial Officer and a loyalist of Governor Ron DeSantis, is leading an initiative to audit Democratic-run cities and counties for what he calls "excessively wasteful" spending. This move is being criticized by local officials, such as those in Broward County, who argue the state's calculations are based on inaccurate data and ignore unfunded mandates imposed by the state itself. The initiative is seen by some as a politically motivated attack on DeSantis's opponents, aimed at bolstering a narrative that will support future tax reform efforts.</p>

          <p>Steven Gerrard has declined the opportunity to become the manager of the Scottish football club Rangers, marking the second time he has turned down the role. After flying to London for discussions, he reportedly decided the timing was not right, with a reluctance to work under the club's current sporting director structure cited as a key issue. The club's board is now left scrambling for a new head coach after their top choice rejected them. This leaves Rangers in a difficult position as they seek to replace their recently sacked manager, Philippe Clement.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's Taliban government announced on Sunday that its forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along their shared border. The assault was described as a response to repeated violations of Afghan territory by Pakistan, including alleged bombings earlier in the week. Pakistan has not confirmed the casualties but condemned what it called Afghan provocations, stating its army delivered a "befitting reply." The escalating tensions have led to the closure of key border crossings and drawn calls for restraint.</p>
