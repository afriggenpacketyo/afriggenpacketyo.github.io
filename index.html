          <p>Germany is planning a historic shift in security policy, aiming to transform its army into the strongest conventional force in Europe with a significant increase in defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of GDP. Other EU countries like France, Poland, and the UK are also bulking up their militaries, focusing on modernization and technological advancements. France, the EU's only nuclear power, is nearly doubling its defense spending, while Poland aims to have 500,000 troops. These rearmament programs reflect growing concerns about security threats and a desire for greater military autonomy among European nations.</p>

          <p>Sir Elton John has strongly criticized the UK government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws regarding the use of artists' content for AI development, calling the plans "theft" and labeling the government "absolute losers." He argues that this move would disproportionately harm young artists who lack the resources to fight big tech companies. The government spokesperson has said that no changes to copyright laws would be ‚Äúconsidered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators‚Äù. The House of Lords voted in favor of transparency requirements for AI companies, but MPs rejected this change.</p>

          <p>Wealthy shoppers continue to spend on high-end jewelry, driving growth in the luxury market, particularly for brands like Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati, and Cartier. While broader luxury spending is slowing down, the super-rich are becoming more selective, favoring only the most desirable brands. This trend benefits Richemont, the Swiss luxury group that owns these sought-after jewelry brands, as evidenced by their strong sales growth in the Jewellery Maisons division.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility conditions and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings, even for Chicago. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil into the air. Visibility dropped dramatically, affecting major highways and airport operations. The dry soil conditions in central Illinois, with moisture levels at record lows, contributed to the severity of the storm, reminiscent of dust storms during the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>Recent military clashes between India and Pakistan, sparked by a terrorist attack, have highlighted India's ongoing struggle to manage its troubled neighbor, hindering its aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power.

The conflict diverts India's resources and attention from its broader strategic goals, such as counterbalancing China. The situation is further complicated by religious nationalism and hardened views on both sides, making peaceful resolutions difficult.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated after Rwandan-backed rebels seized parts of the region. Most of the refugees were women and children, transported by buses and escorted by the UNHCR and Save the Children. The goal is to repatriate 2,000 people, who will receive assistance and support for reintegration. The returnees include individuals who were born in Congo and had never seen Rwanda, marking a significant moment in their lives.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reshaping decades of foreign policy in the Middle East by sidelining Israel and pursuing independent deals with countries like Syria and Iran. He shook hands with Syria's new leader and promised to lift sanctions, despite Israeli objections. This shift is evident in Trump's actions, such as announcing a cease-fire with Houthi militants in Yemen without consulting Israel and securing the release of an American hostage in Gaza independently. The change reflects a focus on economic interests and regional stability, even if it means diverging from Israeli priorities.</p>

          <p>Despite growing public regret over Brexit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to improve relations with the European Union face strong opposition from the British news media. Many outlets are critical of any moves toward closer ties, labeling them as a "surrender summit." This media hostility complicates Starmer's efforts, as he must navigate a landscape shaped by a vocal minority of voters and lawmakers who remain committed to Brexit. The situation is further complicated by the rise of right-wing populist party, Reform U.K.</p>

Lieutenant Kateryna, the only female combat pilot, highlights the challenges women face, including stereotypes and underutilization.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a stable fibre-optic gyroscope, potentially improving navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope can sense orientation and turning rates, crucial for inertial navigation systems that operate without external signals, offering immunity to interference. Traditional gyroscopes use moving mechanical components, but fibre-optic gyroscopes rely on the changing movement of light in optical fibres. Interferometric fibre-optic gyroscopes are already used in military and civilian applications, from aerospace to autonomous vehicles.</p>
