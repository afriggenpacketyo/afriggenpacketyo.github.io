          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named Atlantic storm, formed over the Caribbean and is predicted to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica by Saturday. Its center was located south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, moving west-northwest at 7 mph with 50 mph winds. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti's southwestern peninsula, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. The storm's trajectory beyond these initial impacts remains highly uncertain, with various models showing potential paths towards Cuba or Central America, though mainland U.S. impact is currently deemed unlikely.</p>

          <p>Anthony Boyd, a 53-year-old Alabama death row inmate, has requested a meeting with Governor Kay Ivey ahead of his scheduled execution by nitrogen gas for the 1993 murder of Gregory Huguley. Boyd, who maintains his innocence, asked the governor to stay his execution for a full investigation if she finds him credible during their conversation. Governor Ivey's office confirmed she reviews all execution cases but does not hold one-on-one meetings with inmates, citing no recent court filings disputing Boyd's guilt. Boyd's attorneys have unsuccessfully challenged the use of nitrogen hypoxia as a cruel and unconstitutional execution method.</p>

          <p>Plans for an in-person summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin in Hungary have been put on hold, causing anxiety in Moscow. Trump stated he didn't want a "wasted meeting" after Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated Moscow was not interested in an "immediate ceasefire" in Ukraine. The Kremlin, however, insisted that while dates were not set, preparations for a summit were still underway, dismissing "gossip and rumors." This suspension marks another shift in the U.S. administration's fluctuating stance on the Ukraine war, contrasting with Russia's earlier confidence after a "productive" phone call between the leaders.</p>

          <h2>Data Indicates Significant Decline in Young Adults Identifying as Transgender or Non-Binary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 07:00:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data suggests a sharp decline in the number of young adults identifying as transgender or non-binary, with identification among 18- to 22-year-olds cut nearly in half from 2022 to 2024. Professor Jean Twenge's analysis of nationally representative surveys, including the Household Pulse survey and the Cooperative Election Study, supports earlier findings by Eric Kaufman. Non-binary identification also dropped by over half between 2023 and 2024 for this age group. Theories for this shift include changes in societal acceptance or a decreased pressure for young people to rigidly define their identities, suggesting a "natural correction" in self-identification.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that consumers are experiencing "discount burnout" ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making price less of a priority in fashion purchasing decisions. A survey found that the importance assigned to price dropped 13% year-over-year, with shoppers now prioritizing consistent pricing, value for money, and quality. This shift is a "warning" for retailers, as traditional discount-driven strategies may be less effective, especially with rising prices due to tariffs. The luxury sector serves as a cautionary tale, where significant price hikes led consumers to trade down to premium brands, emphasizing the need for a focus on execution and brand strength.

This expansion aims to boost Eurostar's annual passenger numbers from 19.5 million to 30 million and support new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt.

Despite these withdrawals, Justice Secretary Mahmood insists the inquiry will not be "watered down" and will explicitly examine the ethnicity and religion of offenders.

Poczobut, a Polish-Belarusian correspondent, was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2023 for critical reporting against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Amaglobeli, a Georgian journalist, was jailed in August for two years on charges seen as retaliation for her investigations into public spending and abuse of office. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola praised their courage, recognizing them as symbols of the struggle for freedom and democracy.</p>

          <p>The grandchildren of Ruth Ellis, the last woman executed in Britain in 1955, are seeking a posthumous pardon, arguing she was a victim of domestic abuse by her partner, David Blakely, whom she killed. Ellis, a nightclub hostess, was convicted of murder after shooting Blakely following a tumultuous relationship that included physical abuse and a miscarriage. Her family contends that if her case occurred today, she would have a defense of diminished responsibility or loss of control, which were not legal defenses at the time. The application to the justice secretary aims to correct a historical injustice and acknowledge the impact of domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>At least 46 people were killed in a horrific multi-vehicle crash involving two buses and two other vehicles on a highway in western Uganda. The accident occurred shortly after midnight when two bus drivers, attempting to pass other vehicles in opposite directions, collided head-on, causing a chain reaction. Police initially reported 63 fatalities but later revised the count. This incident is one of Uganda's worst recent motor accidents, with police attributing frequent fatal crashes to speeding and careless overtaking. The Red Cross described gruesome scenes, highlighting the severity of the country's road safety issues.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris has reopened three days after a brazen daylight robbery where jewelry worth 88 million euros (£76m; $102m) was stolen from its Apollo Gallery. Thieves, using power tools, took less than eight minutes to break in and escape on scooters, though one damaged crown was dropped. The Apollo Gallery remains closed as investigators work to catch the criminals, believed to be part of a criminal organization. The heist, described by President Macron as an attack on national heritage, has prompted calls for expedited security measures, as a preliminary report found one in three rooms lacked CCTV.</p>

          <p>While the term "best friend" gained popularity in the 20th century, the concept of supreme friendships has ancient roots, offering significant psychological benefits beyond just having many friends. Research indicates that the quality of one's best friendships, characterized by deeper trust, disclosure, and shared reality, is a reliable predictor of individual well-being and resilience. Such connections are crucial for combating emotional loneliness, distinct from social alienation. Humans tend to subconsciously rank social connections, and investing emotional resources into a close inner circle of 3-5 "best friends" can lead to greater relationship satisfaction and overall happiness.</p>

          <p>The UK has seen a collective sigh of relief as inflation eased to 3.8% in September, falling below the feared 4% mark, though still above the Bank of England's 2% target. While consumers remain cautious, signs of stabilization are emerging, including easing food prices. Wage rises are now outpacing inflation for many, alleviating the cost-of-living squeeze. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hinted at potential energy bill relief in the upcoming November Budget, while economists foresee a growing chance of an interest rate cut in December. Businesses, however, warn that further tax rises could reignite inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gen Z is increasingly turning to TikTok for cultural commentary and news, but this reliance raises concerns about the quality and rigor of information consumed. The platform's bite-sized format often prioritizes speed and emotional certainty over nuanced analysis, leading to the spread of "bad takes" and potential misinformation. While some experts use TikTok effectively, the app's addictive algorithms and the "learning online" mindset from the pandemic have normalized consuming simplified, often speculative, content from non-experts. This trend highlights a generational shift in information consumption, where individuals seek knowledge from social media, despite its inherent limitations for deep intellectual engagement.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles cafes are experiencing a severe matcha shortage and rising prices, driven by surging global demand and production strains in Japan. Japanese tea farms face challenges from an aging population and hotter climate, leading to a 30% loss in spring harvest and tripled auction prices. This scarcity is exacerbated by U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports and cafes using larger quantities of matcha per drink. Suppliers are struggling to meet demand, with some resorting to rationing or securing annual contracts. The situation suggests matcha will become more limited and expensive, pushing businesses to adapt by raising prices or seeking higher-grade, less scarce alternatives.</p>

Proponents argue CEQA is outdated, slow, and costly, contributing to the state's affordability crisis. However, environmentalists and progressive lawmakers oppose the measure, asserting CEQA is crucial for protecting natural resources and vulnerable communities, and that previous exemptions have not solved housing issues.</p>

          <p>An undercover FBI agent successfully apprehended an alleged pedophile in Ventura by posing as both a father and his 12-year-old daughter on online messaging platforms. The suspect, Trevor Lyons, 41, is accused of engaging in sexually explicit conversations and requesting sexual acts from the "daughter," unaware he was communicating with the agent. Lyons was arrested and faces a nine-count felony indictment, including sexual exploitation and attempted enticement of a minor, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. This operation highlights law enforcement's proactive measures to combat online child exploitation and protect vulnerable youth.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Mental Exercise Can Reverse Age-Related Brain Chemical Decline</h2>

          <p>Scientists have found compelling evidence that cognitive training can boost acetylcholine levels in the brain, a chemical messenger that typically declines with age. A 10-week study of individuals 65 or older showed that 30 minutes of rigorous mental exercises daily increased acetylcholine by 2.3% in areas vital for attention and memory. This increase is significant, effectively turning back the clock on brain aging by about 10 years in this specific area. The findings support earlier animal research and suggest that scientifically tested cognitive training programs, like BrainHQ, can have a profound and notable effect on memory and thinking in older people.</p>
