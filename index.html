          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan sought by the Trump administration. This move broke the legislative quorum, prompting GOP leaders to threaten arrest and removal from office, with the state's attorney general suing to vacate their seats. The conflict has escalated, with Texas authorities withholding paychecks and seeking to enforce arrest warrants out of state. The Democrats remain defiant, arguing they are protecting voting rights against an unconstitutional power grab.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has welcomed Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state, vowing that California will counteract any Republican redistricting gains in Texas. Newsom announced plans for a potential ballot measure that would redraw California's own congressional map to favor Democrats, a move he described as a necessary response to protect fair elections. This positions California as a key player in the national battle over political gerrymandering ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The strategy is framed as "self-defense for our democracy" by supporters like Nancy Pelosi.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Montana have apprehended Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect accused of killing four people in a shooting at a bar in Anaconda. The capture followed an extensive weeklong manhunt in the mountains near the town. The motive for the shooting, described as an attack on patrons in cold blood, remains unclear, though family and community members have pointed to the suspect's history of mental illness and PTSD. The arrest brings a sense of resolution to the community, which was shaken by the violent rampage.</p>

          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents gathering daily at locations like a Pasadena Home Depot. The volunteers aim to document the activities of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and provide information and support to day laborers, who are often targets of immigration raids. This community-led initiative reflects a shift in protests against federal immigration policies from large downtown rallies to smaller, localized actions. The effort is intended to protect vulnerable community members and ensure transparency.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh expressed deep disappointment after learning that star offensive tackle Rashawn Slater will miss the entire season due to a ruptured patellar tendon. The injury, described as a "gut punch," forces a major reshuffle of the team's offensive line just before the season begins. Teammates and coaches are now focused on moving forward and honoring Slater through their performance on the field. The team is exploring free-agent options to address the sudden loss of depth on the line.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next Friday to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested that a potential peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories" to benefit both nations, a politically sensitive proposal for Ukraine. The announcement comes as a U.S.-imposed deadline for a ceasefire was set to expire and follows reports of U.S. and Russian officials working on a deal to freeze the conflict's front lines.

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has reported an increase in complaints about models appearing "unhealthily thin" in fashion advertisements, sparking concerns about a return of the "super skinny" trend. High-street brands like Zara, Next, and M&S have recently had ads banned for this reason, though the companies defended the health of their models. Experts and activists worry this aesthetic, reminiscent of the '90s "heroin chic" era, is harmful, especially when amplified by social media trends.

The directive aims to treat the cartels as a national security threat rather than just a law enforcement issue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has started issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a key market for the company. This move reverses a previous ban on the chip, which Nvidia had specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at limiting China's technological advancement. The restrictions were projected to significantly impact Nvidia's sales, and the new licenses could alleviate some of that financial pressure. The decision follows lobbying efforts by the company, including a meeting between CEO Jensen Huang and President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary, "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides an intimate look at the life of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist to explore his complex personality, creative influences, and internal conflicts with sudden fame. Using archival material and interviews with close friends and family, it paints a picture of an empathetic but evasive talent grappling with his father's legacy and his own ambitions. The documentary thoughtfully handles his accidental death, focusing on the rich but tragically short life he lived.</p>

          <p>This article explores the negative psychological effects of hook-up apps like Grindr, as told through the experiences of young gay men. Users describe an addictive cycle of seeking validation through casual sexual encounters that often leads to feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and depression. The app's environment is characterized as objectifying, where self-worth becomes tied to physical appearance, likening the experience to shopping for clothes online. While some enjoy casual encounters, others find it challenging to form meaningful connections in a culture that can feel overwhelmingly focused on sex.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to occupy Gaza City, a move largely opposed by the Israeli military and public but pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. This analysis suggests Netanyahu's decisions are primarily driven by his need to maintain the support of these hardline parties to avoid new elections, which polls indicate he would lose. These partners advocate for the ethnic cleansing and annexation of Gaza, a goal most Israelis reject. The plan creates a dangerous gap between the government's actions and the advice of its own security establishment.</p>

The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" as people on shore monitored them. After learning the truth, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, though he reiterated his stance on immigration.</p>
