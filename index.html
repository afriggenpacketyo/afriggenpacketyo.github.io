          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced it will make English the sole language for all its official business and services. This policy change aligns with a recent executive order from President Donald Trump designating English as the official language of the United States. While the agency previously accommodated over 200 languages, it will now operate exclusively in English, though it will still provide necessary accommodations required under laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act. The move reverses a previous policy from the Clinton administration that required federal agencies to offer language assistance.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, for allegedly creating and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." This network of malware-infected devices, including routers and DVRs, was reportedly used to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for paying customers since 2021. Prosecutors describe the botnet as one of the most sophisticated of its kind, capable of overwhelming websites and government networks in over 80 countries. Law enforcement dismantled the network after a search of Foltz's home, and he now faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly expanded its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to encompass 407 additional product categories, which took effect this week. The new levies now apply to a wide range of derivative products, including machinery, fire extinguishers, construction materials, and auto parts that contain these metals. The Commerce Department stated the expansion aims to close loopholes and support American industries, but the obscure customs codes used to identify the new items have made it difficult for the public to grasp the full scope. Experts estimate the tariffs now affect at least $320 billion worth of imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan man who has lived in Michigan for 16 years, has chosen to self-deport rather than risk being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Despite having no criminal record, he faces removal proceedings due to a 2014 ruling on a previous marriage, leaving him in legal limbo. Kangethe, a father to three U.S. citizen children, decided leaving was the "safest option" to avoid being separated from his family in a detention center. His story highlights the personal turmoil and difficult choices faced by individuals caught in the complexities of the U.S. immigration system.</p>

The home improvement retailer anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year, signaling stability to investors. While the company noted that homeowners still show a "deferral mindset" due to economic uncertainty, it also saw encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000. This performance suggests resilience in a challenging market, even as the broader real estate sector remains sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following electoral setbacks, some Democratic Party elites are exploring "abundance liberalism" as a new guiding philosophy to inspire voters. This ideology, popularized by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, advocates for streamlining bureaucracy to aggressively build more housing, clean energy infrastructure, and other public goods. The goal is to shift from a liberalism of regulation and constraint to one focused on tangible growth and development. However, the article notes that this vision faces significant political hurdles, particularly in suburban areas where policies promoting dense development can be unpopular with existing homeowners.</p>

          <p>Despite recent high-profile summits with Russian and European leaders, President Trump's efforts to broker peace in Ukraine confront major obstacles. While he has shown openness to providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv, tangible progress remains limited. The path forward is complicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's potential reluctance to negotiate while his forces are advancing on the battlefield. Furthermore, any U.S. commitments may face skepticism from Trump's "America First" political base, creating a delicate balancing act for a president aiming to secure a legacy-defining foreign policy achievement.</p>

          <p>A newly constructed veterinary hospital in Wilmington, North Carolina, was destroyed by an explosion on Tuesday morning.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's recent summits have raised hopes for ending the war in Ukraine, formidable obstacles remain, particularly from Russia's strategy. The author contends that Russia's ongoing, intense military assaults signal disrespect for diplomacy and that its concessions, such as agreeing to security guarantees, are a "poisoned chalice" designed to buy time. The piece warns that any peace deal must account for Ukrainian public opinion, which remains strongly against ceding territory. It concludes that for the peace process to succeed, Trump must back his diplomatic efforts with credible threats of further sanctions and military support.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, accusing them of politicizing intelligence and failing to safeguard classified information. The move, announced by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, targets many officials who have been critical of the president or were involved in assessments he has disputed, such as the one concerning Russian interference in the 2016 election. Critics have condemned the action as an unlawful act of retribution intended to suppress dissent within the government's intelligence community and punish public servants for their professional judgments.</p>

          <p>Walmart is recalling specific lots of its Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp following a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about potential radioactive contamination. The FDA detected the isotope Cesium-137 in a separate shipment from the same Indonesian supplier, PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, though that shipment did not enter the U.S. market. While the detected levels were below the FDA's threshold for acute health hazards, the agency noted that long-term exposure could elevate cancer risk. Walmart has removed the affected products from stores and is advising customers to dispose of them and seek a full refund.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal JAMA challenges the rationale given by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for restructuring a key CDC vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy had cited "persistent conflicts of interest" as the reason for the changes, but the research found that financial conflicts on the committee had been at historic lows for years. The study noted that the most concerning type of conflict—personal income from vaccine makers—had been virtually eliminated among members. This research adds a new dimension to the ongoing debate over the administration's changes to federal health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.</p>

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software company Palantir fell more than 9% on Tuesday, marking the fifth straight day of declines and a more than 15% drop from its recent all-time high. The slump follows a period of rapid growth, where the stock had more than doubled in 2025, driven by AI enthusiasm and significant government contracts. Despite a recent strong earnings report, the pullback coincides with a broader market downturn and reflects ongoing investor evaluation of the company's very high valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio has soared past 245, making it significantly more expensive than many other large technology firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ridership on Los Angeles Metro buses continued to decline in July, following a sharp plunge in June that coincided with federal immigration raids across the county. While rail ridership saw a slight recovery, the persistent dip in bus passengers has raised concerns that fear of being apprehended by ICE agents may be deterring people from using public transit. Metro officials also note that summer months typically see lower bus ridership due to school breaks, making it difficult to isolate a single cause. The trend poses a challenge for the agency, which has been struggling to rebuild passenger numbers to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
