          <p>The Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 114-109 in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, taking a 2-0 series lead. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a playoff career-high 39 points, supported by Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton. The Pacers capitalized on a strong fourth quarter, while the Knicks struggled with turnovers and defensive lapses. The article notes that no NBA team has ever lost the first two games at home and come back to win a series in the conference finals, putting the Knicks in a difficult position as the series shifts to Indiana.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across the country to alleviate overcrowding in hospital A&E departments. These centers will provide walk-in services and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists trained to handle acute mental distress. The NHS aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing wait times in A&E and speeding up access to mental health support. However, some experts express skepticism, calling for rigorous testing and better funding for NHS mental health services before national rollout.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has called for a trade agreement with the United States based on mutual respect, following threats from President Donald Trump to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized the EU's commitment to a deal that benefits both sides, while European governments warned that higher tariffs would harm both economies. Trump expressed impatience with the ongoing negotiations, stating his intention to raise tariffs on June 1 unless a major European investment is made in the U.S. The EU remains one of Washington's largest trading partners.</p>

          <p>Women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) face a difficult choice between managing their symptoms and conceiving a child, as contraception is the primary treatment but must be discontinued for pregnancy. Many women are scared to come off the pill due to the potential return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Experts emphasize the need for more research into PMDD to provide women with more treatment options beyond contraception. The Welsh government has announced a plan to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing limited humanitarian aid into Gaza after weeks of blockade, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies and distribution challenges. While COGAT reports a number of trucks have passed through the Kerem Shalom crossing, critics argue this is inadequate compared to the previous ceasefire when up to 600 trucks entered daily. Supplies are delayed by security clearances, logistical problems, and ongoing conflict, with aid organizations struggling to distribute food and essential items.

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, a departure from previous generations' dedication to employers. A study indicates that nearly half of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more personal time, disillusionment with corporate sacrifices, and changing attitudes influenced by the coronavirus pandemic. Experts see this trend as a positive step towards reducing overwork and improving overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Germany's reckoning with its Nazi past is often selective, embraced when it enhances the nation's self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an early SS supporter, exemplifies this contradiction. While Germany condemns the past, it struggles to confront societal entanglement with violence and genocide, as some of its wealthiest families built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor. The author argues that Germany's "never again" promise is being reduced to a slogan, observed only when convenient.</p>
