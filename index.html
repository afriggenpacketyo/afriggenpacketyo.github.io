          <p>Major UK airlines are demanding answers from the national air traffic control provider, NATS, following a significant system outage that grounded hundreds of flights. The radar-related issue, which took 20 minutes to resolve by switching to a backup, caused widespread cancellations and delays, affecting thousands of passengers during a peak travel period. This incident has drawn sharp criticism, with Ryanair calling for the NATS CEO to resign, especially as it echoes a similar major disruption that occurred in August 2023. The government is now working with NATS to understand the cause of the failure.</p>

Ukrainian officials described the event as a "horrible morning," noting that rescue operations are underway as people are still believed to be trapped under the rubble.

          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission has revealed that their record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a crucial docking mechanism for external experiments, became jammed during a cargo installation procedure outside the Tiangong space station. Lacking specialized tools for the unplanned event, the astronauts had to improvise a solution in real-time, collaborating closely with their ground control team. This successful ad-hoc repair highlights the crew's resourcefulness and problem-solving skills under pressure in a high-stakes environment.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in California, but the pilot managed to eject safely and was unharmed. The aircraft, which belonged to a Navy squadron responsible for training F-35 pilots, went down on Wednesday evening. The incident sparked a small grass fire that was quickly contained, and no other personnel were affected by the crash. Officials have confirmed the pilot's safety and have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the incident involving the advanced military aircraft.</p>

While deals have been reached with partners like the EU, UK, and South Korea, imposing new tariffs of 10-20%, many others, including allies like Canada and Mexico, face the prospect of much steeper levies. The administration's aggressive tariff strategy, aimed at reshaping global trade, has been met with retaliatory measures from nations like China and political resistance from others, creating a volatile economic environment for U.S. consumers and international partners.

With the series already secured, Blair Kinghorn is set to replace James Lowe on the wing, while James Ryan comes into the second-row for Ollie Chessum. The selection emphasizes cohesion, with eleven players having started all three Tests, and features a forward-heavy bench with a six-two split. The decision reflects a focus on finishing the tour strongly rather than providing opportunities for players who have not yet featured in the series.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean experienced a significant surge of over 16%, reaching their highest point since 2015. This market rally followed the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and South Korea, which sets a 15% tariff on Korean exports. The company is expected to benefit from the deal by expanding its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard, contributing to the revitalization of American shipbuilding. The stock's performance was also bolstered by strong second-quarter profits and recent announcements of new orders and global expansion initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts suggest India can afford this stance because its exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of its economy.

          <p>U.S. automaker Ford has increased its forecast for the financial impact of tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion this year. The company's finance chief attributed the higher-than-expected costs to prolonged tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as U.S. duties on imported steel and aluminum. Ford has already incurred an extra $800 million in duties in the second quarter alone. The announcement underscores the significant financial strain President Trump's trade policies are placing on major American corporations, even those with substantial domestic manufacturing operations.

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking ring, has stated conditions for her testimony before a House committee. In a letter from her attorney, Maxwell indicated she would only agree to a deposition if she is granted congressional immunity or a presidential pardon to avoid further criminal exposure. The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Maxwell as part of its investigation into the handling of the Epstein case. The committee has stated it will not consider granting immunity, and if her conditions are not met, Maxwell's attorney says she will invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip design company Arm Holdings fell by as much as 9% in after-hours trading following the release of its first-quarter earnings report. While the company's overall revenue and earnings per share met analyst expectations, its revenue from smartphone royalties, a core part of its business, was weaker than anticipated. The company is also signaling a strategic shift, confirming it is investing more heavily in developing its own chip components or even full solutions, a move that could turn current customers into competitors. This potential risk and the disappointing royalty figures have created uncertainty for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law in California that strengthens penalties for individuals who solicit 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense, a charge known as a "wobbler." The bill was controversial, with some Democrats initially raising concerns that it could be used to unfairly target certain communities. After a compromise was reached to add the age-gap stipulation, the bill moved forward and also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election. In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she remains committed to fighting for her values. The decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest that while she seriously considered the role, her heart wasn't in it, and this decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Horizon Biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, has resulted in the deaths of three people. The victims were an adult male employee and two young girls under the age of 12 who were waiting for him at the facility. The powerful blast tore apart the plant's main tower and shook nearby homes, with the resulting fire smoldering for nearly a day and hampering rescue efforts. Officials have now recovered the bodies and are investigating the cause of the tragic incident at the plant, which produces animal bedding and wood pellets.</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and its key allies, including the UK, France, and Canada, over the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As these allies announce plans to recognize a Palestinian state, the Trump administration has boycotted related UN conferences, viewing them as anti-Israel. This article suggests the U.S. lacks a coherent long-term plan for Gaza's governance beyond the removal of Hamas, leaving a strategic vacuum. In response, European and Arab nations are attempting to fill this void by reviving the two-state solution, driven by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, triggering tsunami warnings across the Pacific. While initial alerts were issued for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast, the risk has largely passed for the United States with only minor flooding and small waves reported. However, the event prompted new, high-level warnings and evacuations in South American countries like Chile and Colombia. The powerful quake caused flooding in Russia and appeared to trigger a volcanic eruption on the Kamchatka peninsula, highlighting the widespread effects of such a major seismic event.</p>

Baldwin had sued for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations, alleging he was targeted for political or professional gain. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice due to a lack of significant action, giving Baldwin's lawyers 30 days to refile. An attorney for Baldwin stated they have been in settlement talks and will refile if a favorable resolution is not reached, calling the dismissal a procedural "nonevent."</p>
