          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the event details significant security and communication breakdowns by the Secret Service during the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The report points to unfulfilled requests for resources and a lack of accountability for the failures that led to the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. It largely confirms previously known information but consolidates it into an official congressional finding, describing the situation as a preventable tragedy rooted in negligence.</p>

This blend of genetic science and traditional research has helped crack dozens of previously unsolvable cases, though it also raises complex questions about genetic privacy.</p>
