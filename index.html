          <p>A powerful line of thunderstorms is moving across the American Midwest, causing widespread power outages for over 170,000 customers and significant damage from high winds and a confirmed tornado. These storms are being fueled by a severe heat dome centered over the South, which has placed more than 165 million Americans under heat alerts from Nebraska to New Hampshire. While the heat is expected to gradually subside, the volatile atmospheric conditions are forecast to continue generating severe weather, including flash flooding and damaging winds, across the Midwest and Northeast in the coming days. Air quality has also deteriorated along the I-95 corridor due to pollution and Canadian wildfire smoke.</p>

          <p>The suspect in a Midtown Manhattan shooting that killed four people, including an off-duty police officer, was reportedly carrying a note claiming he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). According to police sources, the 27-year-old suspect, who has a documented mental health history, also made vague references to the NFL in the rambling, three-page note. The shooting took place in a building that houses the NFL's headquarters, and the suspect's note requested that his brain be studied for CTE, a degenerative disease linked to repeated head trauma. A definitive motive has not yet been established by law enforcement as the investigation continues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:17:42 EDT</div>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk dropped by 15% following an announcement that it was cutting its full-year sales and profit outlook. The company attributed the revised forecast to weaker-than-expected growth for its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, and its diabetes treatment, Ozempic, in the crucial U.S. market. According to the company's statement, the slowdown is due to persistent competition from compounded GLP-1 alternatives and a market that is not expanding as rapidly as previously anticipated. This news has raised concerns among investors about the future profitability of its flagship weight-loss treatments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading international authority, has issued an alert stating the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip." The report highlights that thresholds for extreme food lack and acute malnutrition have been met in most of the region, warning of widespread death without immediate, large-scale humanitarian intervention. This assessment comes after nearly 22 months of war and increasingly stringent blockades, which have caused essential services to collapse and left a third of the population going days without food. The IPC urges for an immediate end to hostilities to allow for unimpeded aid delivery.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia took effect this week after five days of deadly border clashes, brokered with the help of Malaysia and under pressure from the United States. While leaders expressed optimism, the truce was immediately tested by reports of violations, which Cambodia denied. Analysts suggest the conflict served political purposes for ruling families in both nations and that the ceasefire may hold, though concerns remain about the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism. The agreement was notably spurred by U.S. threats to delay trade talks and impose tariffs, adding an economic incentive for both countries to de-escalate the military confrontation.</p>

          <p>PayPal has reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance for transaction margin and earnings per share. The company saw a 7% rise in transaction margin dollars and a 12% increase in total payment volume for its Venmo service, its highest growth rate in three years. These results reflect CEO Alex Chriss's strategy to focus on more profitable revenue streams and better monetize key assets like Venmo. Despite the positive report and optimistic forecast, which implies a stronger fourth quarter, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

However, these protections will only apply when using mobile data, not when connected to a Wi-Fi network, which the company cannot control.

Kyle suggested that by opposing the law, Farage was siding with sexual offenders like the late Jimmy Savile, a remark Farage called "absolutely disgusting." The controversy stems from Reform UK's pledge to repeal the act, which they argue is ineffective and suppresses free speech, while the Labour government defends it as a crucial step in protecting children from harmful online content. The heated exchange highlights the deep political and ideological divisions surrounding internet regulation and free speech in the UK.</p>

At facilities for GE Appliances in Kentucky and Kraft-Heinz in Michigan, the termination of programs like the CHNV Parole Program has forced hundreds of experienced immigrant workers out of their jobs, creating production disruptions and forcing remaining employees to work extensive overtime. Economists warn that the administration's large-scale deportation goals could eliminate millions of jobs across sectors reliant on immigrant labor, including construction and hospitality.

Critics, including a former official, argue that dismantling this unit will have the opposite effect of the administration's stated goal to cut waste, leaving the $1.7 trillion federal student loan program vulnerable to abuse. The move comes as new legislation extends Pell Grants to short-term job-training courses, a sector historically prone to fraud, without the personnel to enforce regulations.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis in The Atlantic argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wartime decisions in Gaza have been compromised by his political dependence on far-right coalition partners. The article contends that Netanyahu's inconsistent policies on humanitarian aid—alternating between allowing and blockading supplies—were designed to appease extremists like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who advocate for displacing Palestinians. This dual-use strategy, aimed at both strategic military goals and advancing a far-right agenda, has undermined the war effort and led directly to the current hunger crisis.

          <h2>Analysis Warns Trump's Tariffs Could Lead to Higher U.S. Food Prices</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposed blanket tariffs, scheduled to take effect on August 1, could lead to higher prices for certain imported foods, according to a new analysis by the Tax Foundation. While the tariffs are intended to boost demand for American products, the U.S. does not produce some items, like Brazilian coffee, or has limited production of others, like bananas, to meet domestic demand. The analysis notes that U.S. consumers will likely bear the cost of these tariffs, which could exceed 30% for some countries. Key imports such as spirits, baked goods, coffee, fish, and beer are among those most likely to see price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The de Havilland Aircraft Museum in the UK has completed a meticulous restoration of a de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial passenger jetliner. The aircraft, which first flew with fare-paying passengers in 1952, ushered in a new era of speed and comfort but was quickly grounded after a series of catastrophic structural failures. The restored fuselage, now displayed in period Air France livery, recreates the luxurious interior of the 1950s, from its separate male and female bathrooms to its spacious seating. This exhibit offers a unique look at a pivotal, yet tragic, chapter in aviation history, showcasing the innovations and fatal flaws of the pioneering aircraft.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut $5.5 billion in federal funding for 1,246 medical research grants focused on LGBTQ+ health, a move critics say will leave science in the dark and worsen health disparities. The administration justified the cuts by calling the research "unscientific" and based on "amorphous equity objectives." However, public health experts argue that excluding LGBTQ+ populations from research on issues like cancer, Alzheimer's, and mental health will weaken evidence-based care for all Americans. This decision echoes historical exclusions in medical research that delayed critical health insights for women and Black Americans, with potentially devastating long-term consequences for public health.</p>

While the Perseids can typically produce 50 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak, far fewer will be visible this year.

Similarly, Germany's subsidy program for heat pumps faced backlash due to poor design and messaging.
