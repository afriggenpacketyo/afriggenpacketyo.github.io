House Republicans aim to cut $1.5 trillion in spending to offset tax cuts, but the CBO estimates spending cuts at $1.2 trillion and tax cuts at nearly $3.7 trillion.

          <p>South Korea's newly elected president, Lee Jae Myung, is likely to pursue stable ties with Japan, especially early in his term, navigating regional security challenges and uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. Despite Lee's past anti-Japan rhetoric, experts believe he will adopt a pragmatic approach, acknowledging Japan as an important partner. Japanese experts suggest that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba should quickly establish personal trust with Lee through summit talks to maintain trilateral cooperation with the United States. Lee's shift in stance is seen as an effort to present himself as a realistic politician amid turbulent times, considering public support for improved bilateral ties.</p>

The bomber, identified as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, died in the explosion, which also injured four others. Investigators indicate the device was more powerful than low-grade explosives, and Bartkus had access to chemicals that could be combined to create a homemade explosive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas for thousands of years before European colonization, caused by the bacteria species Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Researchers analyzed ancient remains in Canada and Argentina, reconstructing and dating bacterial genomes to find that the species spread rapidly across the Americas. Previously, it was believed that Europeans brought leprosy to the Americas via Mycobacterium leprae. The findings highlight the complex relationship between pathogens and humans throughout history, and may improve understanding of modern cases of leprosy.</p>

This practice, seemingly a rejection of feminine traits, underscores a shift towards impressing other men rather than attracting women. The emphasis on hypermasculinity and rejection of anything considered feminine is driven by misogynist influencers. Ironically, this pursuit of extreme beauty standards has led to body dysmorphia among young men, mirroring the struggles faced by young women.</p>

Kershaw acknowledges the need to improve his curveball to become a more effective pitcher, and he is determined to put together a complete game to help the team win; his last start saw the defense falter as well.</p>
