          <p>The families of 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, the two children killed in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, have released public statements. Fletcher's father described the attacker as a "coward" and remembered his son's love for family and sports, urging others to hug their children. Harper's family expressed their devastation and called for meaningful action to address gun violence and the nation's mental health crisis. Both families asked for privacy while grieving this senseless act of violence.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry analysts suggest that this Labor Day presents a significant opportunity for consumers to save money on electric vehicle leases. A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases and a $4,000 credit for used EVs are set to expire on September 30. With EV prices already declining, leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring these vehicles, accounting for 70% of transactions in July. Experts note that leasing is often a better option due to rapid technological advancements and faster depreciation compared to gasoline-powered cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), Colin Smyth, has had his parliamentary pass deactivated following reports that he placed a camera in a Holyrood toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour Party and charged with possessing indecent images of children earlier this month. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body took the action in light of the ongoing criminal investigation. In an email to staff, Holyrood's chief executive acknowledged the distressing nature of the allegations and reminded colleagues of available confidential support services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA). The decision states that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressional advisory panel, which President Trump has left mostly vacant. Judge Royce C. Lamberth found the attempt to terminate Abramowitz, and a prior effort to reassign him, to be unlawful. The ruling is a significant check on Lake's efforts to dismantle the federally funded international broadcaster, which has seen its operations drastically reduced under her leadership.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez after she refused to resign. Jim O'Neill, a deputy at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been named acting director. The move follows public disagreements between Monarez and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. Monarez's lawyers contend her termination was unlawful and that she was targeted for resisting "unscientific, reckless directives," highlighting a period of significant turmoil and leadership changes at the public health agency.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to expand the deployment of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to major cities across the state. The move is intended to support local law enforcement efforts in areas like Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Bay Area. Newsom touted existing crime numbers as being down but acknowledged that public perception is key. The announcement comes amid criticism from President Trump about crime in Democratic-led states, with Newsom contrasting his collaborative approach with local officials to Trump's threats of military intervention.</p>

          <p>The recent leadership crisis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine science and public health policy under the Trump administration. The firing of Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four other top officials followed a series of actions by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. These actions include gutting a key vaccine advisory panel and altering immunization guidelines. Resigning officials cited an inability to work in an environment that ignores scientific reality, raising fears that the turmoil could erode public trust and weaken the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled a Friday hearing for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit seeking to block President Trump's attempt to fire her. Cook is challenging the unprecedented move, arguing the president's justification—an unsubstantiated allegation of mortgage fraud—is "nakedly pretextual" and does not meet the legal standard of "for cause" removal. The lawsuit, which names Trump, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and the board as defendants, asserts the action is an attempt to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. The case is seen as a significant test of presidential power over the central bank.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump is within his constitutional rights to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whether "for cause" or not. The author asserts that Article II of the Constitution vests all "executive power," including the removal of officers, in the president. The piece contends that the modern administrative state, with its "independent" agencies, is in tension with the founders' vision. It concludes that members of the Fed's Board of Governors exercise executive power and therefore must be subject to presidential removal to maintain political accountability.</p>

The recall affects 2015-2018 Ford Edge and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX SUVs. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, which may lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances. Ford will notify owners of the safety risk in early September, but a remedy for the issue is still under development and is not expected to be available until April.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve are concerning, the larger threat to its independence comes from Congress's fiscal policy. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where a central bank's monetary policy becomes subordinate to the government's need to finance its debt. With U.S. debt exceeding 100% of GDP and interest payments rising, the pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates low will persist regardless of who is president. The article concludes that without meaningful budgetary reform from Congress, the Fed's ability to fight inflation will be compromised. (not investment advice)</p>
