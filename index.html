This change comes as the sector faces economic headwinds and hopes that a fresh, more visible aesthetic will reignite brand desirability and appeal to a broader market.</p>

This event marked NASA's first Pacific splashdown in half a century, concluding a 146-day mission that covered over 63 million miles in orbit.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon market, which enjoyed a renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown due to a combination of factors. Changing consumer habits, particularly among younger generations drinking less, along with post-pandemic inflation have weakened sales. The situation is further exacerbated by global trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs, leading to an oversupply of bourbon and financial distress for some distilleries, including recent bankruptcies.

          <p>A public feud within the Kapur family, founders of auto components giant Sona Comstar, is spotlighting a persistent challenge for India's corporate landscape: succession planning. With approximately 90% of listed companies in India being family-controlled, many lack formal plans for leadership transition, often leading to bitter and public disputes that can harm shareholder value. Experts note that while some families are now adopting more structured approaches, the absence of clear governance often results in conflict upon the patriarch's death.</p>

          <p>Despite a new coach and a rebuilt squad, Rangers FC is exhibiting familiar patterns of inconsistency, a problem that has plagued the team under previous managers. After a strong win in a Champions League qualifier, the team was booed by fans following a disappointing draw in a domestic league match. Manager Russell Martin acknowledged the team's lethargy and stated that changing the club's underlying culture is 'no quick fix,' as the pressure to challenge for the title mounts early in the season.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from financially supporting Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The lawmakers fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial redistricting plan. The lawsuit, filed by the state's Attorney General, alleges the PAC engaged in bribery by covering travel and lodging, while O'Rourke has countersued, accusing officials of trying to silence dissent and dismantle his voter registration efforts.</p>

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time is testing the recently improving, yet fragile, relationship between Tokyo and Beijing. While Japan does not formally recognize Taiwan, the official's presence is part of Taiwan's broader effort to increase its international visibility. Observers believe that while Beijing will view the move negatively, both China and Japan are likely to handle the situation carefully to avoid undermining their delicate diplomatic progress.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals as soon as they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences would be deported right away and barred from re-entering the UK, with their destination country deciding if they serve any remaining time. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, though critics question whether other countries will agree to accept the deported individuals.</p>
