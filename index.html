          <p>Shohei Ohtani initiated the game with his 13th home run, while Yoshinobu Yamamoto secured his fifth victory of the season as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied to defeat the Athletics 9-3. Ohtani's impressive shot to right field in the first inning set the tone, and Yamamoto pitched effectively for six innings, allowing three runs and striking out six. The Dodgers' offense exploded in the later innings, highlighted by Miguel Rojas' RBI double and a five-run eighth inning, securing the win and boosting Yamamoto's record. Seiya Suzuki also contributed with his 11th home run for the Chicago Cubs in a loss to the Miami Marlins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two British academics discovered that a seemingly ordinary manuscript in Harvard Law School's library is actually an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, one of only seven such documents in existence. The manuscript, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, had been misclassified as a copy for decades, but careful analysis revealed its authenticity. The discovery is especially significant given the document's historical importance in establishing fundamental liberties and limiting the power of rulers. This rediscovery comes at a time when Harvard faces scrutiny, highlighting the enduring relevance of Magna Carta's principles.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-expected growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7% according to official figures. This figure surpassed analysts' forecasts of 0.6%, indicating a positive start to the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. The economy also grew by 0.2% in March, exceeding predictions of zero growth, signaling continued momentum in the UK's economic recovery.</p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved a bill providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the legislation is necessary to support law enforcement, while Democrats express concerns that it could embolden misconduct and disproportionately affect Black individuals. The bill allows for an immunity hearing where a judge determines if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside their duties. The bill now goes to Alabama's Governor, who has indicated she will sign it into law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely driven by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not anticipated to be a major contributing factor. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) notes that Denmark's economy grew 3.7% in 2024, and is expected to weaken to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026 due to anticipated weakness in export growth. However, the IMF suggests that Denmark is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs because most Danish drug products are neither produced nor pass through the country.</p>

          <p>What was previously believed to be a copy of the Magna Carta held at Harvard Law School has been confirmed as a rare original dating back to 1300. British experts based their conclusion on the document's size and handwriting, consistent with those in the six previously known originals. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, is a foundational document establishing the principle that rulers are subject to the law. The discovery comes as Harvard University faces pressure from the Trump administration, adding significance to the document's message of fundamental rights.</p>

This heightened activity marks the fourth consecutive day of similar reports, contributing to a five-day total of 161 sorties detected near the island.

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has issued a decree tightening immigration policies, drawing comparisons to the Trump administration's approach in the United States. The decree imposes stricter requirements for citizenship and permanent residency, and facilitates the deportation of migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes. Additionally, it mandates that foreigners pay for public health care and education, a significant shift from Argentina's tradition of openness to immigrants. Critics worry the new rules will challenge the country's history of welcoming migrants and providing access to basic services.</p>

          <p>The UK Defense Ministry attributes the massive explosions at Russia's 51st GRAU arsenal to poor weapons handling and negligent storage practices. The explosions, which occurred in late April, are estimated to be Russia's largest loss of its own munitions due to its troops' actions since the start of the war in Ukraine. Satellite images revealed extensive damage to the depot, suggesting significant losses of strategic supplies. This incident is consistent with a pattern of Russian ineptitude regarding munition safety, according to the UK Defense Ministry.</p>

The plan involves releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months, in addition to 321,000 tons already auctioned. This measure aims to stabilize rice prices, which have been rising due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased demand from restaurants catering to foreign tourists.

          <p>Police are conducting door-to-door DNA testing in East London in an effort to identify the parents of three newborn babies abandoned in similar circumstances between 2017 and 2024. The babies, named Harry, Roman, and Elsa, were all found shortly after birth in the Newham area. Detectives are focusing on approximately 400 nearby houses and contacting individuals in the national DNA database who may share familial DNA with the children's mother. Police believe the mother may be unable to come forward due to restraint or mental health issues, and are concerned about the well-being of any future children.</p>

          <p>After four days of escalating airstrikes and drone attacks, India and Pakistan have agreed to a fragile cease-fire, averting a potential nuclear conflict. The crisis was triggered by alleged terrorist attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to retaliatory strikes that reached deeper into Pakistani territory than in previous conflicts. The Trump administration intervened to de-escalate the situation, warning against further escalation. This event highlights the dangers of the modern nuclear age and the urgent need for diplomacy between the two nuclear-armed nations to prevent future miscalculations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average cost of private school education in the UK has increased by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government predictions, following the implementation of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decline in private school enrollment due to the increased costs. The average termly fee for a day school now stands at Â£7,382, including 20% VAT, compared to Â£6,021 last year. While some schools have reduced fees (excluding VAT) to mitigate the impact, the ISC argues that the government underestimated the overall effect of VAT and other financial changes.</p>
