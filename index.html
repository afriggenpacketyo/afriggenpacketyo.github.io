          <p>U.S. pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced the permanent closure of all its stores, marking the end of its decades-long business operations. This decision comes after the company filed for bankruptcy multiple times, most recently in May, citing efforts to significantly reduce debt and resolve ongoing opioid-related lawsuits. Over 520 Rite Aid pharmacies had already ceased operations since October 2023, representing a substantial portion of its footprint. The company's website now serves primarily to assist former customers with pharmacy record transfers and finding new providers, reflecting a complete exit from the retail market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland. President Trump had stated his intention to send troops to address "domestic terrorists," but Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the president's determination was "untethered to the facts." The judge cited constitutional concerns regarding the federal government's relationship with states and the military's role in domestic law enforcement. This decision supports Oregon's lawsuit arguing against the federalization of the National Guard without state consent, reaffirming local control and challenging the executive's authority.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza "in the coming days," after Hamas agreed to certain aspects of President Trump's peace plan. Netanyahu confirmed sending a delegation to Egypt to finalize technical details, aiming to conclude negotiations within a few days. While Hamas accepted the hostage-for-prisoner exchange, it sought further negotiation on other deal portions, like weapons decommissioning. Trump also urged Israel to cease hostilities to ensure safe hostage retrieval, with Israel preparing to implement the initial phase of the proposal, signaling a complex path toward potential resolution.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, citing concerns over out-of-control crime and protests. This move follows a shooting incident where federal agents reportedly shot an armed woman after vehicles rammed law enforcement cars. State and local leaders, including Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, have criticized the deployment as an abuse of power and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." The Chicago deployment mirrors similar controversial actions in other Democratic-led cities, intensifying federal-state tensions over law enforcement authority and raising questions about executive overreach.</p>

          <p>Liv Heeney, from Birmingham, discovered at age 28 that she carries a faulty gene likely to cause early onset frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a condition that claimed her mother's life at 54 and affected 13 other family members. Living with the expectation of developing FTD in her 40s, Liv is now proactively planning for her future, including using IVF and embryo screening to ensure any future children do not inherit the gene. Her decision to undergo genetic testing provides her with the opportunity to prepare and make informed choices, despite the profound emotional challenge.</p>

          <p>Global equity markets are reaching record highs despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, highlighting a disconnect between political instability and investor sentiment. Fund flows indicate significant movement into global equities, particularly the technology sector, yet experts warn of increasing concerns about market bubbles, especially in credit markets. The article also notes the burgeoning economic phenomenon of "Swiftonomics," referring to the substantial financial impact of pop star Taylor Swift's latest album and record-breaking tour. This complex environment, marked by both growth and caution, suggests a need for diversified investment strategies to mitigate potential instability in the global financial landscape.</p>

          <p>Fiji is experiencing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with cases soaring elevenfold in five years, reaching nearly 6,000 by 2024. The crisis is largely attributed to a spiraling trend of intravenous drug use, unsafe sexual practices, and "bluetoothing"—a dangerous method of sharing blood among drug users for a cheaper high. The country's health minister declared an outbreak, with projections of over 3,000 new cases by 2025. Challenges include a drastic shortage of needle-syringe programs and widespread lack of education, prompting calls for a well-coordinated national response to reverse the alarming trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before-and-after images dramatically illustrate the rapid retreat of glaciers globally, with Switzerland's Rhône Glacier shrinking significantly since 1990. In 2024, glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica lost an estimated 450 billion tonnes of ice, a rate considered "massive" by glaciologists. This accelerated melting, particularly evident in the Alps, is directly linked to human-induced global warming and carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists warn that much of the future melt is "locked in" due to climate lag, but limiting global warming to 1.5C could preserve half of the remaining ice, highlighting the urgency of decarbonization efforts.</p>

Psychologists explain this phenomenon through the "anticipation of reward" and the release of dopamine, enhanced by the exclusivity of the product or event.

          <p>Syria is set to hold its first parliamentary elections since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad ten months ago, though not in all provinces, raising concerns about inclusivity. The People's Assembly will not be directly elected; instead, "electoral colleges" will select two-thirds of representatives, with Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa appointing the rest. Elections have been postponed in three provinces due to security reasons and sectarian violence, further complicating the democratic process.

Immunologists explain that late nights, poor diet, stress, and lack of sleep during freshers' week significantly weaken the immune system, making students highly susceptible. Stress, in particular, releases cortisol, suppressing immune responses, while alcohol consumption reduces white blood cell production.

          <h2>Chevron Refinery Fire Highlights Safety Concerns and Impact of Government Shutdown on Investigations</h2>

          <p>A significant explosion and fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery unnerved South Bay communities, reigniting concerns about industrial safety and environmental violations. The incident, which injured at least one worker and caused widespread alarm, underscores a history of safety breaches at the facility. Environmental advocates lament that the ongoing federal government shutdown will likely prevent thorough investigations by agencies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board. This lack of federal oversight, coupled with proposed budget cuts, raises fears that the root causes may remain unknown, hindering future accident prevention.</p>

          <p>An FBI agent has reportedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in a "perp walk" of former FBI Director James Comey, deeming the plan inappropriate. Comey was indicted on federal charges days after President Trump called for aggressive investigations into political adversaries. FBI leadership allegedly discussed using "large, beefy" agents in Kevlar vests to escort Comey to his arraignment, a public display common in high-profile cases. Comey, who denies charges of lying to Congress and obstructing proceedings, is set to appear in court, highlighting ongoing political tensions and concerns over the weaponization of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown has forced numerous National Park Service (NPS) sites to halt operations, reduce staffing, or rely on external donations, causing widespread confusion for visitors. While some park roads and trails remain accessible, essential services like trash collection, restrooms, and road maintenance are severely limited or absent. Concerns about vandalism and safety have prompted calls from park advocates to close all understaffed parks, citing irreparable harm seen during previous shutdowns, such as tree cutting and illegal road digging at Joshua Tree National Park. States are stepping in with funds, but the situation highlights the vulnerability of national treasures during political impasses.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of extra police officers have been deployed across Manchester to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack, which killed two Jewish men and injured three others. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed officers are working extended shifts and receiving support from other forces, with planning also factoring in the Conservative Party Conference. While police question the appropriateness of a pro-Palestine march held concurrently, they aim to minimize disruption. Four individuals remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses related to the attack, which involved Jihad Al-Shamie, who was shot dead by police.</p>

          <p>Two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed, and three others seriously injured, in a car ramming and stabbing attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. The suspect, 35-year-old British citizen Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police after attempting to force entry into the synagogue. Police confirmed one victim, Mr. Daulby, was fatally hit by police gunfire while helping secure the doors. Al-Shamie, who was on police bail for an alleged sexual assault, is believed to have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology. The attack, now a terror incident, has prompted widespread condemnation and calls for increased security.</p>

          <p>Nearly 500 people were arrested in central London during a protest supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action, despite pleas from ministers and police to postpone demonstrations after a synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers, Defend Our Juries, stated approximately 1,000 participated, with arrests for supporting a proscribed organization ranging from ages 18 to 89. The Metropolitan Police noted the time-consuming process of arrests as many protesters had to be carried out. Amnesty International UK criticized the arrests as a breach of human rights obligations, while Jewish community leaders called the protest "phenomenally tone deaf" given recent events.</p>

          <p>Hearts fans are increasingly optimistic about a potential Scottish Premiership title challenge after their team's unbeaten start to the season, now five points clear at the top. Despite head coach Derek McInnes cautioning against premature title talk, a 91st-minute derby winner ignited euphoric celebrations at Tynecastle. The club's early success, backed by a £10m investment, makes a challenge for second place seem more realistic, especially with rivals Rangers in turmoil and Celtic yet to hit top gear. While some recall Aberdeen's previous collapse after a strong start, fans are encouraged to enjoy the moment and embrace the burgeoning optimism surrounding their team's impressive performance.</p>

          <p>The annual Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach proceeded without U.S. military aircraft due to the federal government shutdown, disappointing thousands of attendees. The U.S. military is typically a major draw for the three-day event, known for its advanced aerobatics and displays of military might. While British Royal Air Force and Canadian Armed Forces acted as substitutes, many veterans and enthusiasts expressed sadness over the absence of American fleets. The incident highlights how political impasses can impact public events and national pride, even as the patriotic spirit on the ground remained strong amidst the international aerial displays.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Premier League title defense is faltering, with the reigning champions suffering consecutive late-goal defeats, dropping them from the top of the table. Arne Slot's side lost 2-1 to Chelsea and 1-0 to Crystal Palace, both conceding crucial goals in injury time, marking Slot's first three-game losing streak. This contrasts sharply with their early season form, where late goals often secured wins, indicating an unsustainable high-risk strategy. Pundits suggest Liverpool looks unbalanced after significant new signings, leaving them vulnerable to counter-attacks. The international break offers a chance for the team to regroup and address their recent struggles.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has pledged to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years if they win the next election, unveiling a stringent new borders plan. The proposals include banning asylum claims from those entering without permission and replacing judicial appeals with Home Office official reviews. A reformed "Removals Force" would see its funding doubled to £1.6bn annually, tasked with removing 150,000 individuals each year, a five-fold increase from current figures. The plan also involves expanding migrant detention facilities and restricting asylum grounds, drawing inspiration from US policies, and potentially leading to the UK's exit from the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
