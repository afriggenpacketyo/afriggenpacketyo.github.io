          <p>The United States is conducting a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increased security risks. Non-essential staff and their families are being removed as a precautionary measure. This decision follows stalled talks regarding Iran's nuclear program and heightened tensions in the region, with President Trump expressing diminished confidence in Iran halting uranium enrichment. The evacuation reflects ongoing assessments of personnel posture at embassies in potentially dangerous areas, with the US prioritizing the safety of its personnel amidst regional instability. The decision to evacuate staff from the Middle East highlights the volatile security situation in the region. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

          <p>All twelve members of the Fulbright scholarship board have resigned in protest, alleging that the Trump administration interfered with the selection of award recipients. The board members claim the administration denied awards to numerous individuals already selected and subjected 1,200 approved foreign recipients to an unauthorized review process. They argue that these actions undermine the program's merit-based selection and political independence, contradicting the Fulbright mission and values. The State Department dismissed the board members as partisan political appointees and defended the administration's right to ensure alignment with its executive orders. The resignations highlight concerns about political influence on academic and cultural exchange programs. The optimism score for this article is 35.</p>
