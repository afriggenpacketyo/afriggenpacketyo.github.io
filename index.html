          <p>President Trump convened his national security team for the second time in two days to discuss potential responses to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, including the possibility of a U.S. military strike. The administration is also preparing for the evacuation of American citizens from Israel. Trump stated he had not yet decided on a course of action, while Iran threatened "irreparable damage" if the U.S. intervened militarily against its nuclear facilities. Israel initiated the conflict with a preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear program and military sites, prompting retaliatory missile fire from Iran. </p>

          <p>AstroAI has issued a recall for approximately 249,100 mini-fridges due to the risk of fire and burns caused by a potential short circuit in the electrical switch. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reported at least 70 incidents involving the mini-fridges emitting smoke, burning, melting, or catching fire, with two fires resulting in over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are advised to immediately cease using the recalled mini-fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement product. The recalled models were sold online between June 2019 and June 2022. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in JAMA reveals a correlation between addiction to social media, mobile phones, and video games among teenagers and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The longitudinal study, which followed over 4,000 children from ages 9 to 14, found that a significant portion of the participants developed increasing addiction to these digital platforms. Teens with high or increasing addiction levels reported suicidal thoughts and behaviors two to three times more often than those with low addiction. The study highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing screen addiction in adolescents, rather than solely focusing on screen time, to mitigate mental health risks. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report projects that Social Security trust funds will be depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously anticipated, potentially leading to a 19% reduction in benefits. This acceleration is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act. While benefits won't disappear entirely, beneficiaries could see a decrease in their monthly checks, with the average retiree's benefit potentially dropping from $1,976 to around $1,600. Lawmakers are urged to take swift action to address the program's financial challenges, considering options such as raising revenue or adjusting benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a preliminary hearing, federal authorities testified that Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado Molotov cocktail attack, allegedly used Israeli flags to identify and target victims he considered Zionists. Investigators found the number "1187," the year Jerusalem was liberated by Muslims, on clothing and items in Soliman's car. Soliman faces multiple charges, including attempted first-degree murder and hate crimes, in connection to the attack that injured 12 people. The defense argued that Soliman's definition of Zionism hinges on political views, questioning whether the hate crime statute applies. </p>
