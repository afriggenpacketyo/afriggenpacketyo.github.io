        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study has identified key genetic differences in how depression manifests between sexes, potentially explaining why women are diagnosed almost twice as often as men. Researchers at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute found nearly double the number of genetic variations linked to depression in women compared to men. The findings also show a stronger overlap between depression-related genes and metabolic traits in women, which may correlate with symptoms like weight changes. This research highlights the importance of considering sex-specific biology in mental health studies and future treatment development.</p>

          <p>The trial of Maja T., a German national accused of attacking suspected right-wing extremists in Budapest, is proceeding amid doubts about its fairness and Hungary's commitment to the rule of law. Germany's Constitutional Court had previously raised concerns about the humane conditions of detention in Hungary before the extradition. The case has been highly politicized, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban labeling the anti-fascist movement Antifa a terrorist organization. Meanwhile, co-accused Ilaria Salis, now a Member of the European Parliament, has had her immunity upheld, highlighting a stark contrast in legal outcomes.</p>

          <p>In a television interview, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans of boycotting negotiations to end the ongoing government shutdown. He argued their primary goal is to finance tax cuts for the wealthy by allowing healthcare premiums to rise significantly for many Americans. Murphy stated that Democrats are reasonably requesting that any budget deal not devastate middle-class families to benefit billionaires. He dismissed the idea of trusting the current administration to negotiate on healthcare after reopening the government, framing the situation as an emergency requiring immediate action to protect citizens' finances.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" over their demands to extend health insurance tax credits as a condition for ending the government shutdown. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Vance asserted that the administration will not negotiate on healthcare policy until the government is reopened. He argued that Republican leaders are prepared to discuss the issue but refuse to reward what they see as a political maneuver by the opposition. The stalemate continues as both parties trade blame, with thousands of federal workers facing layoffs and financial uncertainty.</p>

A specialized army unit known as CAPSAT has announced it has taken leadership of the military command, the same unit that was instrumental in Rajoelina's own rise to power in 2009. The unrest follows weeks of youth-led protests against utility shortages, which have broadened into widespread dissatisfaction with the government.

          <p>Several women are sharing their distressing experiences with Meta's advertising algorithms, which continued to show them baby-related content after they suffered miscarriages or stillbirths. These targeted ads, intended for expectant mothers, became painful reminders of their loss, severely impacting their mental health. While Meta allows users to adjust ad preferences, some women report that blocking parenting-related topics is ineffective. The issue has sparked a wider debate about the emotional insensitivity of automated ad systems and whether tech companies bear a responsibility to prevent such psychologically harmful experiences for their users.</p>

While the agency has legal authority to operate within 100 miles of any U.S. boundary, including coastlines, this expanded domestic role has led to concerns about constitutional violations and a lack of accountability for agent conduct.</p>

          <p>At 33, Brooke Cooper has been named the general manager of the Worcester Red Sox, making her the first woman to hold such a position in the history of the Boston Red Sox franchise. Her journey began with a rejection for an internship with the team, but she successfully reapplied two years later and steadily climbed the ranks from merchandising to marketing. Cooper's promotion is a significant milestone, as only 14 of the 120 Minor League Baseball teams were led by female general managers in the 2025 season, highlighting a gradual shift in a traditionally male-dominated field.</p>

          <p>The Chinese commerce ministry has issued a stern warning that it will take resolute measures if the United States proceeds with a threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The threat, made by President Trump, also includes new controls on critical software and has already caused significant turmoil in financial markets, with Wall Street values dropping sharply. While China defended its own recent export controls on rare-earth materials as legitimate, it stated a desire to avoid a trade war but affirmed it is not afraid to engage in one to protect its interests.

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is causing significant financial hardship for federal workers like Stephanie Rogers, a microbiologist with the FDA and single mother of two. Having learned from the 2018 shutdown, Rogers took preemptive steps such as moving in with her mother and withdrawing from her retirement funds to weather the lack of a paycheck. The current situation feels more precarious due to threats of denied backpay and mass firings, creating immense stress and uncertainty for her family. Her story illustrates the profound personal impact of the political stalemate on hundreds of thousands of public servants.</p>

          <p>During a rare press conference in Delhi attended by female journalists, the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was questioned about his regime's severe restrictions on women's rights in Afghanistan. Muttaqi claimed the ban on girls' education was not forbidden by Islamic law but had been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader. Afghanistan remains the only country where women are barred from high school and university education, among other public activities. The press conference followed an outcry after women journalists were initially excluded from a Taliban media event a few days prior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary article posits that the appointment of conservative provocateur Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is the culmination of a 50-year conservative strategy to reshape American media. The piece traces this effort back to the 1971 Powell memo, which called on corporations to challenge and influence news outlets to be more favorable to the enterprise system. The article argues that decades of media deregulation, corporate consolidation, and pressure campaigns have eroded accountability journalism. This has paved the way for figures like Weiss to lead major news divisions, framing a political project as objective journalism.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a public warning to staff in propaganda departments and other classified units to prevent media leaks. Citing several past instances where state secrets were disclosed by news outlets, the agency emphasized the need for stricter confidentiality reviews. The warning noted that public information outlets are closely scrutinized by foreign entities and that some media workers, in their pursuit of novelty, have endangered national security by prioritizing publicity over secrecy. This directive highlights the government's ongoing efforts to tighten control over information flow.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that President Trump is "looking at all his options" regarding the potential use of the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement. While Vance noted the president has not yet felt it necessary, the comments come amid White House efforts to deploy federalized National Guard troops to cities like Chicago and Portland, moves that have been blocked by courts. Critics view these actions as a political overreach, while the administration argues it is exploring all avenues to ensure public safety in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK's education secretary has stated that Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's national security adviser, had no role in the substance or evidence of the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped after prosecutors claimed the government failed to provide necessary evidence designating China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives have suggested Powell was behind the decision not to disclose the information, prompting calls for his resignation and an urgent explanation from ministers in Parliament.</p>
