          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national attending the University of Michigan, fled the U.S. after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus but later missed court hearings and boarded a flight to Shanghai using a Chinese passport. Despite a judge's order to surrender his passport, Gao's actions led to a federal charge of flight to avoid prosecution. The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China, making his return unlikely.

Russia acknowledged the attacks, stating that several aircraft caught fire and that some suspects had been arrested. Ukraine estimates the damage at $7 billion, though other experts give a lower estimate of $2 billion.

Universities UK found institutions are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws.

          <h2>Call to Stop Displaced Children Going 'Missing' from Schools</h2>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures preventing children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs. The charity's report calls for a notification system to alert authorities when a child moves into temporary accommodation. Currently, over 164,000 homeless children live in temporary accommodation across England, leading to families being displaced and children's education suffering. The government states it is investing Â£1 billion in homelessness services this year to aid families trapped in temporary housing. The lack of stability significantly impacts children's access to education and healthcare.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing scrutiny over a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation. The law, which is yet to be implemented, aims to increase black ownership of land, but has drawn criticism from US President Donald Trump and local political parties. The government insists compensation will be paid in most cases, and that the law is needed to address historical imbalances. Legal experts clarify that expropriation without compensation would occur only in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The article explains the nuances of the law and the reactions it has provoked.</p>

Despite enlisting in 1952 and serving for 18 years, Williams says he was not given a say in his discharge date. He believes about 400 men were similarly affected.
