The Smithsonian also addressed concerns about biased content, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content and report progress to the board. Trump had signed an executive order placing Vance in charge of supervising efforts to "remove improper ideology" from the Smithsonian.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations have erupted in Los Angeles in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to clashes between protesters and police. Tensions escalated after President Trump deployed the National Guard over objections from state and city leaders. The protests began following federal agents executing search warrants at businesses suspected of unlawfully employing undocumented immigrants. Demonstrators are calling for an end to ICE raids, with solidarity protests spreading to other cities.</p>

          <p>The protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement operations are analyzed as a potential mass movement against the Trump administration. Despite concerns that protests may lead to violence or give Trump an excuse to overreach, the article argues that large demonstrations can be effective. The author emphasizes that Trump's turn to the military indicates his weak public sway and that peaceful protests can influence policy and public opinion. Historical examples, such as the reversal of the family-separation policy, are cited to illustrate the impact of public opposition.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to unveil her spending review, outlining funding allocations for public services like the NHS, schools, and police over the next few years. The chancellor will emphasize plans to invest in Britain's renewal by spending an extra Â£113bn on infrastructure projects. Some government departments are likely to face real-terms cuts, as the chancellor prioritizes health and defense budgets. The review will cover day-to-day spending for the next three years and investment budgets for the next four, extending up to the next general election.</p>

          <p>President Trump has warned that "any" protesters at the military parade in Washington will be "met with heavy force." This statement follows Trump's decision to send troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. The parade, honoring the Army's 250th anniversary, coincides with Trump's birthday. The comments raise concerns about potential restrictions on freedom of assembly and the use of force against demonstrators.</p>
