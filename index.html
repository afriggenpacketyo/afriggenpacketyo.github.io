          <p>Following an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Los Angeles that led to numerous arrests, large and tense protests have erupted throughout the city, particularly in areas like the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A.. ICE confirmed the execution of search warrants related to harboring undocumented individuals, leading to the arrest of Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West President David Huerta, who was later charged with obstructing federal agents. Leaders across Los Angeles, including Mayor Karen Bass, have criticized the federal government's tactics, while federal officials have defended their actions and warned against interference. The Los Angeles Police Chief and L.A. County Sheriff have stated they will not cooperate with federal authorities in deportation efforts, amidst ongoing tensions and planned continued operations. The optimism score for this event is low, reflecting the social and political tensions surrounding immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offensive struggles continued as they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in a 2-1 walk-off defeat, marking their second loss in less than 24 hours.

Nolan Gorman's ground-rule double in the ninth initiated the winning rally for the Cardinals, while the Dodgers' lone run came from Shohei Ohtani scoring on a passed ball. The team also placed starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin on the injured list due to elbow discomfort, further complicating their pitching situation. </p>

Kenyan economist James Shikwati suggests that the Tanzanian government's actions stem from a fear of protests amid economic uncertainty. The incident has sparked fear among Kenyans about traveling to Tanzania and has led to concerns about the future of the East African Community. Despite support from neighboring countries, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan faces strong domestic headwinds. </p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through Rome to call for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, in a protest organized by Italy's main opposition parties. Protesters criticized the right-wing government for its perceived silence on the conflict and demanded a clear position on the situation in Gaza. The march attracted a diverse crowd, including many families with children, who expressed their opposition to the massacre of Palestinians and the actions of the Israeli government.

Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior.

To mitigate these risks, cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, replacing the habit with healthier alternatives like exercise, and eating undistracted. </p>

Many of the dogs were mother dogs with young nursing puppies, and the shelter is providing medical care for various health issues, including skin and dental problems.
