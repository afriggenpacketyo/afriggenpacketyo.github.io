          <p>Tesla has denied recent reports that the company's board has initiated a search for a replacement for CEO Elon Musk. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm stated that the reports were false and that the board is confident in Musk's leadership and his ability to execute the company's growth plans. Musk himself criticized the Wall Street Journal, which originally published the report, accusing them of unethical journalism for publishing a deliberately false article and failing to include Tesla's denial. The article also notes that Musk stated he would be allocating more of his time to Tesla.</p>

          <p>Emma Brockes argues that Britain's attempts to appease Donald Trump have been futile, as the UK is likely to be placed behind South Korea and Japan in trade talks. She suggests that belligerence has been more effective for other negotiators dealing with Trump. The article draws parallels with Columbia University's experience, where concessions to Trump did not result in the restoration of federal funding. The author questions how many times Britain will continue to seek Trump's favor, suggesting that the UK's sense of exceptionalism leads it to believe it can negotiate its way out of any situation.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is seen as an effort to improve relations with the EU amid uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs.

While the EU welcomes the move, it maintains its own sanctions related to Xinjiang and has no plans to revive a frozen investment deal with China.

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths. Donald Trump has stated that this deal will provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine’s defense and its reconstruction after he brokers a peace deal with Russia. The deal will establish a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund. The final terms were far less onerous for Ukraine than those proposed initially.</p>
