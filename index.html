          <p>President Trump stated that he would decide within two weeks whether to strike Iran, allowing time for diplomacy. He acknowledged Israel's limited capacity to fight without U.S. aid and emphasized the need for toughness to achieve peace. Trump noted the difficulty in asking Israel to halt attacks while diplomacy is pursued, highlighting ongoing discussions with Iran. Iran's foreign minister insisted Israel must cease aggression before negotiations can proceed, complicating diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, citing that he is not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, was initially held under a determination by the Secretary of State but remained detained on allegations of omitting details from his green card application. The judge dismissed the government's request to stay the decision, stating that Khalil's detention appeared to be an effort to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. The White House plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted by a grand jury in Colorado for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found in September 2023 after she went missing in May 2020. Although charges against him were previously dropped in April 2022, the indictment alleges Suzanne's death was a homicide caused by intoxication from a chemical mixture known as BAM, commonly used to sedate animals. Prosecutors claim Barry Morphew, a former deer farmer, had exclusive access to BAM in the area, a detail central to the case against him. Morphew denies any involvement in his wife's death and previously sued prosecutors for wrongful charges.</p>

Legislation has been introduced to prevent Trump from involving the U.S. military in unauthorized hostilities in Iran. A Fox News poll indicates that most voters believe Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear program would increase danger, but also see Iran as a national security threat.</p>

This decision was overshadowed by actions from President Trump and congressional Republicans to disapprove regulations that would have allowed California to enforce new regulations for zero-emission vehicles.

          <p>Republicans' proposed student loan repayment plan, known as the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), could result in higher monthly payments for many federal student loan borrowers compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan. The RAP would offer two repayment options: a standard plan with fixed payments or an income-based plan. Under RAP, borrowers could face longer repayment timelines of up to 30 years, potentially delaying major life milestones. Critics argue that the plan may push more borrowers into default due to unaffordable monthly bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The judge ruled that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The policy was deemed arbitrary and lacking specificity, undermining the states' ability to maintain roads and infrastructure. The administration argues that these policies hinder efforts to apprehend undocumented immigrants, while some jurisdictions say that forcing local police to cooperate with ICE could reduce trust in law enforcement.</p>
