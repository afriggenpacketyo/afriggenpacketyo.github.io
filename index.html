        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration is actively considering a substantial trade retaliation against China, including an embargo on cooking oil, due to Beijing's deliberate refusal to purchase U.S. soybeans. Trump characterized China's actions as an "Economically Hostile Act" causing significant hardship for American soybean farmers. The President suggested the U.S. could easily produce its own cooking oil, lessening dependence on China, whose exports of used cooking oil to the U.S. recently hit record highs. These threats have contributed to stock market volatility and uncertainty over future trade talks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to pressure FIFA and the International Olympic Committee to remove 2026 World Cup games from Boston and the 2028 Olympics from Los Angeles. Citing concerns over public safety and local political leadership, Trump indicated he would intervene if he deemed conditions unsafe. While he lacks direct legal authority, Trump asserted he could influence these decisions, emphasizing his close relationship with FIFA's president. These remarks follow similar threats against other U.S. host cities and reflect Trump's willingness to use his influence over major sporting events.</p>

This divergence, also observed by the University of Michigan's consumer survey, indicates that well-off Americans continue to spend, while lower earners face increasing financial strain.</p>

          <p>A study reveals a stark disconnect between Gen Z's top values—self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people—and what hiring managers seek: achievement, learning, and hard work. This generational gap, with only 2% of Gen Z sharing their bosses' priorities, leads to frustration for both companies and young people, who are often labeled "unemployable." The article advises Gen Z to honestly assess their financial needs and consider temporarily embracing values like achievement and work-centrism if urgent employment is a priority, suggesting a long-term commitment for results.</p>

Now in its 14th day, the shutdown sees Republicans and Democrats blaming each other, with Senate Democrats pushing for healthcare fixes in exchange for funding votes. Senator Tim Kaine emphasized the need for Trump to engage with Democrats to resolve the impasse, which has led to disruptions and furloughed federal workers.</p>

          <p>The IRS has released the 2026 capital gains tax brackets, featuring increased earnings limits for the 0% long-term capital gains rate. Single filers can earn up to $49,450 in taxable income, and married couples up to $98,900, to qualify for the 0% rate, offering significant tax planning opportunities for investors. Financial experts suggest this allows for rebalancing or diversifying taxable portfolios without triggering a tax bill, especially after strong market performance. However, selling profitable assets will increase taxable income, requiring careful projections. (not investment advice)</p>

While economic growth is expected to be modest at 1.3%, per capita output growth remains low. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the economy feels "stuck" and aims to reassure investors.
