          <p>The first group of seven Israeli hostages has been released by Hamas to the Red Cross, with all 20 living hostages expected to be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as part of a ceasefire deal. US President Donald Trump is in the region for a high-stakes peace summit in Egypt, aiming to finalize an agreement to end the two-year Israel-Hamas war, which he has declared "over." International efforts for Gaza's reconstruction are also underway, with Germany pledging significant funds, while Iran has opted not to attend the summit, criticizing US and Israeli actions. Aid convoys are now entering Gaza, and Germany is reassessing its arms export restrictions to Israel, reflecting the complex diplomatic landscape surrounding the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are largely set to open higher, demonstrating resilience despite a fresh trade dispute brewing between the U.S. and China. This positive sentiment follows U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of new tariffs on Chinese imports, a retaliation to China's recent export controls on critical rare earth minerals. Trump later softened his stance, posting that trade relations "will all be fine," which helped alleviate some market fears after Friday's sell-off. Investors are closely monitoring the situation for potential escalation, while also looking ahead to upcoming third-quarter earnings reports and the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington this week.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent stock market rally, which saw benchmarks surge to multi-year highs, is now facing a significant test as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions threaten investor optimism. The possibility of President Trump imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, in response to China's rare earth export controls, has revived fears of a full-blown trade war, causing Chinese indexes to drop over 2% on Monday. Analysts warn that the previous market rally was predicated on geopolitical stability, and the current tariff rhetoric could quickly unravel sentiment, potentially leading to a market pullback or sideways trading. The stakes are high, with some experts suggesting a prolonged confrontation could lead to a global recession. (not investment advice)</p>

In a 2022 interview, Burrell detailed experiences of racial abuse, including "slave" comments and "jokes" he endured while playing for Newcastle, claims which an RFU report later found to be true "on the balance of probability." He also reported discrimination within the England setup, noting that such racism had become normalized as "banter." His revelations have prompted the Rugby Football Union to implement an action plan for inclusivity, though Burrell believes the personal cost to his career was immense.</p>

          <p>The annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington are now dominated by concerns over the rekindled U.S.-China trade war. President Trump's threat of 100% duties on Chinese imports, a response to China's expanded export controls on rare earths, has shattered hopes for a trade thaw and sent markets into a tailspin. Finance chiefs were initially prepared to discuss global economic resilience, but now face the prospect of a full-blown trade conflict that could plunge the world's two largest economies into a deep recession. Experts suggest Trump's threats could be negotiating leverage, but warn of significant market volatility and potential economic pain if tariffs are reimposed. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to President Trump's assertions, early indications suggest that U.S. companies and consumers are largely bearing the cost of the country's new import tariffs. Academic studies and business surveys reveal that importers are footing the bill and passing some of it onto consumers, leading to upward pressure on prices. Imported goods have become about 4% more expensive since tariffs began in March, with domestic products rising by 2%. This analysis complicates the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation and indicates that the full impact of the tariffs, worth around $30 billion per month, is still unfolding, with global trade also expected to suffer.

          <p>China's government has strongly condemned President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, labeling it "a typical example of US double standards." A commerce ministry spokesperson warned of unspecified "countermeasures" if the threat is carried out, asserting that China is "not afraid" of a trade war. This rhetoric echoes past trade conflicts, criticizing U.S. export restrictions on chips and semiconductors while defending China's own rare earth export controls as normal national security measures. Although Trump later posted a more conciliatory message, the renewed fears of a trade war have already rattled financial markets in both the U.S. and Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated he is considering sending Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, a move he described as potentially providing "a new step of aggression" in the war with Russia. This consideration follows recent discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks. Tomahawk missiles, with a range of 2,500 km, could put Moscow within reach for Ukraine, a prospect Russia has previously warned would significantly escalate the conflict. Trump stated he might use this as leverage in potential talks with Russia, questioning if they "want Tomahawks going in their direction."</p>

Conversely, the offspring of inactive fathers performed worse in running and strength tests.

Instead of Ohtani pitching Game 2, Yoshinobu Yamamoto will take the mound, allowing him to stay on his regular five-day rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This strategic move means Ohtani will likely make only one pitching start in the series, but it also gives him an opportunity to focus solely on his hitting, as he struggled at the plate in the NL Division Series, going one for 18 with nine strikeouts.

          <p>A "winter-like" storm is forecast to hit Southern California from late Monday through Wednesday, bringing widespread heavy rainfall and a chance of locally damaging winds, hail, and brief tornadoes. A flood watch has been issued for much of the region, particularly near recent burn scars from the Eaton and Palisades fires, raising concerns for hazardous flooding and debris flows. Coastal and valley areas could see up to 1½ inches of rain, while mountains might receive 3½ inches. State and local officials are pre-positioning resources, bracing for the unusually strong October storm. This early-season event coincides with the official return of La Niña, which typically drives drier winters for the region.</p>

          <h2>Andrew Ross Sorkin Warns of 1929 Market Parallels Amid AI Boom</h2>

          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, author of "1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History," warns of alarming similarities between today's market and the pre-crash era of 1929. He suggests the current economy, propelled by an AI and technology boom, might be a "sugar rush," and asserts a market crash is inevitable, though its timing and depth are unknown. Sorkin highlights rampant speculation, increasing market debt, and the erosion of regulatory "guardrails" designed to protect investors since 1929, noting that SEC rules have become less stringent. He criticizes calls to "democratize" investing in riskier private assets, fearing it could expose ordinary Americans to greater financial peril. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Days of Our Lives" actor Arianne Zucker has reached a settlement with the show's producers regarding her 2024 lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and discrimination on set. Zucker accused now-former executive producer Albert Alarr of "severe and pervasive harassment," including unwanted physical contact and sexually charged comments. She also claimed retaliation, with her pay decreased and character written off after she voiced concerns. While Alarr's attorney stated he denies the allegations, the settlement brings an end to the litigation. Corday Productions had previously stated Zucker's claims were "without merit" but confirmed Alarr's termination after an impartial investigation.</p>
