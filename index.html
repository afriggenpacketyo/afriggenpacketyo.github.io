          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 118 deaths, with numerous people still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose to extreme levels, heavily impacting a girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, where at least 27 campers and counselors perished. In response, President Trump has declared a major disaster, and extensive search and rescue operations are ongoing, involving local, state, and federal agencies. The article details the human toll, the official response, and the meteorological factors that led to the sudden and intense deluge.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expanded his aggressive trade policy by sending letters dictating new tariff rates to the leaders of six more nations, including the Philippines, Iraq, and Libya. This follows a similar action two days prior where 14 other countries were notified of steep new duties, ranging from 20% to 40%, set to begin on August 1. The administration has indicated there will be no extensions to this deadline. These moves signal a continuation of the president's strategy to reset global trade relationships through significant economic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has delivered a significant ruling, finding Russia guilty of extensive human rights violations and war crimes in Ukraine. The court specifically condemned the abduction of children, the use of sexual assault as a weapon of war, and Russia's role in the 2014 downing of flight MH17. While Russia's exclusion from the Council of Europe makes the ruling largely symbolic, it serves as a powerful public rebuke of Moscow's actions. Ukraine hailed the decision as a historic victory, whereas the Kremlin dismissed it as "null and void."</p>

          <p>Ukraine's air force reported that Russia launched its largest single-day air attack of the war, firing 728 drones and 13 missiles at targets in western Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense systems successfully intercepted the vast majority, downing 711 drones and seven missiles. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, which primarily targeted the Volyn region near Poland, calling it a telling sign of Russia's rejection of peace efforts. In response, he has urged Western allies to impose more severe sanctions on Moscow's energy sector.</p>

          <p>Freddie, a 5-year-old beagle working for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is returning to his post at Dulles International Airport two weeks after being intentionally kicked by a traveler. The incident occurred when Freddie alerted his handler to prohibited agricultural items in the man's luggage. The traveler, an Egyptian national, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal and was sentenced to time served. Freddie, a rescue dog trained to detect illicit food items, has recovered from his injuries and is ready to resume his important work protecting U.S. agriculture.</p>

          <p>Colorado State University has slightly reduced its forecast for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, now predicting 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Despite the reduction, this forecast still indicates an above-normal level of storm activity compared to the average season. The adjustment was attributed to strong, cyclone-disrupting wind shear in the Caribbean. However, this is balanced by warmer-than-average Atlantic sea surface temperatures and a neutral climate pattern, which together create conditions conducive to storm formation.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission reveals new insights into lunar history. The research, published in Nature, suggests a massive asteroid impact over 4 billion years ago not only created the vast South Pole-Aitken basin but also fundamentally changed the composition of the moon's mantle deep below. The returned volcanic rocks are chemically different from any near-side samples, being depleted in elements like titanium and thorium. This provides a unique window into the moon's violent past and geological evolution.</p>

Critics and a federal judge argue that the city's "CARE-plus" cleanups, which often involve destroying tents and belongings without providing housing, do not constitute a genuine resolution. A federal judge ruled the city cannot count these cleanups toward its goal unless they are accompanied by an offer of shelter.

          <p>Scientists have found that using simple, evocative analogies can provide an immediate boost to running performance. A study with young soccer players from the Tottenham Hotspur academy discovered that focusing on external, environmental cues rather than internal body movements led to faster sprints. For instance, telling players to "accelerate like a Ferrari" or "sprint as if you are a jet taking off" was more effective than technical instructions. The research suggests that using relatable analogies can produce performance gains that would typically require weeks of physical training.</p>

This has fueled speculation that the freeze, which pulls more people into higher tax brackets as wages rise, could be extended to raise government revenue. The Conservative opposition accused the government of planning a "retirement tax" that would impact millions of pensioners. (not investment advice)</p>

As F1's female fanbase grows, the handling of such issues is a pivotal moment for the sport.
