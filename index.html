          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in multiple deaths and several injuries, including five firefighters. Officials described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy," with firefighters arriving to find heavy flames and residents needing rescue from windows. The facility housed approximately 70 people, and the exact number of fatalities is still being determined as investigations into the cause of the blaze continue. Authorities have set up an information center for families at a local hospital.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old palliative care specialist in Germany is on trial, accused of murdering 15 patients with lethal injections between 2021 and 2024. Prosecutors allege the doctor acted with a "lust for murder," behaving as a "master of life and death" by administering deadly drug cocktails to patients in their homes. The investigation began after a co-worker grew suspicious of the number of deaths, some of which were followed by fires allegedly set to conceal the crimes. The case has drawn comparisons to other instances of medical professionals committing serial murders in Germany.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, exceeding $120,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional investment. This rally coincides with the U.S. House of Representatives beginning 'Crypto Week' to deliberate on new legislation aimed at providing regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry. Analysts attribute the momentum to sustained institutional buying and increasing confidence from clearer global policies, particularly regarding stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marking 4,000 days since her son, Israeli soldier Hadar Goldin, was killed and his body captured by Hamas during a 2014 ceasefire, Leah Goldin is making a public plea. She is urging the Trump administration to ensure that any diplomatic agreements in the region, including normalization deals with Saudi Arabia, are conditioned on the return of her son's remains. Goldin emphasizes that returning the deceased is a matter of international law and a necessary humanitarian step for achieving genuine peace and stability.

The inquiry was launched following a BBC News investigation, and the BBC has since confirmed it has no plans to work with Wallace in the future.

          <p>The seventh series of Love Island USA has concluded, with Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales winning the $100,000 prize. While the finale celebrated the winning couple, it also cast a spotlight on the severe cyberbullying contestants faced throughout the season. The online harassment became so intense that the show aired a statement condemning it, and one former contestant shared messages that included death threats and threats of sexual assault, highlighting a darker side of reality television fame.</p>

          <p>At least 30 people have been killed in southern Syria's Suweida province following armed clashes between local Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin tribal fighters. The violence reportedly ignited after the abduction of a Druze merchant and quickly escalated, with fighting spreading to multiple neighborhoods and surrounding towns. Syria's interior ministry has described the situation as a "dangerous escalation" and is deploying security forces to impose order in a region already suffering from instability and a collapse of security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into what Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is and why its classification as a "green" or "bridge" fuel is highly controversial. While natural gas emits less CO2 than coal when burned, its production and transport release significant amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than CO2 in the short term. Critics and some studies argue that due to these methane leaks and the energy-intensive liquefaction process, LNG's overall climate impact can be even worse than that of coal.</p>

The proposed increase must be approved by parliament, which faces the difficult task of balancing national security needs with broader austerity measures aimed at reducing France's large budget deficit.
