          <p>This article profiles Bob Worsley, a conservative Republican advocating for a more generous and welcoming immigration policy. Worsley argues that with the U.S.-Mexico border practically sealed, it's time to focus on creating larger legal pathways for immigrants to enter the country. He emphasizes the need for a secure workforce as much as a secure border, citing the labor needs of various industries. Worsley's views stand in contrast to the prevailing anti-immigrant sentiment within the MAGA-fied Republican Party.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the dysfunction of the United States Congress is a central cause of many of America's problems.

The piece emphasizes that Congress is where political compromise is supposed to happen, and its failure to do so has undermined democratic legitimacy and shifted power to the executive branch.</p>
