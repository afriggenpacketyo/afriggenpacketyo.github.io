          <h2>Trump's New Travel Ban Includes Exceptions for World Cup Athletes</h2>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban includes exceptions for World Cup players, dual citizens, and individuals with existing visas, allowing them to enter the U.S. despite the restrictions imposed on citizens from specific countries. The proclamation, citing national security interests, aims to address insufficient vetting processes in certain nations. This policy mirrors a similar travel ban from 2017 that faced criticism and legal challenges before being upheld by the Supreme Court, but was later ended by President Joe Biden in 2021. This exception suggests a balance between security concerns and the facilitation of international events and travel. The optimism score is not directly related to this article.</p>

          <p>Pete Alonso's two home runs powered the Mets to a 6-1 victory over the Dodgers, contributing to the Dodgers' struggles in June. Alonso's performance included his first multi-homer game of the season and a season-high five RBIs, while Griffin Canning pitched six strong innings for the Mets, allowing only three hits. The Dodgers' only run came from Andy Pages' solo home run in the ninth inning, and the team faces additional concerns as Tommy Edman may be headed to the injured list. The Mets capitalized on early opportunities and Alonso's power to secure the win, showcasing a strong offensive performance.</p>

          <p>Japanese police investigated a record number of stalking cases in 2024, prompting increased emphasis on addressing such complaints. The National Police Agency has instructed prefectural headquarters to work more closely with local stations to improve responses to stalking incidents. This focus intensified after the death of Asahi Okazaki, who had reported abuse from her former partner. The agency also reported a record number of restraining orders issued, indicating a growing awareness and legal response to stalking. The revised statistical methods now include all relevant cases, providing a more comprehensive view of the issue.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the Boeing 737 Max crashes has criticized the deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant". The deal allows Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution by paying $1.1 billion, including compensation to victims' families and funds for safety improvements. The crashes, which killed 346 people, were linked to faulty flight control systems, and the lawyer argues the payout is insufficient. Relatives of the victims will have an opportunity to appeal the deal, expressing outrage and seeking greater accountability from Boeing.</p>

          <p>Cheap Chinese solar panels are flooding Pakistan, undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants and creating stranded assets, according to a report by Renewables First. Pakistan has become the second-largest destination for Chinese solar panels due to its zero tax rate on solar imports. This influx of solar power is challenging Pakistan's existing thermal power generation infrastructure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an opinion piece, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration disrupt the global trading system and weaken economic ties that stabilize international relations. The author argues that raising tariffs undermines free trade agreements and hinders the work of the World Trade Organization. Denying low-income countries the opportunity to develop their economies through trade could lead to increased migration. The constant threat of tariffs hurts consumers worldwide through higher prices and limited choices, potentially leading to political discontent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Biden conspired to conceal his cognitive decline by misusing an autopen to exercise presidential responsibilities. Trump alleges that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures to enact radical policy shifts while shielding the public from Biden's mental state. The investigation will focus on any activities that purposefully hid information about Biden’s health, any agreements to deem videos of Biden's cognitive ability as fake, and which policy documents the autopen was used for. House Republicans are also investigating Biden's mental fitness to authorize the autopen's use.</p>

          <p>The Education Department has stated that Columbia University has violated federal antidiscrimination laws and failed to meet accreditation standards. Citing President Trump's executive order, the department accuses the university of failing to address antisemitism on campus after the Oct. 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. Losing accreditation would mean Columbia would be ineligible to offer federal financial aid to students. Columbia has responded by stating that the school is deeply committed to combating antisemitism on campus and is continuing to work with the federal government to address it.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging top aides masked his predecessor’s “cognitive decline”. The investigation will build on a Republican-led campaign to discredit the former president and overturn some of his executive actions. Biden dismissed the idea of a cover-up as “ridiculous”. GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden’s top aides about his “mental and physical faculties”.

Soliman's wife, Hayam El Gamal, is an Egyptian citizen with a pending EB-2 visa, and the family entered the United States in late August 2022.</p>

          <p>The first bacteria that colonize a baby's gut may protect against dangerous infections, according to a UK study. Researchers found that infants with Bifidobacterium longum in their gut had half the risk of hospitalization for lung infections. The early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how the immune system develops. The study analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups by granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting restart efforts on an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County’s coastline. The operation's onshore pipeline system suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The court’s temporary restraining order on pipeline work will remain in effect through at least July 18. Sable officials said the decision would force them to push back their restart timeline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado temporarily blocked federal immigration officials from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack. U.S. District Judge Gordon Gallagher issued the order to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken Soliman's wife and children into custody. Soliman is facing multiple counts of attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge for the attack on marchers supporting Israeli hostages.</p>
