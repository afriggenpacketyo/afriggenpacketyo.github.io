          <p>Shedeur Sanders, after unexpectedly sliding through the early rounds, was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. Sanders entered the draft as a highly regarded quarterback prospect, with projections placing him in the first or second round. Despite multiple opportunities for other teams to select him, Sanders remained on the board until Day 3. He expressed gratitude and optimism after being selected, ending his long wait to play in the NFL.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' and 'sex' as biological. The guidance states that trans women (biological men) should generally not be permitted in women's facilities in places like hospitals and shops, but trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. The EHRC emphasizes that the law still protects transgender people from discrimination, and mixed-sex facilities should be provided where possible to accommodate everyone. A consultation is expected to launch in May to gather views on the guidance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has faced criticism for deporting a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras and the mother of a one-year-old girl to Cuba, separating them indefinitely. Lawyers argue these actions violate due process, as the individuals were arrested during routine check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The ACLU and other groups condemned the deportations, highlighting potential abuses of power. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to investigate the deportation of the two-year-old, expressing concerns that it occurred 'with no meaningful process'.</p>

          <p>ESPN's Pete Thamel offered an explanation for Shedeur Sanders' slide in the 2025 NFL Draft, citing feedback from multiple teams who did not view him as a first-round talent. Teams questioned Sanders' athleticism and his ability to throw in rhythm, believing his film did not immediately translate to the NFL level. Thamel noted that only one quarterback has been selected in the second round of the NFL Draft since 2023, indicating a recent trend of teams bypassing the quarterback position in the early portion of day two.</p>

          <p>A letter written aboard the Titanic by first-class passenger Archibald Gracie IV, a famous survivor of the disaster, was auctioned for almost $400,000. Penned on April 10, 1912, the day the Titanic set sail, the letter expresses Gracie's initial impressions of the ship. Gracie survived the sinking by clinging to an overturned lifeboat and later wrote a detailed account of the disaster. The letter, believed to be the only one he wrote on the Titanic, was purchased by a private collector from the United States.</p>

          <p>Craig Moffett, a leading analyst, suggests that shifting U.S. iPhone assembly to India may not effectively reduce costs tied to tariffs, as the components would still be manufactured in China. Moffett contends that diversifying to India is not straightforward, as Apple's supply chain would remain anchored in China and face potential resistance. He also notes that carriers are unlikely to absorb tariff costs, potentially impacting consumer demand. Moffett has a 'sell' rating on Apple and a price target of $141, citing valuation concerns and potential backlash against Apple in China.</p>
