          <p>Hefin David, a Labour Member of the Senedd (MS) for Caerphilly, has died suddenly at the age of 47. Gwent Police confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious. Tributes have poured in from across the political spectrum, including from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan, who remembered him as a passionate and dedicated public servant. David was known for his lively contributions to Senedd debates and his commitment to his constituents, whom he had represented since 2016. He is survived by his partner, fellow MS Vikki Howells, and his children.</p>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the notion of a "China Shock 2.0," arguing that China's advancements in green technology are constructive rather than destabilizing. The author posits that while the original "China Shock" involved lost manufacturing jobs in the West, the current wave is about building new industries like electric vehicles and clean energy. The piece highlights that China installed more solar capacity in 2023 than the rest of the world combined, significantly driving down global costs for green technology. It concludes that China is effectively underwriting the world's green transition, a role distinct from simply competing in established markets.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate the Trump administration is considering a list of 11 individuals to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair when his term ends. The list includes previously unmentioned names such as Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside figures like Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. According to officials, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct interviews to narrow down the candidates before presenting a final list to the president. The extensive list and deliberative process suggest a final decision is not imminent, providing some stability to monetary policy in the interim.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with Mo Amer, the creator and star of the Netflix comedy series "Mo." The show, a first-of-its-kind Palestinian-American sitcom, draws heavily from Amer's own life, exploring the complexities of the American immigration system and the longing for a connection to his family's homeland. Amer discusses the experience of translating his personal story into a narrative for a broad audience. He also reflects on the responsibility and challenges of becoming a prominent spokesperson for the Palestinian-American community, particularly in the current social and political climate, and how he navigates this role through his comedic work.</p>

          <p>During a dominant performance against the Atlanta Braves, the New York Mets baseball team hit a total of six home runs, leading to an unusual problem at their home stadium, Citi Field. The home run celebration pyrotechnics were used so frequently that the stadium completely ran out of fireworks. A message on the videoboard humorously apologized to fans for the inconvenience caused by the offensive onslaught. The game was also notable for Pete Alonso, who hit two of the home runs, surpassing Darryl Strawberry to become the Mets' all-time franchise leader in home runs with 254.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry announced that it had warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer, which it claims illegally entered its territorial waters near the Scarborough Shoal. The U.S. Seventh Fleet refuted this, stating the warship was conducting a routine "freedom of navigation operation" in accordance with international law and calling China's statement false. This incident elevates tensions in the South China Sea, a region with overlapping territorial claims, particularly between China and the Philippines. The event follows recent clashes between Chinese and Filipino vessels and occurs amid a broader trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.</p>

This surge, the strongest since last April, coincided with a decrease in the average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 6.67%. The Mortgage Bankers Association noted a significant increase in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which rose 25% as their rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. However, the lower rates had a minimal impact on home purchase applications, which only saw a 1% increase for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

The cancellations have significant economic consequences for these towns, hurting local immigrant-owned businesses and resulting in lost revenue from permits and sponsorships.

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," directed by Zach Cregger, centers on the mysterious disappearance of 17 children, with suspicion immediately falling on their unmarried schoolteacher, Justine. This article analyzes how the movie taps into a long-standing cultural trope where single, childless women are depicted as unstable, dangerous, and a threat to the social order. The film uses a multi-perspective structure to show how the community projects its fear and grief onto Justine, who becomes a scapegoat. Despite the harassment, she emerges as the film's unlikely hero, determined to uncover the truth, challenging the very stereotypes used to condemn her.</p>

Named Janjucetus dullardi, after the local who discovered it, the creature was about the size of a dolphin but was a formidable predator with a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth. The fossil belongs to the mammalodontids, a group of smaller, distant relatives of modern filter-feeding whales. This discovery provides new insights into early whale evolution and highlights the region as a crucial site for uncovering the history of marine mammals.</p>

          <p>The revival of the animated series "King of the Hill" returns to a suburban Texas that feels both familiar and, in today's climate, somewhat fantastical. This article argues that the show's focus on close-knit neighborly relationships and community support presents an idealistic vision of coexistence that seems increasingly rare. While the characters grapple with modern inconveniences and personal struggles, the show largely sidesteps the deep political and cultural divisions fragmenting many real-world American communities. By doing so, it offers a comforting, if unrealistic, playbook for belonging and mutual responsibility, reaffirming its core message about the value of committing to one's community.</p>

          <p>A recent tax and spending law enacted by the Trump administration includes the largest cut in history to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a major U.S. safety net. This article summarizes a podcast episode from The Indicator from Planet Money that examines the wide-ranging consequences of these reductions. The discussion explores not only how the cuts directly impact the food security of families who rely on the benefits, but also the ripple effect on the economy. It specifically highlights the significant financial strain placed on independent grocery stores, which often operate on thin margins and depend on SNAP-related purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cricket Australia's chief executive, Todd Greenberg, has issued a stark warning that the current structure of Test cricket could be financially unsustainable for some nations. He called for a revised, slimmed-down schedule that prioritizes quality over quantity to ensure the long-term viability of the sport's traditional red-ball format. Greenberg suggested that not every country needs to aspire to play Test cricket, arguing that forcing them to do so risks sending them into bankruptcy. His comments come as the International Cricket Council (ICC) has established a working group to explore potential changes, including a possible two-tier system for Test matches.</p>

After being alerted to the account, TikTok removed it, stating a "zero-tolerance approach to content promoting human smuggling."

          <p>Ukrainian military sources report that Russian forces are employing a new tactic of infiltrating the key city of Pokrovsk by disguising soldiers in civilian clothes. This strategy is part of an intensified Russian effort to seize as much territory as possible before a planned peace summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. These sabotage units are said to be attacking Ukrainian infantry, disrupting logistics, and spreading disinformation among the local population. The presence of disguised combatants complicates defense efforts, as Ukrainian soldiers must distinguish between civilians and enemies, limiting their use of heavy weaponry in populated areas.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the Truss government's mini-budget in September 2022, the average interest rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen below 5%. Financial data provider Moneyfacts described the drop to 4.99% as a "symbolic turning point" that indicates more aggressive competition among lenders. This development offers some relief to the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. However, with inflation forecasts recently revised upward, it is unlikely that the Bank of England's base rate will be cut further, limiting how much lower mortgage rates can go.
