        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a significant miss on first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue dropping 20% year-over-year. Net income also plummeted, largely attributed to line updates at vehicle factories and lower average selling prices. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's White House, focusing on downsizing the federal government and navigating tariffs, has raised concerns about increased production costs. The company refrained from promising growth this year and will revisit guidance in the next quarter, though stocks slightly increased after Trump's assurance about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, has been found guilty of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Prosecutors argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to obtain his life insurance and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, invoking their religious beliefs to justify the crime. Text messages presented as evidence showed Daybell discussing the life insurance policy and referencing a prophet who killed to follow God's command. She faces further legal battles, including accusations of conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband, and is currently serving a life sentence without parole for the deaths of her children.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the restoration of Voice of America (VoA), reversing President Trump's March executive order that dismantled the federally-funded news agency. Trump claimed VoA promoted biased reporting and dismantled its parent company, the United States Agency for Global Media. The lawsuit filed by VoA employees argued that the dismantling deprived the world of an objective news source, and the judge ruled in favor of a preliminary injunction, though the Trump administration is allowed to appeal the decision.</p>

The agencies will work with food companies to remove dyes from products, contingent on an "understanding" that consumers want them gone. The plan includes revoking authorization for two synthetic food colorings and eliminating six remaining synthetic dyes used in various food products. The move comes after previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 and aims to address concerns about the potential health effects of artificial dyes.</p>

          <p>California Rep. Robert Garcia led a delegation of Democratic lawmakers to El Salvador to demand the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to the country and imprisoned. The group met with U.S. Embassy officials, Abrego Garcia's family, and human rights advocates, but were denied access to Abrego Garcia. Garcia criticized the Trump administration for defying a Supreme Court ruling to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return and accused them of creating a constitutional crisis and instilling fear in immigrant communities.

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that high tariffs on goods from China would be reduced "substantially," but not eliminated entirely. This statement followed comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who deemed the high tariffs unsustainable. Trump's tariffs have caused market instability and increased interest rates. While Trump avoided confirming Bessent's sentiment, he assured a "very nice" approach to China and President Xi Jinping. China has cautioned against trade deals with the U.S. that could harm its interests.</p>

A 145% tariff on Chinese goods could dramatically curtail the region's trade with China, leading to less work across supply chains and higher costs for consumers.
