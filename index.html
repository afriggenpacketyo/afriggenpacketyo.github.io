            <p>Hutchmed is exploring alternatives for its blood-cancer drug's supply chain to mitigate the impact of the US-China trade war. The company recently received conditional approval in China for tazemetostat, an EZH2 inhibitor, for follicular lymphoma patients. Currently manufactured in the US, the drug faces potential tariffs upon import to China, prompting Hutchmed to evaluate options for cost reduction. The company also plans to conduct trials in China to broaden the drug's application to solid cancers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The "Made in USA" label signifies that virtually all of a product originates in the United States, including parts and assembly. The Federal Trade Commission oversees these claims, requiring that final assembly and a significant portion of manufacturing costs occur domestically. However, some foreign components are allowed if they don't substantially transform the product. Bilateral trade agreements, like USMCA, can override these rules, and labels like "Assembled in USA" have different requirements.</p>

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a friendly bacteria found in the large intestine, is associated with good health and helps maintain the gut barrier. It lives off mucin, a mucus layer separating human and microbial cells. Studies suggest it calms the immune system and may prevent obesity and diabetes. While it only eats mucus, a diet rich in fiber indirectly affects it, promoting short-chain fatty acid production. Eating a variable, high-fiber diet is crucial for maintaining a balanced microbiome.</p>

Imports, however, continued to decline due to sluggish domestic demand. Analysts anticipate a weakening of exports in the coming months as the U.S. tariffs take effect. China's leadership aims for a 5% annual growth target, but this goal faces challenges due to the escalating trade war and weak domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>
