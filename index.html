          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:15:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers and ensuring profitability. This type of content is cost-effective to produce and has high re-watch value, which helps reduce customer churn—a key factor in a streaming service's economic health. While live sports and blockbuster series drive new sign-ups, extensive kids' libraries give families a reason to maintain long-term subscriptions. Major players like Netflix and Disney are heavily invested in this strategy, even partnering with YouTube to maximize reach and discoverability among young audiences.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:11:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court for the release of grand jury testimony connected to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows public pressure and controversy over the administration's handling of Epstein-related files, particularly after a Justice Department memo stated no incriminating "client list" existed. Legal experts describe the government's request as highly unusual, noting the release process could be lengthy and complex, as it requires judicial approval and may face objections from individuals mentioned in the testimony. The action is widely seen as a response to growing criticism from within Trump's own political base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air travel disruptions have worsened this summer, with the national flight cancellation rate rising by 29% compared to the same period in 2024. Data analysis reveals that several East Coast airports, including Washington's Reagan National and Dulles, have experienced the most significant surge in cancellations and delays. Conversely, some airports like Miami International and San Francisco International have seen improved performance. Overall, while fewer flights were scheduled this summer, a higher percentage have been cancelled or delayed, contributing to widespread travel frustration for passengers across the country.</p>

          <p>Chevron is set to complete its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation following a favorable ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration panel rejected Exxon Mobil's claim that it held a right of first refusal over Hess's significant oil assets in the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. This decision resolves major uncertainty that had weighed on the deal, with Exxon stating it respects the ruling and will welcome Chevron to the joint venture. The outcome is a major strategic victory for Chevron in the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the Environment Agency, England experienced a 60% increase in serious water pollution incidents by water companies in 2024, reaching a record high of 2,801 total incidents. A cross-party committee of MPs described the situation as "woeful," blaming years of underinvestment and weak regulation for the rampant sewage pollution. Three companies—Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water—were responsible for the majority of the most severe events. The findings come ahead of a major review of the water industry, with critics calling for a complete overhaul of the regulatory system.</p>

Mamdani's treatment, from altered ad images to smears about "global jihad," is presented as an example of how racist tropes are deployed against Muslim political figures.

          <p>Russian customs officials have arrested a woman with dual U.S. and Russian citizenship at a Moscow airport, accusing her of attempting to smuggle a firearm. The Federal Customs Service stated that a Colt Commander pistol and three empty magazines were discovered in her suitcase during a random check. The woman, who was traveling from the U.S. via Turkey, reportedly claimed she was unaware of the need to declare the weapon. This arrest occurs amid heightened tensions and as several other American citizens remain imprisoned in Russia on various charges.</p>

          <p>An NHS doctor and her husband have each been sentenced to 10 months in jail for stealing and selling hospital personal protective equipment (PPE) on eBay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Attiya Sheikh and Omer Sheikh made nearly £8,000 by selling items like gloves and masks at a time when they were in critically short supply. The judge described the doctor's actions as an "egregious breach of trust," committed while she worked at a hospital in Scotland. The scheme was uncovered after an NHS supplier noticed its products being sold on the auction site.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned two regional Chinese lenders, Suifenhe Rural Commercial Bank and Heihe Rural Commercial Bank, as part of its 18th sanctions package against Russia. The banks were blacklisted for their alleged role in aiding Moscow's war effort, marking a significant step in the EU's efforts to curb third-country support for Russia. The move was finalized after Slovakia dropped its veto. Chinese officials had reportedly warned the EU against the measure, and the sanctions are expected to provoke a response from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing nationalist rhetoric, fueled by concerns over unruly tourists and crimes committed by foreigners. This comes as Japan's government aims to attract 60 million tourists annually and faces severe labor shortages due to an aging population. These right-wing groups are promoting a "Japanese First" platform, opposing reliance on foreign labor and reflecting a global trend of nationalist political movements.</p>

          <p>This article examines the enduring and corrosive influence of "The Turner Diaries," a 1978 neo-Nazi novel that has inspired domestic terrorists and helped popularize extremist ideas in American culture. The author notes that the book, which fantasizes about a race war leading to genocide, is readily available on Amazon, now marketed as a warning about the consequences of certain immigration policies. The piece draws parallels between the novel's hateful rhetoric and the language used in current U.S. politics, particularly concerning immigration, white grievance, and distrust of the media, suggesting the book's themes have seeped into mainstream discourse.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a significant shift in American public opinion, with attitudes toward immigration becoming more positive since President Trump began implementing his restrictive agenda. After years of rising anti-immigrant sentiment, a record 79% of Americans now view immigration as a good thing for the country, according to Gallup. This reversal suggests a "thermostatic" effect, where the public moves in the opposite direction of a president's policies. While support for some enforcement measures remains, disapproval of Trump's specific actions, such as suspending asylum programs and increasing raids, is growing.</p>

The Hemmings family claims the couple lost their home after taking out a loan to repay the stolen money.
