          <p>A new survey by the US-China Business Council reveals that American companies operating in China view the market as critical for their global competitiveness. This perspective persists despite challenges like frayed US-China relations, tariffs, and economic headwinds that have impacted sales and profitability. The survey, which included about 130 large corporations, indicates that while leaving China is not a viable option for most, less than half are optimistic about the future due to ongoing policy uncertainty and insufficient demand.

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, fell over 20% during its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public listing followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Trump Jr. celebrated the event as a "triumphant return" against "woke nonsense." The newly formed company, trading under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million in gross proceeds from the merger, continuing a trend of Trump family allies backing conservative-cause companies.

          <p>A top UN trade official, Rebeca Grynspan, has warned that President Trump's tariff policies are creating significant disruptions and uncertainty in global supply chains, paralyzing business decisions. UNCTAD has lowered its global GDP growth forecast, citing the paralyzing effect on trade and investment, and notes that the worst economic impacts have yet to hit less developed nations. The official stated that a layering of tariffs could create a "cascade" effect, potentially reducing exports from the most vulnerable countries by over 50%, threatening jobs and stability.

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly downplayed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling it "highly unlikely" just hours after reports suggested he told Republican lawmakers he intended to do so. The conflicting messages caused brief market volatility, with stocks dipping on the initial news and recovering after his denial. Trump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates faster, and some allies have raised questions about a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters, potentially as a pretext for removal for cause.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market rallied after the U.S. House of Representatives advanced procedural votes on key crypto regulation bills, renewing optimism for their potential passage. Bitcoin and ether saw significant price increases, along with related stocks like Circle and Coinbase, after a brief dip when the legislation was initially halted. The bills, particularly the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, are seen as crucial for providing regulatory clarity to the industry, and analysts believe their eventual passage is a matter of "when," not "if."

          <p>Many countries worldwide, including the United States, are experiencing declining birth rates as more families choose to have fewer or no children. This demographic shift is leading to rapidly aging populations and the prospect of future population shrinkage. The trend raises significant questions about the long-term economic and social future of these nations. Experts are examining the causes behind this global phenomenon and what its wide-ranging implications might be for societies and economies around the world.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is considering a Trump administration request to rescind $9 billion in previously approved spending, primarily targeting foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The measure, which narrowly advanced with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President, has faced opposition from some Republicans concerned about its impact. The Senate is now weighing amendments, including one to restore $400 million for an AIDS prevention program, which means the revised package must be sent back to the House for another vote before a fast-approaching deadline.</p>

          <p>A review of Theatricum Botanicum's summer season highlights two productions: "The Seagull: Malibu" and "Strife." The former reimagines Anton Chekhov's classic play in 1970s Malibu, capturing the "Me Generation" with a groovy, if not always subtle, approach that is largely amusing and effective until a poorly acted final act. The latter revives John Galsworthy's 1909 drama about a labor dispute, relocating it to 1890s Pennsylvania. While the acting is sometimes broad, the production is praised for reviving an intelligent and complex play that resonates with contemporary labor issues.</p>

          <p>In a podcast, commentator David Frum and former FBI official Peter Strzok discuss the increasing vulnerability of the FBI under the Trump administration. Strzok argues that Trump loyalists are dismantling the agency's core functions by purging experts, sidelining critical investigations, and using personnel reassignments as a tool of power, leaving the U.S. exposed to foreign threats. The discussion highlights that many of the norms protecting the FBI from political interference are based on tradition rather than law, making the institution fragile and susceptible to being hollowed out by malign leadership.</p>

While investors had largely priced in a rate cut, there is now renewed caution, though expectations remain that cuts will proceed later in the year, balanced against concerns of a weakening jobs market.

The investigation into that crash found that the fuel switches on the aircraft had flipped from "run" to "cutoff" almost simultaneously shortly after takeoff. The heightened scrutiny is part of an ongoing effort to ensure aviation safety.</p>
