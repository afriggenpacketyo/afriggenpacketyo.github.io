            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire after sources revealed he shared details about a U.S. airstrike in Yemen via a second Signal chat group. This chat, distinct from a previous incident, included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. The shared information allegedly included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets. The Pentagon's inspector general is already evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app, and this latest revelation may complicate ongoing investigations into potential leaks and security protocols.

            <p>China has warned that it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce cautioned about the risk to all countries if international trade returns to the "law of the jungle".

            <p>An analysis of HBO's "The Last of Us" Season 2 highlights its departure from the first season's focus on building bonds in impossible circumstances, shifting instead to explore how those bonds can fracture. The article critiques the show's unrelenting cheerlessness and its reliance on undiluted pain, arguing that it lacks the elegant insights of Season 1. While acknowledging moments of ingenuity, the review suggests the show's limited imagination and heavy focus on grief make it a punishing watch.</p>

            <p>Experts suggest several strategies for first-time homebuyers to get on the housing ladder, including starting to save early with a Lifetime ISA, exploring low-deposit mortgage options, and considering shared ownership. An "income boost" mortgage allows family members to increase borrowing potential without becoming homeowners. Professional mortgages can also be available. Mortgage rates are expected to decrease, making homeownership more accessible. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Men are less likely to visit doctors compared to women, with data indicating that fewer men attempt to contact their GP or register at a dental practice. This reluctance stems from societal expectations of masculinity, self-reliance, and concerns about appearing weak. Men also tend to see healthcare as treatment rather than prevention. Experts suggest that tailored services, appointment systems, and communication strategies could encourage men to seek medical help earlier.</p>
