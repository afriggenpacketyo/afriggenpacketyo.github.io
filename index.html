          <p>Representative Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on "Face the Nation" to discuss the recently passed House budget bill, which he criticized for cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance while adding trillions to the deficit, and for failing to simplify the tax code. Himes expressed concern over President Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, advocating for increased sanctions and continued arming of Ukraine to maximize leverage against Putin. He also addressed the politicization of intelligence, citing concerns that the White House is overriding intelligence community conclusions regarding Venezuela and the Tren De Aragua gang, and that Joe Kent pressured analysts to alter an assessment to avoid embarrassing the president. The article provides a comprehensive overview of Himes' views on key policy issues.</p>

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators to represent Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana, a move seen as an attempt by President Nicolás Maduro to stir nationalistic sentiment and consolidate his rule amid internal dissent. The election is occurring in a territory governed by Guyana, and it is unclear how Venezuela plans to administer the process, as the International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area. The dispute over Essequibo, which comprises about two-thirds of Guyana and includes significant offshore oil blocks, has been ongoing for decades, with Maduro recently ramping up claims to the region, leading to increased tensions and military activity near the border. The situation has garnered international attention, with the U.S. increasing military ties with Guyana and warning Venezuela against military action. </p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least seven children from the al-Najjar family, with two more missing and presumed dead, prompting the Israeli military to investigate potential harm to uninvolved civilians. The family's home was adjacent to a building storing car tires, which caught fire during the blast, exacerbating the destruction. The incident occurred amid escalated airstrikes and threats of a major ground assault in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has claimed the lives of over 50,000 people in Gaza. The New York Times provided the coordinates of the strike to the Israeli military, which stated it had targeted suspects near Israeli forces and was reviewing the incident.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley voiced his opposition to the proposed ban on the 'tush push' play, calling the efforts to eliminate it "soft." Barkley argued that any team can execute the play, and the Eagles' success is due to their strong offensive line and quarterback Jalen Hurts' strength. He also disputed claims that the play poses a risk to player safety, highlighting that other teams with athletic quarterbacks have not been as successful with it. The NFL owners ultimately voted against the proposal, allowing the play to remain legal for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A drone brigade called Kaskad offers short, safe deployments to politically connected Russians, providing a career boost to those who serve in the unit. Unlike ordinary Russian soldiers facing indefinite deployments and high casualties in the war against Ukraine, officials assigned to Kaskad typically stay for a few months, participate in photo opportunities, and return home with a hero's welcome. This practice allows Russian elites to sidestep regular military service requirements while potentially currying favor with the Kremlin, and several members of Parliament and pro-Kremlin youth activists have served in Kaskad.</p>

Michael Gupton's exuberant celebration, which included leaping, skipping, and yelling towards the Mercer dugout, led to heated exchanges and ejections of players and coaches. The situation escalated further when the mother of one of the ejected players jumped on the dugout roof, resulting in her removal from the stadium and a nearly 30-minute delay.

Ukrainian officials stated the attack demonstrates Moscow's lack of interest in a truce, as it follows a recent escalation in violence and a rise in civilian casualties despite cease-fire negotiations. The Ukrainian air force reported shooting down a significant portion of the incoming weapons, but the attacks have overwhelmed defenses, particularly in western and southern regions, while President Trump appears to be stepping back from cease-fire efforts, leaving Ukraine and Russia to find their own solution to the war.</p>

The two new studio blockbusters were big overseas, too. Globally, “Lilo & Stitch” collected $341.7 million including domestic ticket sales. The strong showing on Memorial Day weekend adds to a solid spring at the box office. The success of these films is seen as a positive sign for the theatrical business, which has been recovering from the pandemic and strikes.</p>

Trump stated that the home countries of some of Harvard's international students are "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." He added that the administration wants to "to know who those foreign students are" and that "Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming." This attack comes after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the administration's revocation, which Harvard argued was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment."</p>

Parsons argues that the administration's executive order ending DEI programs is an attempt to indoctrinate rather than educate, and he believes it's a betrayal of professional scholars by dictating which areas of inquiry are legitimate.</p>

Norris, Charles Leclerc, and Oscar Piastri all followed the same strategy of starting on the medium tire followed by two stints on the hard tire, splitting the race more or less into thirds, while Verstappen finished fourth after Red Bull ran him on an inverted strategy starting on the hards and switching to the mediums and delayed his final pit stop as late as possible.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is downplaying concerns about the potential for increased federal deficits resulting from the recently passed budget bill. Johnson hailed the bill as the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years, and arguably of all time," despite a Congressional Budget Office analysis suggesting it could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson rejected the CBO analysis, calling it "dramatically overstated," and argued that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing job creation. Republican senators have expressed skepticism about the bill, signaling plans to amend it due to concerns about rising deficits.</p>

          <p>Rescuers have located the bodies of five skiers near the luxury Zermatt resort in Switzerland, following a report of unattended skis near the Rimpfischhorn peak. The victims were found at varying altitudes on avalanche debris on the Adler Glacier, and the public prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident. Zermatt is a popular Alpine resort, but the climb to Rimpfischhorn is considered a more advanced expedition, requiring an overnight stay in a high hut. In a separate incident, Air Zermatt also conducted a challenging mountain rescue of four alpinists stranded on the Fiescherhörner.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his family have monetized the White House to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that would have previously provoked significant backlash and official investigations. The Trump family and its business partners have engaged in numerous ventures, including collecting fees from a new cryptocurrency, brokering overseas real estate deals, and opening an exclusive club in Washington, all while experts say that the Trump administration is a candidate for the most brazen use of government office in American history. The lack of outrage over these activities is attributed to the normalization of such schemes and the dismantling of accountability mechanisms, with critics struggling to gain traction without the usual channels of official review.</p>

The focus will instead be on improving services and infrastructure, as the government aims to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services in England by 2027, and members of the public have questioned the point of renationalising train operators if it does not reduce prices.</p>
