The article also emphasizes the safety of CDs, insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. It compares rates from different banks, advising readers to consider online banks and short-term CDs for potentially higher yields. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these figures, inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and the impact of Trump's trade policies introduces uncertainty into the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This opinion piece criticizes both President Trump's tariffs and Western sanctions, arguing that they are equally ineffective and often harmful. The author uses Syria as a case study, noting that Western sanctions have not achieved their intended goals but have instead exacerbated the country's economic problems. The author contends that sanctions are often used as a tool of neo-imperial outreach and have failed to alter the policies of targeted regimes. He advocates for free trade and the lifting of sanctions to promote economic recovery.</p>

            <p>This article provides an explainer on the escalating tariff war between the U.S. and China, detailing the current tariff rates on Chinese goods entering the United States. Since President Trump took office, tariffs on Chinese imports have increased by a combined 145%, including reciprocal duties and tariffs related to fentanyl production. When considering tariffs introduced before Trump's second term, the total tariff burden is approximately 156%. China has mirrored these moves by raising duties on U.S. imports by a total of 125% over the past two weeks.</p>

The government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US. It also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well.</p>
