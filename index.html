        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, stated that federal employee layoffs will commence if President Trump determines that shutdown negotiations with Congress have reached a complete impasse. The government shutdown, now in its fifth day, stems from a deadlock over Democratic demands for healthcare funding extensions in the budget. Republicans argue these issues should be addressed separately, escalating the standoff. Hassett expressed hope that Democrats would become more "reasonable" when they return, potentially averting the need for such drastic measures which the administration is preparing for.

          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a new immigration plan aiming to remove 750,000 migrants within five years, drawing inspiration from Trump-era US policies. The proposal includes banning asylum claims from anyone entering the UK without permission and replacing judicial appeals with internal Home Office reviews. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch stated that deportees would be sent to their country of origin or a safe third country. The plan involves rebranding the immigration enforcement unit into a "Removals Force" with a doubled budget and expanded powers to meet its ambitious targets.</p>

The service was held in Salford for Mr. Cravitz, who died after an assailant rammed a car into worshippers and stabbed them during Yom Kippur services. Friends and family remembered him as a loving, kind, and charismatic man deeply connected to his community. The attack, which also injured three others, has prompted a major police investigation, with four suspects remaining in custody on terrorism charges.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned the Trump administration's decision to federalize 300 members of the state's National Guard to manage protests. Pritzker stated he was given an ultimatum to either call up the troops himself or have the federal government do it, calling the move "outrageous and un-American." The White House confirmed the plan, citing a need to protect federal assets amid ongoing protests and clashes with federal agents in Illinois. The governor insists the troops are not needed and that this is a political move by the president to assert control.</p>

          <p>A severe blizzard on the north face of Mount Everest has trapped around 1,000 climbers at camps below the main base camp, according to Chinese state media. The climbers are situated at an altitude of approximately 4,900 meters, with reports of damaged tents and some casualties, though no fatalities have been confirmed. Persistent heavy snow and strong winds since Friday have hampered rescue efforts by making roads impassable.

          <p>A woman was shot by federal agents in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood after her vehicle and others allegedly boxed in the agents' car. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agents were rammed and, upon exiting their vehicle, saw a driver with a gun, prompting them to open fire. The injured woman, Marimar Martinez, and another man, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, were arrested and face charges of assaulting a federal officer. The incident led to tense standoffs between protesters and federal law enforcement at the scene, with DHS accusing Chicago police of not providing assistance.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, signaling significant financial growth in the sport, primarily concentrated in England's WSL and the US's NWSL. While rising fees indicate a healthier ecosystem compared to a decade ago, experts warn it is widening the gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete financially, with their broadcasting and sponsorship deals dwarfed by those in England and the US. This financial disparity risks creating a permanent elite tier, leaving other leagues unable to afford top talent.</p>

          <p>Democrats in Congress are embracing the political risks of a government shutdown in a unified effort to challenge what they view as President Trump's overreach and attacks on the constitution. Their primary demand is the inclusion of healthcare priorities, such as extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, in any new funding bill. Progressive groups are supporting the strategy, viewing it as a necessary stand against the administration's consolidation of power. While Republicans blame Democrats for the shutdown, early polling suggests the public is more inclined to hold the president and his party responsible. (not investment advice)</p>

Due to the displacement of millions and a fragile infrastructure, citizens will not vote directly; instead, appointed committees will select an "electoral college" of 6,000-7,000 people who will then vote for 121 parliamentarians from among their ranks. An additional 70 members will be directly appointed by the interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former militia leader. While the process includes some positive steps toward diversity, critics worry it gives the president too much control and lacks genuine democratic legitimacy.</p>

          <p>After an eight-year absence from acting, three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis is returning to the screen in "Anemone," a film directed by and co-written with his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. In a recent interview, the actor clarified that he never intended to fully retire but wanted to stop one kind of work to focus on others, including making fiddles. He revealed the main impulse to return was the knowledge that his son would be making films. The new movie tells the story of a man in self-exile, a role Daniel Day-Lewis felt he understood early in the writing process.</p>

          <p>A major overnight Russian aerial assault across nine regions of Ukraine has killed at least five civilians and targeted civilian infrastructure. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched over 50 ballistic missiles and hundreds of drones, with a combined strike killing four people in the western city of Lviv. Another civilian was killed in Zaporizhzhia, where the attack also destroyed residential buildings and caused widespread power outages. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems from Western partners to counter Russia's escalating "aerial terror" campaign against civilian targets.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its strategic efforts to attract top-tier scientific talent from abroad, a key component of its upcoming five-year plan. The recent high-profile appointment of former Harvard statistician Liu Jun at Tsinghua University highlights this trend, as he joins other globally recognized academics who have recently returned to China. This push to recruit elite minds from overseas and cultivate domestic talent is part of a broader strategy to gain a competitive edge in global science and technology. The move reflects an accelerating "brain gain" for China, reversing a long-standing trend of talent outflow.</p>

The achievement marks a significant turnaround for the club under coach Bradley Carnell, who took charge in January after the team failed to make the playoffs last season. The victory sparked jubilant celebrations at Subaru Park as the team was rewarded for its consistent performance throughout the year.</p>

          <p>Ohio's sole national forest, the Wayne National Forest, is at risk of being wiped out after being targeted by the Trump administration for increased lumber production. An executive order and a subsequent memo from the agriculture secretary identified the forest as a site for logging under an "emergency declaration," which also aims to remove environmental protections. Environmental groups and locals are concerned that large-scale logging could release pollutants from old coal mines trapped in the soil, contaminate waterways, and increase flood risks. The forest, established to restore land degraded by mining, is a critical habitat and popular recreation area.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Palestinian-Canadian author Saeed Teebi reflects on the struggle to have the Palestinian story heard and believed by the wider world. He explains that his new memoir was driven by a need to counter the dehumanizing narratives that emerged after the October 7 attacks, which he feels gave Israel cover for its subsequent actions in Gaza. Teebi notes a significant shift in public perception over the past two years, as firsthand accounts have challenged long-standing Israeli PR, creating a sense of "vindication" for what Palestinians have always known. However, he remains critical that this shift has yet to translate into meaningful governmental policy changes in the West.</p>

          <p>Driven by the massive electricity demands of AI and data centers, there is a growing resurgence of support for nuclear power in the United States, including for new small modular reactors (SMRs). A decommissioned plant in Michigan is set to be the first to be brought back online and will also host the nation's first SMRs, with local officials hopeful for economic stability. Tech giants like Microsoft and Google are investing in nuclear energy to power their operations, and public opinion is shifting, with a majority of Americans now supporting more nuclear power. While challenges remain, the technology is seen as a key solution to the looming energy crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive report details the growing climate of fear in immigrant communities due to the aggressive and often indiscriminate tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Using recent raids in Los Angeles and Chicago as examples, the article highlights how the Trump administration has tested legal limits, leading to violent confrontations and a breakdown of trust. A former ICE attorney interviewed for the piece described a push to "hit numbers and goals," lumping non-criminals with serious offenders. The report portrays a "David vs. Goliath" struggle for communities facing the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the government.</p>
