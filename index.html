The proposed policy would require recipients to work, participate in job training, or volunteer for at least 20 hours a week, with exceptions for those caring for young children or with health issues.

          <p>New Oklahoma education standards require students to identify 'discrepancies' in the 2020 election results, perpetuating false narratives about the election. The standards, championed by State Superintendent Ryan Walters, reference baseless claims about ballot counting and mail voting security. Critics argue that the standards prescribe students to accept these 'discrepancies' as fact, rather than encouraging critical thinking. The standards were enacted despite opposition from some Republicans and concerns about the rushed approval process.</p>
