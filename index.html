          <p>Amid escalating US-China trade tensions, China is strategically shifting its economic focus inward, aiming to reduce reliance on the US market. Beijing is implementing fiscal and monetary policies to boost domestic demand, particularly consumption. A key component is a substantial debt swap plan to aid local governments, reducing interest rates and promoting transparent debt management. This approach aims to transform China into a large consumer market, leveraging its robust policy tools to enhance economic resilience and self-sufficiency in the face of external pressures.

          <p>President Trump is providing temporary tariff relief to automakers, a move seen as a partial reversal of his protectionist trade policies. The decision allows importers of foreign auto parts to receive reimbursement for tariffs over the next two years. This adjustment aims to support domestic manufacturers while giving others time to invest in domestic plants. The administration touts this as a partnership with automakers and American workers, despite concerns about the economic impact of the broader tariff regime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mario Bustamente Leiva, accused of stealing the purse of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has been charged with robbery, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft in connection with three alleged bag thefts in Washington, D.C. The complaint says that Secret Service officers who executed a search warrant in the motel room where Bustamente Leiva was arrested found Noem's purse and wallet, an American Express gift card, more than $3,170 in cash and clothing that appears to match a jacket and sneakers he wore when he allegedly committed the robberies on April 17 and 20.</p>
