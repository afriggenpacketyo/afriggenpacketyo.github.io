          <p>A new study indicates cannabis use, particularly its active ingredient THC, negatively impacts female fertility. Researchers found THC disrupts egg cell development and genetic stability, leading to a lower rate of genetically healthy embryos in women undergoing IVF. While the study suggests women trying to conceive should abstain from cannabis, experts call for further research, noting limitations such as age and dosage data. This article highlights potential reproductive health risks associated with cannabis.</p>

          <p>China has issued multiple travel advisories warning its citizens about security risks in the Philippines, potentially impacting bilateral trade, investment, and education exchanges. Analysts suggest these warnings could slow economic ties, despite assurances that most Chinese visitors for legal purposes remain safe. The advisories, citing public security instability and crimes targeting Chinese citizens, come amidst broader geopolitical tensions between the two nations. This article explores the potential economic repercussions of these diplomatic warnings.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford made boxing history by defeating Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas, becoming the first male fighter in the modern era to achieve undisputed titles in three weight divisions. Crawford, jumping up two weight classes, delivered a masterclass performance against the fiercely pro-Alvarez crowd. The unbeaten 37-year-old showcased exceptional skill, power, and defense, securing a defining victory that cements his pound-for-pound status. Despite this monumental win, Crawford hinted at a possible retirement after his 42nd professional victory.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, the racist legacy of the Nuremberg Laws continues to influence discussions about German identity and equality. The article highlights how the far-right AfD party's rhetoric, distinguishing between 'real Germans' and 'passport Germans,' echoes the Nazi-era Reich Citizenship Law. Experts argue that racial discrimination based on ancestry persists, particularly affecting immigrants who do not experience the same promise of equality. This piece underscores the ongoing struggle to overcome antisemitic and racist prejudices in modern Germany.</p>

It details the intense media frenzy, controversial interrogation leading to Knox's initial confession, and shifting theories of the crime. Despite Knox's eventual exoneration after nearly four years in prison, the case highlights systemic issues in the Italian justice system. The complex legal battle underscores the impact of coerced confessions and the long quest for justice in a highly scrutinized international case.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the CHP, faces a critical trial that could declare its 38th party congress null and void, potentially invalidating its reform-minded leadership. The trial stems from challenges by the traditional nationalist wing, alleging illegal election processes and delegate vote-buying, following a leadership change after a significant election defeat. Observers suggest President Erdogan may be strategically exploiting internal divisions to weaken the CHP and its popular presidential candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu. The outcome, expected soon, could plunge the party into chaos, impacting Turkey's political landscape.</p>
