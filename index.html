          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public spat with President Donald Trump after Musk concluded his tenure with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. The feud, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value, wiping out billions in market capitalization. This conflict has strained a previously close relationship that was beneficial to Tesla, potentially impacting future regulations and government support, especially regarding tariff exemptions for Chinese-made manufacturing equipment. (not investment advice) The company also faces declining revenue, increased competition from Chinese EV makers, and quality issues with the Cybertruck, all while Musk urges investors to focus on autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. The company's board is facing increasing pressure to ensure Tesla's stability amid Musk's polarizing behavior, which threatens the brand's value.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is investing Â£50 million to expand the use of its app for communicating with patients, aiming to save Â£200 million over the next three years. Millions more patients will receive test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly on their smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. The department says 270 million messages will be sent through the NHS app this financial year, an increase of 70 million on the previous year. The changes are intended to provide patients with better access to manage their healthcare and make informed decisions, with services now used in 87% of hospitals across England.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a public feud following Musk's departure from his role as a special government employee. The dispute began after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending package, leading to a back-and-forth exchange on social media. Trump accused Musk of opposing the bill due to the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits, while Musk denied being consulted on the measure. In addition to the conflict with Musk, Trump held a meeting with the German Chancellor and spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss trade negotiations, emphasizing a positive conclusion for both countries.</p>

          <p>A prosecuting attorney in West Virginia, Tom Truman, warned that women who experience a pregnancy loss could face criminal charges under state laws related to the disposal of human remains. To avoid potential prosecution, Truman advised women to report miscarriages to local law enforcement. While abortion is restricted in West Virginia, neither abortion nor miscarriage are explicitly criminalized, but legal interpretations could lead to prosecution. Experts caution against involving law enforcement in reproductive health matters, emphasizing the need for understanding of the female reproductive system.</p>

The age-adjusted death rate has decreased by about a third, resulting in over 4 million fewer cancer deaths. This progress is attributed to factors such as the decline in smoking, the HPV vaccine, improved screening methods, and breakthroughs in treatments like autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy. While challenges remain, particularly with rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people, the overall trend indicates significant progress in the fight against cancer.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has been innovative in its use of drones, launching unprecedented attacks against Russian forces. From stealthy strikes on Russian warplanes to the use of sea drones, Ukraine is constantly developing new ways to wage war with drones, often catching Russia by surprise. These drones are creating problems for Russian ground forces by spotting and attacking troop gatherings. Russia has responded by increasing its own drone production, leading to a drone war with both countries launching hundreds of drones at each other nightly.</p>
