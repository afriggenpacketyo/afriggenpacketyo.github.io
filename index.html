          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has voiced his dislike for the new NFL-mandated helmets, comparing the design to a "damn spaceship." The 41-year-old veteran is struggling to find a comfortable replacement for his previous helmet, which is no longer approved under the league's updated safety standards. Rodgers is actively working to find a suitable solution before the upcoming season begins, highlighting the challenges some players face with new equipment regulations. He confirmed that the current season, his 21st in the league, is likely to be his last.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the deployment of ten new vans equipped with live facial recognition (LFR) technology across seven police forces in England. This expansion aims to help locate suspects for serious crimes such as homicides and sexual offenses by scanning faces in public and comparing them against wanted lists. While the government points to the technology's success in London, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have raised alarms about a significant expansion of state surveillance. The government is simultaneously holding a consultation to establish a new legal framework to ensure public trust and transparency.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will incorporate questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillator use into the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the millions of new drivers who take the test each year with basic life-saving knowledge, as they are often the first to arrive at emergency scenes. Learning materials have already been updated to include this information, emphasizing that immediate CPR and defibrillator use can dramatically increase cardiac arrest survival rates. This change reflects a public health effort to improve emergency response capabilities among the general population.</p>

Before Allen's return, McConkey had already been studying his film to improve his route-running skills, a craft at which Allen excels. Now working together on the field, the two have developed a strong rapport, with McConkey frequently seeking advice from the seasoned player. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman highlighted the positive impact of Allen's presence, noting the versatility and strength he adds to the team's offense and receiver group.</p>

The advisory affected approximately 9,200 households after a faulty valve from 1967 caused a major service disruption. Before resuming normal use, the DWP is urging residents to thoroughly flush their pipes, water heaters, and appliances to clear any stagnant water or sediment. The agency announced it will provide a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the country's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to Cameroonian President Paul Biya, Macron admitted France's role in events that cost tens of thousands of lives, including the killing of several independence leaders. This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France which detailed mass displacements and support for brutal militias by French colonial forces. The acknowledgement is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's complex and often violent colonial history in Africa.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers suspected of burglarizing actor Brad Pitt's home and targeting other high-profile individuals, including actors and athletes. The suspects, identified as members of a street gang, were apprehended after an investigation that began following the raid on Pitt's Los Feliz property in June. Authorities noted a trend of thieves using sophisticated methods, such as hidden cameras and Wi-Fi jammers, to monitor victims' routines. Police Chief Jim McDonnell warned that public figures and social media users can inadvertently make themselves targets by publicizing their locations and travel plans.</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are reporting a 30% reduction in their harvest this year, a problem attributed to warmer winter weather. The lack of consistent cold temperatures disrupted the natural sleep cycle of the stone fruit trees, which is essential for regulating their nutrients and ensuring a healthy crop. This has led to some growers losing their entire crop and has caused a rise in consumer peach prices. Farmers like the Masumoto family are relying on older, more resilient tree groves and traditional irrigation methods to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their livelihood.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's car manufacturing industry is experiencing a severe downturn, with production levels at their lowest since 1953. Recent factory closures, including Vauxhall's Luton plant and Honda's Swindon factory, symbolize a long-term decline exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty, high energy costs, and the challenging transition to electric vehicles. Experts warn that the industry is approaching a critical point where losing more manufacturing capacity could cause the entire support ecosystem to collapse, threatening thousands of jobs. The article questions whether the industry can be saved through new investments or by attracting Chinese manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has struck an unusual deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% share of the sales revenue for the U.S. government. This unprecedented arrangement has drawn criticism from lawmakers and legal experts, who question its legality and potential national security risks. The U.S. Constitution bars taxes on exports, creating legal hurdles for the deal's implementation. Critics argue that treating semiconductor exports as both a national security threat and a revenue source sends a contradictory signal to China and U.S. allies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), sparking serious concern among economists. The nomination is viewed as highly partisan for a traditionally nonpartisan agency, especially since Trump recently fired the previous commissioner over a jobs report he deemed unfavorable. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the agency and recently suggested that the BLS should consider suspending its monthly jobs reports in favor of less frequent quarterly data. This has fueled fears that the administration may pressure the agency to manipulate crucial economic data.</p>

Cramer suggested that many of President Trump's controversial actions are not directly related to corporate profitability and that successful companies have adapted to the political environment.

The new charges allege that Price voted on motions that would benefit L.A.

Price was initially charged in 2023 for allegedly voting on developer projects that also had financial ties to his wife.

The review will examine public-facing content and curatorial processes ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The location is historically significant as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, and it provides a geographically logical midpoint. The summit was announced after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, though multiple rounds of talks have so far failed. The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise" for the president, while Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, who is not attending, has insisted that no binding decisions can be made without his country's participation.</p>

Altman responded by accusing Musk of manipulating X's algorithm to benefit his own companies, escalating their public war of words.

A recent paper from Chinese scientists detailed an early phase of the war where Russia successfully jammed a wide range of satellite navigation systems, including the U.S. GPS, Europe's Galileo, and China's own Beidou system. This event, described by some as the first major electronic warfare clash between great powers, provided a valuable real-world case study for China.
