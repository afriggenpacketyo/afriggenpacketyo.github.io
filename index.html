          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $78,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility stemming from President Trump's newly imposed global tariffs, mirroring trends in tech stocks. Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and Solana's token, also saw substantial losses, triggering long liquidations as traders exited positions. The downturn follows Bitcoin's recent resilience, where it defied broader market declines, holding steady between $82,000 and $83,000 even as stocks and gold faltered, with analysts noting the cryptocurrency is often viewed by traders as a leading indicator of market sentiment. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $247 million in long liquidations, according to CoinGlass.

          <p>The Stay in LA campaign held a rally in Sun Valley, attended by industry workers and politicians, to advocate for measures boosting film and television production in Los Angeles. The campaign, which launched a petition signed by over 22,000 people, including Keanu Reeves and Olivia Wilde, is pushing for targeted incentives and the removal of tax incentive caps to combat runaway production. Despite the end of Hollywood labor strikes, filming in Los Angeles has dropped 30% over the past five years, with sound stage occupancy rates also declining. Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed doubling the state’s film and TV tax credit program to $750 million a year to compete with other states and countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has criticized the U.S. government's deportation of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to a dangerous prison in El Salvador as "wholly lawless," ordering the Trump administration to bring him back to the United States. Judge Paula Xinis stated there was little evidence to support allegations of Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation and that a previous immigration ruling barred his deportation to El Salvador due to potential persecution. The Justice Department has requested a pause on the ruling, while the White House described the deportation as an "administrative error," despite casting Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member. The case has also led to the suspension of a Justice Department attorney.</p>

          <p>A second child has died from measles as an outbreak of the virus continues to spread in western Texas, bringing the US case count to over 600 this year. The unvaccinated child, who had no underlying health conditions, died from complications of measles, prompting renewed calls for vaccination. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic, visited Texas and emphasized the importance of the MMR vaccine, as well as deploying a team to distribute vaccines and other support services. The outbreak, primarily affecting unvaccinated individuals, has raised concerns about the U.S. maintaining its measles elimination status.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office created in the 1960s to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions. The office, which does not have law enforcement authority, has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest, including after the Rodney King trial and the killing of George Floyd. Former leaders of the Community Relations Service worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide. Some staff may be reassigned to federal prosecutors' offices, a move some fear could cripple the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached a deal to resolve the dispute over proxy voting for new parents in the House of Representatives, ending a period of legislative paralysis. The agreement involves formalizing "vote pairing," allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member on the opposite side to offset the absence. In light of the deal, Luna will not trigger her bipartisan discharge petition to allow mothers and fathers to vote remotely for up to 12 weeks after childbirth. Johnson is also considering increasing accessibility for new mothers in Congress, such as adding a room off the House floor for nursing mothers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged the ongoing stock market sell-off, stating that while he doesn't want markets to decline, "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something." His comments came as U.S. stock futures dropped sharply, following losses from the previous week amid concerns over his proposed tariffs. Trump cited the trade deficit with China as the rationale for his tariffs plan, reiterating his willingness to deal with China if they address their surplus. The comments come after the president himself shared a link to a video on his Truth Social account, which claimed the president was causing the markets to plummet on purpose as part of his broader economic plans.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Chinese stocks, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The investment bank cut its 12-month growth estimate for the MSCI China Index to 10% from 16%, and for the CSI300 Index to 17% from 19%. The revision reflects a "high degree of uncertainty" surrounding the trade war and potential negotiations. The average earnings per share growth for Chinese stocks is now projected at 7%, down from 9%.

          <p>A minke whale that had been swimming in Long Beach Harbor for a week despite efforts to guide it back to deeper waters has died. The whale was found dead Sunday morning, and officials are conducting an examination to determine the cause of death, including whether it was affected by domoic acid. Minke whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and it remains a mystery why this particular whale wandered into the harbor. There are an estimated 900 minke whales off Oregon, Washington and California.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has appealed a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) decision to end funding for the state's Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Program. Newsom called the move "irrational and malicious," arguing it will harm both farmers and families who rely on food banks. The LFPA program, which began in 2022, provides grants to states and tribal governments to purchase food from local and socially disadvantaged farmers. The USDA's decision has left many farmers uncertain about their future, as the program provided a guaranteed income and supported food banks at a time of increasing food insecurity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stock futures opened sharply lower, indicating a continuation of the recent selloff triggered by the Trump administration's tariff announcement. Analysts attribute the market action to fear of a prolonged trade war and uncertainty about potential earnings declines. Some suggest the downturn could persist throughout the week, while others believe the market may find stability sooner. The Federal Reserve's decision to remain on hold until there is more clarity is also contributing to investor anxiety.

          <h2>Crude Oil Prices Plunge Amid Tariff-Fueled Recession Fears</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, amid concerns that President Trump's global tariffs will trigger a recession. Futures tied to West Texas Intermediate crude dropped more than 3%, following back-to-back 6% declines last week. The mounting worries stem from the potential for tariffs to increase prices for businesses, leading to an economic slowdown and reduced demand for oil.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that the Trump administration will remain committed to its reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners despite the global stock market sell-off. Lutnick emphasized that the tariffs are "coming" and that there is no consideration of postponing the start deadline. He argued that the president needs to reset global trade, citing the U.S. trade deficit. His comments echo those of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the administration is "going to hold the course" in imposing the tariffs.</p>

The child's death comes as an outbreak of measles originating in West Texas continues to spread. As of the latest CDC update on Friday, April 4, the U.S. has confirmed at least 607 measles cases so far this year, which is more than double the number of cases it saw in all of 2024.</p>
