        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, primarily due to declining sales at its Pizza Hut and KFC chains in the United States. Both brands saw a 5% drop in U.S. same-store sales as they faced intense competition and reduced consumer spending on dining out. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, with a 4% increase in same-store sales, reinforcing its position as the strongest performer in Yum's portfolio. The company's overall same-store sales grew by 2%, largely driven by strong international performance, particularly from KFC in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and better-than-expected second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The pharmaceutical giant's revenue was bolstered by strong sales from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, as well as other key drugs like Padcev and Eliquis. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, an increase from its previous forecast. This optimistic outlook comes as Pfizer navigates pressures from the Trump administration to lower drug prices and implements significant internal savings programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a hostile audience during a town hall meeting in Lincoln, where he was repeatedly heckled and booed while defending a major policy bill backed by President Trump. The crowd expressed strong opposition to the bill's provisions on healthcare and taxes, frequently interrupting the congressman with chants like "Tax the Rich!" and "vote him out!" Flood attempted to justify his vote by focusing on changes to Medicaid and claiming the legislation offered middle-class tax cuts, but his arguments were met with significant resistance. The event highlighted a deep division between the representative and many of his constituents over recent federal policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm a combined total of nearly £46 million for failures leading to the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse impacted approximately 300,000 investors who were unable to access their money. The FCA found that Woodford and his firm made inappropriate investment decisions, increasing the fund's holdings in hard-to-sell assets, which left it unable to meet redemption requests. Woodford has been personally fined nearly £6 million and banned from senior management roles, though both he and his firm are appealing the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency, NASA, is accelerating plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, a key step toward establishing a permanent human base on the lunar surface. The initiative is seen as a response to similar ambitions from China and Russia, with concerns that those nations could create exclusive zones on the Moon. While scientists agree that nuclear power is likely the most viable energy source for long-term lunar missions, the ambitious timeline is questioned due to recent NASA budget cuts. The project also raises geopolitical tensions, with some experts worried that the new space race prioritizes national interests over collaborative scientific exploration.</p>

          <p>A grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, has declined to indict former Atlanta police officer Kiran Kimbrough in the 2023 death of 62-year-old church deacon Johnny Hollman. Hollman died after a struggle with Kimbrough following a minor car accident, during which he was tased after refusing to sign a citation. Body camera footage showed Hollman repeatedly saying, "I can't breathe." While an autopsy ruled the death a homicide with heart disease as a contributing factor, the grand jury rejected charges of manslaughter and battery. The Hollman family expressed devastation at the decision, vowing to continue their fight for justice.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a limited injunction against a new Arkansas law that requires the public display of the Ten Commandments in every classroom and library. The ruling specifically prevents enforcement of the law in four school districts where families, represented by civil liberties groups, filed a lawsuit arguing it violates the constitutional separation of church and state. U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks criticized the law as part of a coordinated strategy to inject Christian doctrine into public schools. This decision is part of a larger legal battle over similar laws in other Republican-led states like Louisiana and Texas.</p>

          <p>A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reverse the Trump administration's termination of a $3 billion climate and environmental justice grant program. The lawsuit argues that canceling the program, which was established by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act, is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. The program was designed to fund community-led projects in disadvantaged areas to combat environmental hazards like pollution and flooding. This first-of-its-kind class action lawsuit aims to force the EPA to reinstate the grants for nearly 350 selected recipients across the country.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. jobs report for July, which showed a meager increase of 73,000 nonfarm payrolls, has intensified concerns that the American economy is slowing down significantly. Downward revisions for May and June brought the three-month average job gain to just 35,000, a fraction of last year's pace. Economists now see elevated risks of a recession, citing weak job growth and the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business investment. Despite President Trump's dismissal of the report, the data aligns with other indicators pointing to below-potential growth for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article delves into the complexities of labeling violent acts as "evil," using the case of Bryan Kohberger, convicted of the University of Idaho murders, as a starting point. The author questions whether the term "evil" serves as a way to avoid deeper understanding of the roots of violence, such as neurological disorders or environmental factors. Drawing parallels to other cases, including her own wrongful conviction, the author argues that focusing on the "why" behind such horrific crimes is crucial for prevention. Rather than seeking vengeance, society could benefit from viewing perpetrators as broken individuals, which might lead to more effective and compassionate solutions.</p>

Relatives of the nearly 132,000 people missing in Mexico continue to search for their loved ones amidst the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Israel's Gaza Aid Restriction Was a Moral and Strategic Failure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that Israel's policy of restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza was not only a moral catastrophe that induced a hunger crisis but also a major strategic blunder. The policy failed to weaken Hamas and instead handed the group leverage, while provoking international outrage that damaged Israel's key alliances, particularly with the United States. Global condemnation has led allies like the UK and Canada to support recognizing a Palestinian state, and has alienated both Democrats and some Republicans in the U.S. The article argues that Prime Minister Netanyahu pursued this self-defeating policy to appease far-right coalition partners essential for his political survival.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The state-owned oil giant reported an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still beat analyst expectations despite being the tenth consecutive quarter of declining profits. CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for the future, forecasting that oil demand in the second half of 2025 will be significantly higher. The company is also maintaining its capital expenditure guidance and focusing on increasing its natural gas production by over 60% by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's prolonged property market downturn may be approaching its end, according to analysts who point to stabilizing factors like renewed credit for developers and a shrinking inventory of unsold homes. Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast, now predicting a slower 7% decline in new home sales for the year, an improvement from its earlier 15% projection. A key factor in this potential recovery is the consolidation of the market, with large state-owned developers increasing their market share. This shift is seen as instrumental in bringing stability to a sector that has been in crisis since 2021. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent airdrops of aid into Gaza by several countries, humanitarian organizations and Palestinians on the ground report that these efforts are failing to alleviate the severe hunger crisis. The aid is described as insufficient, poorly distributed, and dangerous, with reports of at least one person being killed by a falling pallet. Groups like the UNRWA emphasize that airdrops are a costly and inefficient last resort compared to land-based deliveries through border crossings. German officials and others are urging Israel to fully open land routes to prevent mass starvation, as the current tactical pauses and limited corridors are not enough.</p>

Cooper advocated for greater transparency to provide communities with more information, while acknowledging that police must balance this with the need to ensure a fair trial.

The program is designed to deter visa overstays and applies to countries with high overstay rates or those with deficient screening processes. While the specific countries are not named, the move is consistent with the Trump administration's broader agenda to tighten immigration controls.

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to enter negotiations with federal agencies to resolve a freeze on approximately $339 million in research grants. The grants, crucial for medical and scientific research, were suspended by the Trump administration, which accused UCLA of civil rights violations related to antisemitism, admissions practices, and transgender athletes. While senior administrators expressed hope for a solution through dialogue, hundreds of faculty members have signed a petition urging the university to challenge the administration's demands more forcefully. The outcome of this situation is being closely watched by public universities nationwide.</p>
