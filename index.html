          <p>The Metropolitan Police are actively investigating media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he provided officers with her date of birth and social security number shortly before a photograph of their first meeting was published. This development follows calls for him to be stripped of his "prince" title, adding to the scrutiny surrounding his association with Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations made against him.</p>

          <p>An Ohio man was arrested after disrupting a Wikipedia conference in Manhattan by jumping on stage with a gun and threatening to take his own life. The 27-year-old man, who wore a sign identifying himself as a 'non-offending pedophile,' was tackled and disarmed by two conference attendees before police arrived. Their quick actions were praised for preventing any injuries during the chaotic incident. The conference was temporarily suspended but resumed the following day, while the suspect faces charges including criminal possession of a weapon.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of people participated in the second major 'No Kings' day of protest across the United States, demonstrating against the policies of the Trump administration. Organizers framed the events as a defense of democracy, with protesters raising concerns over immigration tactics, environmental protection rollbacks, and perceived authoritarian behavior. While some Republican leaders criticized the demonstrations as 'divisive' or a 'hate America rally,' the events in most cities were characterized by peaceful marching, song, and dance, with few arrests reported.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on 'credible reports' that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians within Gaza, which would constitute a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department has informed other guarantors of the peace deal, stating that such an act would undermine significant diplomatic progress. Hamas has denied the accusation, in turn blaming Israel for supporting rival armed gangs amid a power vacuum left by Israel's partial withdrawal. This escalation in rhetoric threatens the fragile stability established by the recent truce.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has reportedly caused a fire and damaged a workshop at the Orenburg gas processing plant, one of the world's largest such facilities, according to the regional governor in Russia. The attack, which caused no injuries, marks a significant strike in Ukraine's ongoing campaign targeting Russian energy infrastructure. This strategy aims to disrupt fuel supplies and reduce Moscow's revenue for its war effort. In a separate incident, Russian air defenses were also active over the Samara region, another area with key energy facilities.</p>

          <p>Several large companies, including Accenture and Lufthansa, have recently announced significant job cuts, citing the integration of artificial intelligence as a primary reason for restructuring. However, some industry experts and critics are skeptical, suggesting that AI has become a 'good excuse' for layoffs that may actually be driven by other factors, such as over-hiring during the pandemic or general economic slowdowns. Research from institutions like Yale and the New York Fed indicates that widespread, AI-driven job displacement has not yet materialized, and many firms are using AI to retrain existing employees rather than replace them.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-long investigation, aided by secret filming from the BBC, has culminated in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud in the UK. The scheme, operated by a company called Sell My Timeshare, targeted over 3,500 predominantly elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts. Using high-pressure 'bait-and-switch' tactics, the fraudsters took victims' money for useless 'credits' while funding lavish lifestyles. The successful prosecution represents a major victory for the victims and law enforcement.</p>

His absence is being felt in the team's inability to effectively build play from the back against high-pressing opponents and in a sharp decrease in long, switching passes that disrupt defensive shapes.

          <h2>UK Forests Threatened by Climate Change, Experts Propose New Tree Species</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom's native trees, including iconic species like oak, are under significant stress from rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events. In response, Forestry England has developed a 'species for the future' list, identifying 30 types of trees, including non-native ones like the Corsican pine and coast redwood, that are better suited to thrive in the UK's projected warmer climate. This strategy of 'assisted migration' aims to build more resilient, diverse forests capable of adapting to the rapid environmental changes.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old woman is facing eviction from her cottage on the West Horsley Place estate, which famously served as the filming location for the BBC sitcom 'Ghosts.' Baschea Walsh, who has lived in the home for nearly two decades, was informed by the charitable trust that owns the property that it intends to convert her home into a holiday rental for fans of the show. The decision has left the long-time resident, an active member of the local community, in a state of crisis and uncertain about her future.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced a plan to develop a 'T-Dome,' a sophisticated, multilayered air defense network designed to protect the island from potential missile and drone attacks by mainland China. The proposal, seemingly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome system, would utilize advanced technologies including artificial intelligence. However, the announcement caught Taiwan's defense establishment by surprise, as the project was not mentioned in recent defense reports and has no funding allocated in the upcoming government budget.</p>

          <h2>Reports Indicate Japanese Coalition Deal Could Appoint First Female Prime Minister</h2>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is reportedly set to form a coalition with the opposition Japan Innovation Party, a move that would likely make LDP leader Sanae Takaichi the nation's first female Prime Minister. This political alliance is expected to bring stability after the LDP's long-standing junior coalition partner, Komeito, departed the government, throwing Takaichi's path to the premiership into uncertainty. The formal agreement is anticipated to be signed on Monday, paving the way for a historic leadership change in Japanese politics.</p>
