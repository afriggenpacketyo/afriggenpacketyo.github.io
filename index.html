          <p>In a landmark partnership, Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI to construct a series of advanced AI data centers. This investment will grant OpenAI access to millions of Nvidia's critical graphics processing units, which are essential for building the computational infrastructure required for future AI breakthroughs. The ambitious project aims to deploy 10 gigawatts of power across multiple new facilities, with the first data center scheduled to become operational in the latter half of 2026. This deal underscores Nvidia's pivotal role in the AI industry and addresses the massive, unmet demand for AI computing power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Trump declared that he believes Ukraine is positioned to win back all of its territory from Russia. This new stance, announced on social media after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede land for peace. Trump asserted that Russia is facing severe economic trouble and appears to be a "paper tiger," creating a strategic opportunity for Ukraine to act decisively. The article also notes other administrative news, including a new probe into White House border czar Tom Homan.</p>

          <p>During his address at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump delivered a harsh critique of European nations for their immigration policies. He contended that a large influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East is destroying their countries and cultural heritage, urging them to adopt a more restrictive stance. Trump drew parallels to the U.S. border situation under the previous administration, reinforcing his administration's focus on national sovereignty and mass deportations. He argued that all countries have a right to defend their citizens and reject policies that strain social safety nets.</p>

The 29-year-old, who was partnered with professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin, stated she "landed funny" while training, and a subsequent MRI scan confirmed the fracture. Dyer expressed her deep disappointment over having to leave the show, as her participation was cut short after the pre-recorded launch episode had already aired. She is the second celebrity contestant to withdraw from this year's series before the first week of live competition.</p>

          <p>Micron Technology reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by the sustained boom in the artificial intelligence sector. The company's revenue saw a remarkable 46% year-over-year increase, reaching $11.32 billion, and it issued a strong sales forecast for the upcoming quarter. As a leading U.S.-based manufacturer of memory chips, Micron is benefiting from the high demand for its high-bandwidth memory, a crucial component in advanced AI processors.

          <p>U.S. consumers are rushing to dealerships to buy electric vehicles before federal tax credits of up to $7,500 expire on September 30. These credits, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out under President Trump's new policies, which has triggered a record surge in EV sales. In response, dealerships are offering their own significant incentives to clear out inventory ahead of new models, with some monthly lease rates dropping dramatically. While this deadline is creating a temporary sales boom, industry experts are concerned about a potential sharp decline in demand once the financial incentives are no longer available.</p>

The child was tragically killed when a vehicle was swept away by floodwaters in Barstow, an incident in which his father was also injured.

          <p>President Trump's recent emphatic warnings for pregnant women and children to avoid Tylenol (acetaminophen) have ignited public confusion and a debate over its potential connection to autism. While some observational studies have suggested an association between the drug's use during pregnancy and a higher likelihood of autism or ADHD diagnoses in children, the scientific evidence remains inconclusive and highly contested. A major 2024 Swedish study found that the link disappeared after controlling for genetic and environmental factors.

For a representative $40,000 loan with a 15-year term, the average monthly cost is now approximately $389, a decrease from about $394 earlier in the year. While this reduction offers some financial relief, the savings are relatively modest, leading borrowers to weigh the benefits of securing a loan now against the possibility of further rate cuts later this year.

He also issued a stern warning to Russia regarding its war in Ukraine, calling the nation a "paper tiger."

It argues that while Carr suggested the FCC could revoke broadcast licenses, historical precedent and First Amendment protections make such an action highly improbable. The true leverage, the article posits, is not in license revocation but in the FCC's regulatory authority over media mergers and acquisitions. By creating a hostile environment, the chair can implicitly pressure companies with business before the FCC to comply with political demands, effectively chilling free speech through regulatory intimidation.</p>

While many Antifa activists participate in non-violent protests and research, some militant factions do advocate for and use violence, which sparks both internal debate and public criticism.

          <p>Police in Beverly Hills are investigating a hate crime after a man was recorded on surveillance footage drawing a swastika on the sidewalk directly outside an elementary school. The hateful symbol was discovered on Monday, which marked the start of the Jewish high holiday of Rosh Hashanah. School district officials swiftly condemned the antisemitic act, stating that "hate of any kind is not acceptable" and reaffirming their commitment to ensuring student safety. The incident has led to increased police patrols around Jewish community centers and places of worship throughout the Los Angeles area.</p>

          <p>Leading health organizations worldwide, including the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization, are forcefully rejecting President Trump's recent claims of a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) and autism. In public statements, officials emphasized that there is no consistent scientific evidence to support this assertion and that the medication remains a safe and vital option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. The U.K.'s health secretary urged the public to disregard the president's medical advice, highlighting that the risks associated with untreated fever during pregnancy are well-established. This global scientific consensus aims to counter misinformation and reassure the public.</p>

          <p>England's newly announced squad for the upcoming Ashes cricket tour in Australia is being recognized as its most aggressive and fast-paced in generations. The bowling lineup, which includes formidable pacers like Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, represents a strategic shift designed to counter Australia's powerful batting on their home turf. This move away from the style of bowlers England has traditionally taken to Australia is seen as a bold new approach. However, significant concerns persist regarding the injury history of several key bowlers and the overall fitness of captain Ben Stokes, whose presence is critical for success.</p>

          <p>The monumental $100 billion partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI was finalized through a series of rapid, high-stakes negotiations that concluded just hours before its public announcement. The deal, which involves Nvidia investing in OpenAI and supplying essential chips for new AI supercomputing facilities, was primarily brokered directly between CEOs Jensen Huang and Sam Altman without the involvement of investment bankers. This arrangement places the two companies at the epicenter of the AI boom but also creates complex dynamics with other key partners like Microsoft, which was reportedly informed only a day before the deal was officially signed.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, will be tried for all seven alleged murders in a single, consolidated proceeding. Heuermann's defense team had filed a motion to sever the cases, arguing that there were significant disparities in the evidence across the killings, which span nearly two decades. However, the judge denied this request and also ruled against a separate defense challenge to the admissibility of the advanced DNA evidence that was crucial to the investigation. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Florida has convicted Ryan Routh of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his golf course in September 2024. Routh, who chose to represent himself during the trial, was found guilty on all five charges, including weapons violations, and now faces a potential life sentence in prison. In a dramatic scene following the verdict's announcement, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before being quickly subdued by U.S. Marshals. Prosecutors successfully argued that although no shot was fired, Routh had clear intent and took substantial steps to carry out the attack.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will officially implement an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) System, commonly known as "robot umpires," beginning with the 2026 season. The new technology will not replace human umpires entirely but will be integrated through a challenge system, allowing each team to appeal two ball or strike calls per game. If a challenge is successful, the team will retain it for later use. This system, which has been extensively tested in the minor leagues since 2019, is expected to significantly improve call accuracy and reduce on-field arguments and ejections.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has forcefully defended the central bank's independence from political influence, particularly from the Trump administration. Without mentioning the president by name, Powell dismissed claims that the Fed's monetary policy decisions are politically motivated as a "cheap shot," and he reiterated that policy is guided solely by economic data. His remarks come during an ongoing campaign by President Trump to exert more control over the Fed, which has included attempts to install political loyalists on its board and public demands for specific interest rate actions. Powell's direct rebuttal highlights the intense struggle over the institution's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Infections caused by highly drug-resistant bacteria have surged by nearly 70% in the United States between 2019 and 2023, according to a new and concerning report from CDC scientists. This increase is primarily driven by bacteria that carry the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most available antibiotics, including the last-resort class of drugs known as carbapenems. Researchers warn that this trend, likely worsened by the overuse of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a "grave danger" to public health. The spread could make once-common infections, such as urinary tract infections, far more difficult to treat.</p>
