          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan office building, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, left a note suggesting a grievance with the NFL, whose offices are in the building, related to a perceived head injury. The attack involved a high-powered rifle, and the victims included employees of Blackstone and Rudin Management, as well as a security guard. The incident has prompted widespread condemnation from city officials and renewed calls for stricter national gun control measures.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will formally recognize a Palestinian state by the United Nations General Assembly in September unless specific conditions are met by Israel. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the move is intended to preserve the viability of a two-state solution. The conditions for Israel include agreeing to a ceasefire, allowing substantial humanitarian aid into Gaza, and ceasing annexations in the West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the announcement, stating that it rewards Hamas and undermines efforts to release hostages.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has reintroduced Tasmanian devils to its exhibits for the first time in five years, welcoming two males named Danny Zuko and Crush. The animals, indigenous only to the island of Tasmania, arrived from the Aussie Ark conservation organization in Australia. Known for having the strongest bite relative to their body size of any mammal, they are classified as an endangered species. Their population is primarily threatened by a contagious cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease, as well as conflicts with humans and other predators.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy who died from a rare brain-eating amoeba infection, are advocating for greater public awareness of the risks associated with swimming in freshwater. The infection, primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), occurs when the Naegleria fowleri organism enters the brain through the nose, which happened after Jaysen swam in Lake Murray, South Carolina. His family emphasized that they were unaware of the danger and hope that sharing their story will prevent similar tragedies. This was the first known case in the state since 2016, prompting health officials to reiterate safety precautions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has initiated a process to draft a rule that would ban law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from obscuring their identities with masks or gaiters. The motion follows numerous reports of armed federal agents in unmarked vans conducting raids while concealing their faces. Proponents argue the practice is intimidating and a violation of civil rights, while the Department of Homeland Security claims it is necessary to protect officers from being targeted. The county's legal authority to enforce such a ban on federal agents is questionable and likely faces a legal challenge.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, a move that would dismantle the legal basis for most federal climate regulations. This action targets rules for vehicle emissions and power plants, aligning with the Trump administration's agenda to reverse climate policies. While environmental advocates condemned the proposal as dangerous, some experts suggest it could inadvertently strengthen California's ability to enforce its own stricter standards. California officials have affirmed their commitment to continuing their climate initiatives, potentially setting up a significant legal and regulatory battle.</p>

A Wall Street Journal poll shows that over half of Americans oppose the latest Republican-led tax cut bill, a sentiment consistent with the unpopularity of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. This trend may be driven by several factors, including a lower overall tax burden compared to past decades, rising income inequality, and growing public concern over the national debt. While voters are souring on cuts, especially those perceived to benefit the wealthy, they have not shown an appetite for broad tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Closer Look at Nevada's Gun Laws Following Manhattan Shooting by Las Vegas Resident</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 18:06:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The mass shooting in Manhattan, carried out by a Las Vegas resident, has brought attention to Nevada's gun laws. The gunman legally purchased a revolver and held a concealed carry permit in the state, which is an open carry state for adults over 18. Since a 2017 mass shooting, Nevada has implemented stricter measures, including universal background checks for private firearm sales and a "red flag" law allowing temporary removal of guns from individuals deemed a danger. However, the state does not ban assault-style weapons like the one used in the New York attack.</p>

          <h2>Security Camera System Reportedly Flagged Manhattan Gunman as a Threat Before Attack</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 18:04:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to former federal officials, the security camera system at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan identified the gunman as a potential threat moments before he entered the building and began his deadly attack. A still image from surveillance footage reportedly shows the suspect with a rifle, highlighted by a computer-generated box, indicating that threat-detection software had flagged him for immediate attention. This new information raises questions about the building's security response and whether the tragedy could have been mitigated. The building's management company declined to comment on the system or the actions taken by its security staff.</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Marcus Morris Sr. was denied bond in a Florida court following his arrest on felony fraud charges originating from Nevada. The charges stem from two warrants related to allegedly unpaid casino markers totaling over $200,000. During the hearing, the prosecutor stated that Nevada is seeking extradition but might consider dismissing the charges if the debt is paid in full. An attorney for Morris indicated that a large payment had already been wired in an effort to resolve the matter. Morris earned over $100 million during his 11-year NBA career.</p>

          <p>Senator Cory Booker engaged in a heated debate with fellow Democrats on the Senate floor, accusing them of being "complicit" in President Trump's agenda by advancing a bipartisan policing package. Booker objected to the legislation, arguing it failed to address the Justice Department's politicization of federal grants, which he claims are being withheld from jurisdictions that oppose Trump. He insisted that Democrats should use their leverage to fight against what he called unconstitutional actions rather than comply. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Amy Klobuchar defended the package, criticizing Booker for not raising his concerns earlier in the committee process.</p>

Niccol highlighted rising employee engagement and customer connection scores as positive signs. The company is focusing on its "Green Apron Service" hospitality program and improving its cafes, while also seeing a return to same-store sales growth in its key China market.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his falling out with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was because Epstein hired away young female employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking to reporters, Trump suggested that Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser, was one of the spa workers who was "stolen" from his staff. This account contrasts with previous White House statements that Trump banned Epstein from the club for being a "creep." The claim also raises questions about the timeline, as Giuffre was reportedly hired away in 2000, yet Trump spoke highly of Epstein in a 2002 interview.</p>

          <p>Data from Los Angeles County shows that July is the deadliest month for drug overdoses, and public health experts suggest a strong link to extreme heat. Opioids can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature and cause sedation, preventing users from seeking shade or help, while stimulants like methamphetamine can lead to overexertion in hot conditions. Despite evidence, official death records often undercount heat as a contributing factor due to inconsistent certification protocols. Experts in other regions, like Arizona, have implemented more systematic tracking, revealing a much higher number of heat-related deaths and highlighting a need for better data.</p>

The administration's approach aims to shift focus from housing-first policies to addressing what it calls the root causes of homelessness. However, critics and housing advocates are concerned that the order could undermine established strategies and violate the rights of people living on the streets. The new policy signals a fundamental change in how the federal government approaches the issue, prioritizing treatment and intervention over immediate housing solutions.</p>
