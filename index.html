          <p>President Trump claimed that China has violated its trade agreement with the U.S., casting doubt on the accord's stability. This accusation follows concerns voiced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about stalled U.S.-China trade talks. The initial trade agreement had reduced tariffs, boosting the stock market and easing recession fears, but a court ruling recently challenged the legal basis for some tariffs. Trump's remarks and the legal uncertainty have contributed to slight declines in U.S. stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend of higher-tier seating is gaining traction, with Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa also offering premium suites.

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs is being hailed as a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited tariff authority. This decision reinforces the principle that the power to impose taxes, including tariffs, rests with Congress, preventing the executive branch from wielding monarchical powers and initiating trade wars.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up last year, overcoming a moment of overconfidence during the competition. Despite nearly misstepping on the word "commelina," Zaki recovered to correctly spell "eclaircissement" for the victory. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki's win marks the 30th time in the past 36 years that an Indian American has claimed the title. Zaki plans to donate a large portion of his winnings to charity.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of hiring managers indicates that while a master's degree may not necessarily translate to better job performance compared to candidates with a bachelor's degree and experience, it still commands a higher salary. Despite 62% of hiring managers believing that master's degree holders perform the same or worse, 72% would offer higher salaries to candidates with a master's. This is attributed to the perceived symbolic value of advanced degrees, although skills-based hiring is becoming increasingly common.</p>
