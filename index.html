          <p>President Trump is on a four-day tour through the Gulf, including stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, aiming to secure deals worth over $1 trillion. The New York Times article reports that these deals are expected to involve investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. The trip has raised ethical concerns due to the Trump family's pending business deals with Saudi-owned real estate firms, a cryptocurrency venture with an Emirati affiliate, and a golf project backed by Qatar. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family as a donation to his presidential library, raising further ethical questions.</p>

The results were not favorable for Marcos, with only six of his alliance's senatorial picks winning, potentially weakening his administration and casting doubt on efforts to impeach Duterte. The deteriorating relationship stems from the impeachment efforts against Duterte and criminal charges filed against her, setting the stage for a turbulent year in Philippine politics. </p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with the terror probe into a fire at Prime Minister Keir Starmer's home, while also covering his government's new immigration policy. The Daily Telegraph features close-up photos of the damage, and The Daily Mirror interviews neighbors about the "mystery blaze." The Daily Express questions Starmer's immigration policy, while The Guardian reports backlash from MPs who say his comments echo far-right rhetoric. The Financial Times leads with the U.S. and China agreeing to a ceasefire in their trade war, slashing tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days. </p>

          <p>Former professional cricketer Arul Suppiah speaks about his battle with anorexia, a serious mental health condition often associated with young women, but which affected him in his 30s. What began as a health kick in 2017 escalated into excessive exercise and restrictive eating, leading to significant weight loss and social avoidance. After nearly fainting at work, Suppiah sought help following a doctor's warning and family discussions. He recalls a psychiatrist threatening hospitalization under the Mental Health Act if he didn't improve, which motivated him to turn things around. </p>

          <p>For the third time, Scottish MSPs are set to vote on plans to legalize assisted dying, allowing terminally-ill adults to seek medical assistance to end their lives.

Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, who introduced the bill, says it includes strict eligibility criteria and safeguards.

Chinese entrepreneurs and investors express optimism about technological advancements but remain less optimistic about the broader economy.
