          <p>A Frankfurt court is set to rule in the case of a Syrian doctor, Alaa M., accused of committing crimes against humanity in Syrian military hospitals between 2011 and 2012. He is accused of torturing and murdering prisoners under Bashar Assad's regime, including allegations of setting a teenage boy's genitals on fire. Alaa M. denies the charges, claiming he feared the military police. Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence, while the defense is pushing for acquittal, in a trial held under the principle of "universal jurisdiction," allowing prosecution of serious crimes committed abroad.</p>

ICE agents conducted a raid at a Santa Fe Springs swap meet, leading to the postponement of a scheduled concert, and witnesses reported that many people were detained. Trump recently acknowledged that some undocumented immigrants provide essential services, particularly in agriculture and hospitality, prompting skepticism from union leaders about the administration's leniency towards rural workers.</p>

The article details incidents where Israeli forces shot and killed civilians seeking food, including a 12-year-old boy's mother, highlighting the desperation and lack of dignity in the aid process. The author contrasts this with the structured and humane aid system previously run by UNRWA, where aid was distributed fairly and with respect, emphasizing the current famine and the struggle for survival in Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study forecasts that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of the century, affecting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. The research, based on 160 years of data, indicates that warmer temperatures cause upstream ice to break apart and accumulate in colder downstream areas, leading to destructive flooding. These localized hazards can damage communities, wildlife, and infrastructure, increasing the risk of devastating floods along the Yellow River, known as "China's Sorrow" for its history of such disasters.</p>

The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group recently conducted maritime security operations in the South China Sea as part of the U.S. Navy's routine presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and its current trajectory suggests a move towards the Middle East, where conflict between Israel and Iran is escalating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be transported to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a shortage of incinerators to handle the extra demand, and while the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the short-term impact will be a rise in emissions from transporting the waste. Environmental groups are concerned that contracts guaranteeing waste delivery to incinerators will discourage investment in recycling, as domestic recycling rates have barely improved in a decade.</p>

The ongoing conflict is viewed as a way for Prime Minister Netanyahu to bolster his political career, but it risks further destabilizing the region and undermining Israel's long-term security.</p>

          <p>Japan has requested eight countries and regions to block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, as gambling with overseas-based betting sites is a crime in Japan. The government is urging operators to cut off access to their sites, many of which are provided in Japanese, and is cracking down on illegal gambling following media revelations of online casino use by athletes and celebrities. The request has been made to Canada, Costa Rica, Georgia, Malta, Anjouan Island in the Comoros, Curacao of the Netherlands, and the Isle of Man and Gibraltar.</p>
