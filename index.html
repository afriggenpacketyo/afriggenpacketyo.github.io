          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with Rwanda to establish an agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including non-Rwandan nationals. Secretary of State Marco Rubio mentioned actively seeking countries to take in migrants expelled from the U.S., emphasizing the desire for them to be "further away from America." Rwanda's experience with handling deportees, including a past deal with the United Kingdom, is cited as a factor. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to find third countries to manage migrants and deportees, raising concerns about human rights and international relations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked its enforcement. The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing clients disliked by the president, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. The ruling marks a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's use of government power for retribution. The judge emphasized the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to defend constitutional rights without fear of reprisal.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man, Tim Friede, who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an "unparalleled" antivenom, according to scientists. Antibodies in Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. This could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites, which kill up to 14,000 people a year. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, creating an antivenom cocktail that showed impressive protection in mice.</p>

The center-right Liberal-National Coalition's support has declined since Trump took office, and they now trail the Labor Party. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign echoed Trump's messaging, but this strategy appears to have backfired due to Trump's unpopularity in Australia.

          <p>President Trump's family's net worth has reportedly increased by $2.9 billion due to investments in crypto products, coinciding with his administration's loosening of regulations in the digital currency industry. A report estimates that Trump's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth, driven by meme coins and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. The article raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the lack of transparency surrounding these investments, especially as the SEC has paused investigations into crypto companies.</p>
