        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry over nine years to support security-related technology research. This funding has become increasingly important due to declining operational subsidies for national universities and a decreasing student population. While the ministry's program helps fund state-of-the-art projects, such as gas-absorbing sheets and AI cyberattack detection systems, it has faced criticism over potential military applications and the ministry's influence on research priorities. The program's budget has steadily increased since its inception, reflecting the government's growing emphasis on defense capabilities. Optimism is muted due to the sensitive nature of defense-related research. </p>

          <p>Over 1,100 migrants crossed the English Channel into the UK on Saturday, marking the highest single-day total in 2025. The increasing number of crossings has prompted concern from officials, including Defence Secretary John Healey, who described the situation as "shocking". Home Office figures indicate a significant rise in crossings compared to previous years, with the annual total already exceeding figures from the same period in 2023 and 2024.

          <p>North Korea amended its space development law in 2022, removing the ban on the military use of space for national defense purposes, according to analysis by 38 North. The revised law now includes a warning about countermeasures against countries engaging in unfriendly acts. This change aligns with North Korea's claim of successfully placing a reconnaissance satellite into orbit in 2023. The shift suggests a maturing space strategy focused on actively promoting its presence in space, reflecting broader geopolitical trends among major powers. </p>

The administration has taken actions such as halting Harvard's ability to enroll international students and ordering federal agencies to cancel contracts with the school.

While online options exist, the tactile experience of crafting is often lost, potentially discouraging new crafters. The disappearance of these stores also reduces opportunities for community building and the preservation of crafting traditions. Crafting has a significant place in American history, from the homespun movement to the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and its decline could impact cultural expression and social connection. </p>

The author cites the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The Johnnie Tillmon model, which emphasizes uniting the poor across differences and building visionary projects of survival, is presented as a relevant strategy for today.
