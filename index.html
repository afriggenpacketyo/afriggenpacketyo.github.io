Columnists express concerns about a potential "century of humiliation" for Europe, drawing parallels to China's historical experiences with colonial powers. The article highlights the growing anxieties and geopolitical subservience felt across the continent. The article suggests the pressures from global powers and internal struggles could significantly impact Europe's future stability and influence. Optimism is low as the continent navigates these complex and potentially destabilizing circumstances.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra left Thailand abruptly ahead of a Supreme Court ruling that could lead to his imprisonment. His departure occurred hours before a parliamentary vote for the next prime minister, following his daughter's removal from office. Thaksin claimed he was traveling to Singapore for medical reasons, but his jet diverted to Dubai, where he previously lived in exile. The Pheu Thai coalition, linked to the Shinawatra family, has faced political challenges, including the removal of Thaksin's daughter from her Prime Minister position. The political instability has positioned Anutin Charnvirakul as the frontrunner in the upcoming vote.</p>

          <p>President Javier Milei is focusing on unlocking Argentina's copper potential to capitalize on increasing global demand for electrification and renewable energy. Milei's administration hopes the mining sector can play a key role in stabilizing the economy. The Large Investment Incentive Regime aims to attract large-scale investors with tax, trade, and foreign exchange benefits. Companies like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto are investing in Argentina's copper and lithium potential. While Argentina faces policy consistency and social license challenges, analysts estimate the copper projects could represent a $47 billion opportunity for the economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 in a wild NFL season opener that included a lightning delay and an ejection. Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns, and Saquon Barkley added another, leading the Eagles to an early lead. However, Jalen Carter was ejected for spitting on Dak Prescott, shifting the game's momentum. The game was delayed for 65 minutes due to lightning, and neither team scored after the resumption. Despite undisciplined moments and penalties, the Eagles' defense held strong, securing the victory.</p>

Sir Tony praised the Western allies' "coalition of the willing" discussing post-war Ukraine, viewing it as a broader effort for European security. He also commended former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sir Tony urged "scepticism" against arguments of a new non-NATO "axis" forming.</p>

The case could lead the Supreme Court to reconsider a 1935 decision that presidents cannot fire independent board members without cause.

The attorneys would help with the backlog of cases "by presiding over immigration hearings" at the request of the Justice Department. The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases. The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan, stating that immigration law is different and exceptionally complex.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates a surge in demand for AI skills, with employers willing to pay premium salaries for jobs requiring them. Job postings mentioning at least one AI skill advertised salaries 28% higher than those without, representing roughly $18,000 more per year. The study identified over 300 AI skills ranging from AI ethics to machine learning. Basic skills like proficiency in ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot are becoming more prevalent and accessible.

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, was convicted of murder in the killing of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel was gunned down in 2014 amid a bitter custody battle with Adelson's daughter. Prosecutors argued that Adelson orchestrated Markel's killing after he stood in the way of letting her daughter and grandchildren move south. Adelson exclaimed, "Oh!" and started shaking and crying when the judge announced the verdict. She was the fifth person put on trial for the murder-for-hire plot.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. The change would return the department to a name it carried for much of its history, until 1949. Under the executive order, the name "Department of War" will serve as a "secondary title" for the Department of Defense. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge the change in a post on social media on Thursday, writing simply, "DEPARTMENT OF WAR."</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War is a misguided and cringeworthy move. The author contends that the change reflects Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's obsession with appearing tough and warlike. The Department of Defense was created in 1947 to address a new, more dangerous world that required a larger military organization than any in American history. The author argues that Trump and Hegseth are out of touch with the realities of modern national security.</p>
