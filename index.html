            <p>Former President Donald Trump voiced hope for a potential deal between Russia and Ukraine following the end of a temporary Easter ceasefire, suggesting it could lead to lucrative business opportunities for the United States. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of violating the ceasefire agreement thousands of times, casting doubt on Russia's intentions. Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick echoed Zelenskyy's skepticism, highlighting Vladimir Putin's history of unreliability, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio is trying to barter a just and fair agreement. Trump also mentioned an upcoming minerals deal with Ukraine, hinting at easing U.S. demands for aid repayment. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>Max Verstappen addressed the penalty he received during the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, hinting at undisclosed reasons for his silence. The penalty stemmed from cutting a chicane after the start, which stewards deemed a violation of driving standards, awarding Oscar Piastri the corner. Piastri ultimately won the race after Verstappen served his penalty, with McLaren's team principal affirming the decision's clarity. Verstappen's team principal Christian Horner said he felt the penalty was "very harsh". Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>Manchester United suffered another defeat, raising concerns about their goal-scoring ability and overall performance under manager Ruben Amorim. The team's reliance on Rasmus Hojlund, who has struggled to consistently find the net, has been a point of concern, though Amorim vows to keep working with him. Amorim acknowledges the team's shortcomings and the need for improvement, with their season hinging on the Europa League campaign.

He emphasized the importance of upholding Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights, arguing that their violation threatens the rights of all Americans.

            <p>Lewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as "horrible," citing a lack of pace and an inability to feel the car. He finished seventh, significantly behind his teammate Charles Leclerc, who secured a podium finish. Hamilton expressed uncertainty about the cause of his struggles and anticipated similar challenges at the upcoming race in Miami. He acknowledged that there is no fix at the moment so this is how it's going to be for the rest or the year. Optimism score: 30</p>

In the Dodgers’ 1-0 win against the Texas Rangers, it proved to be the right-hander’s last one of the day. Though the Dodgers salvaged a series win at Globe Life Field, riding a stout bullpen and eighth-inning sacrifice fly from Freddie Freeman to victory in the series rubber-match, they first had to overcome yet another injury concern from Glasnow, who left the game after just four innings with what he later said was cramping in both his legs.

            <p>Solicitor General John Sauer responded to the Supreme Court's temporary halt on deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, calling the order "unprecedented" and wrong. Sauer argued that the detainees have no standing to seek an injunction since the government has paused their deportations. He implored the justices to limit the order to only a pause on AEA removals, not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members. No lower court has weighed in on the facts of the government's "notice" and "opportunity to appeal" process implemented in the wake of the SCOTUS order last month. Optimism score: 30</p>
