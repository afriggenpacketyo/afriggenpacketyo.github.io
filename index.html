          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated trade tensions by imposing an additional 25% tariff on India, bringing the total levies to 50% on imported Indian goods. This punitive measure, effective in 21 days, directly targets India's continued purchase of Russian Federation oil, which Trump views as fueling the war in Ukraine. India's Ministry of External Affairs strongly condemned the tariffs as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," asserting their imports are based on market factors and are vital for the energy security of its 1.4 billion people, while also noting other nations' trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are encountering significant new obstacles, stemming from recent administrative changes. A Trump executive order aims to restrict eligibility for employees of organizations deemed involved in "illegal immigration" or "disruption of public order," creating uncertainty. Furthermore, the defunct SAVE plan has led to a backlog of over 1.5 million applications for new repayment plans, while the PSLF Buyback program also faces delays, preventing borrowers from retroactively paying for missed months. Experts advise borrowers to maintain their current course, as the changes cannot be retroactive. This article discusses governmental financial regulation and contains data.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the medical journal JAMA estimates that the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year contributed to approximately 440 additional deaths beyond the official count of 31. Researchers suggest these excess fatalities likely resulted from increased exposure to poor air quality, which can exacerbate heart and lung conditions, and disruptions in access to essential healthcare services during the disaster. The findings underscore the critical need for improved mortality surveillance and alternative methods to quantify the broader health burden of climate-related emergencies, including long-term impacts observed in other wildfire-affected areas like Maui.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is reportedly scheduled to host a meeting with top Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, to discuss their strategy regarding the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal. A key agenda item is the potential public release of the Justice Department's recent interview transcript with Ghislaine Maxwell, who has offered to testify before Congress if granted a pardon. The administration faces mounting bipartisan pressure for transparency concerning Epstein-related files, with the House oversight committee issuing subpoenas to several high-profile figures.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held a three-hour "useful and constructive" meeting in Moscow, with President Trump subsequently declaring "great progress" on the Ukraine conflict. Despite the positive assessment, the White House still intends to implement secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners by Friday if a ceasefire is not reached. The talks occurred amidst escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas, including a recent strike in Zaporizhzhia, highlighting the ongoing war and the complex diplomatic efforts to end the three-year conflict.</p>

          <p>The Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir, has reportedly warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full occupation of the Gaza Strip, cautioning it would be like "walking into a trap" and could endanger remaining hostages. While the Defense Minister affirmed the military's commitment to executing government decisions, opposition leader Yair Lapid also opposes a full takeover, citing operational, moral, and economic concerns. Gaza remains devastated by nearly two years of conflict, facing a severe humanitarian crisis, as ceasefire negotiations continue to yield no results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat of sweeping secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia, including India, China, and the EU, could significantly disrupt the global economy. These tariffs, potentially reaching 100% import taxes, are designed to cut off Russia's oil and gas revenues, which finance its war in Ukraine. Experts warn of increased energy prices, higher consumer costs for goods like iPhones, and potential derailment of trade talks with China. The measures, while aiming to pressure Moscow, risk adding to inflationary pressures and causing significant economic hardship for affected nations.

          <p>Over 50 Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives have fled the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-backed redistricting plan, which President Trump seeks to enact before the 2026 midterm elections.

          <p>Italy has given final approval to the controversial €13.5 billion Messina Bridge project, set to become the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily to the mainland. The 3.3-kilometer structure is designed to withstand earthquakes, a critical consideration for its seismically active location. Proponents, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, champion the project as a vital investment for economic growth and job creation in Italy's impoverished southern regions. However, the plan continues to face significant opposition due to environmental concerns, high costs, and historical fears of potential mafia infiltration, requiring further environmental and legal clearances.</p>
