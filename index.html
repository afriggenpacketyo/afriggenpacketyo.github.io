          <p>Approximately 100 protestors gathered in Charlbury, an English village in the Cotswolds, to demonstrate against the presence of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who is on a private holiday in the area. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, the "Dance against Vance" event featured placards criticizing his political stances, particularly on Ukraine and environmental policies. Residents and attendees expressed that Vance's brand of politics is not welcome in their community, highlighting local disruption from the high-security presence and a broader sentiment against powerful figures using the area as a retreat.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to join European leaders for a virtual call with U.S. President Donald Trump to reinforce their position ahead of Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. The primary message is that no decisions about Ukraine's future, particularly concerning its borders, should be made without Kyiv's involvement. This comes as Trump has suggested a peace deal could involve territorial swaps, a notion Zelensky has firmly rejected, stating it could serve as a pretext for future Russian aggression. The call aims to present a united front and pressure Trump to align with Ukrainian and European interests.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed and is projected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane. As of late Tuesday, the storm was located in the eastern Atlantic and moving west, with forecasters anticipating it will become a hurricane by late Thursday. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, early models suggest it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands by the end of the week. The storm has already caused flooding and at least eight fatalities in the Cabo Verde islands off the African coast.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, an American destroyer, for allegedly entering its territorial waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal without permission. Beijing accused the U.S. of seriously infringing on its sovereignty and undermining regional stability. In response, the U.S. Seventh Fleet called China's statement false, clarifying that the USS Higgins was conducting a routine freedom of navigation operation in accordance with international law. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions in the region, where China asserts sweeping claims that conflict with those of its neighbors, like the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Madonna has made a public appeal to Pope Leo XIV, urging him to visit Gaza to bring attention to the suffering of children caught in the conflict. In a social media post, she emphasized the urgent need for humanitarian aid and called on the pontiff to use his unique influence to help save innocent lives. Madonna clarified that her plea was not about taking sides in the war but was a humanitarian call to action, expressing that all children, including those held hostage, are suffering. This appeal follows the Pope's own recent calls for an immediate ceasefire and respect for humanitarian law in the region.</p>

The World Health Organization also appealed for access to pre-stock hospitals with medical supplies to address a catastrophic health situation. Israel denies a famine is occurring and has outlined its own plan to increase aid, while former world leaders have labeled the situation an "unfolding genocide."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld an Arkansas law that prohibits doctors from providing gender-affirming medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormones, to individuals under 18. The ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a lower court's decision that had blocked the nation's first such ban. Citing a recent Supreme Court decision regarding a similar Tennessee law, the court found that the ban does not violate the equal protection rights of transgender minors. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin praised the decision, while the ACLU condemned it as a "tragically unjust result" for transgender youth and their families.</p>

          <p>London is facing significant economic challenges, including a high cost of living, persistent inflation, and the ongoing effects of Brexit, which continue to create trade barriers and reduce productivity. The city's status as a global financial hub is under scrutiny as it struggles to compete with New York and Frankfurt, with IPO fundraising hitting a 30-year low. Despite these hurdles, there is some optimism, as the Bank of England's recent interest rate cut may spur consumption, and new trade deals outside the EU offer potential benefits. Business leaders emphasize the need for growth-focused policies to revive London's economic powerhouse reputation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The state of California is legally challenging the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement. State lawyers contend the deployment created a climate of "anxiety and fear" and represents an unprecedented use of a "standing army" in civilian life. The federal government maintains the deployment was legal under Title 10, which allows the president to use Guard forces during a "rebellion," to protect federal property and personnel. The court case is scrutinizing the president's authority to define such conditions and deploy troops accordingly.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the greatest danger from the upcoming Trump-Putin summit is not a military concession, but President Trump adopting Vladimir Putin's narrative about the war in Ukraine. The author suggests Putin will frame the conflict as a result of Ukrainian corruption and Western interference, portraying a peace deal on his terms as a reasonable solution. If Trump emerges from the meeting echoing these points, it could undermine international support for Ukraine and pressure Kyiv into an unjust and unworkable peace agreement. The analysis concludes that Putin's goal is to manipulate Trump into bullying Ukraine toward capitulation under the guise of a diplomatic victory.</p>

A separate report from England's housing watchdog likens the scale of window safety defects to problems with damp and mould, noting that landlords sometimes ignore complaints even when children are at risk.

          <h2>Federal Judge Orders Trump Administration to Restore Hundreds of Suspended UCLA Research Grants</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of science research grants at UCLA, totaling over a third of the $584 million in funding that was abruptly frozen. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the National Science Foundation's indefinite suspension of the grants violated her previous injunction and differed from a termination in name only. The administration had frozen the funds citing alleged discrimination and antisemitism at the university, demanding over $1 billion for their restoration. This ruling is a significant victory for the affected researchers and strengthens UCLA's position in resisting the administration's demands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite administration claims that a new Florida detention center dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" would house "the worst of the worst," an investigation has found that many detainees have no criminal history. Some of those held are beneficiaries of the DACA program, which protects undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. Federal statistics show nearly half of all migrants detained by ICE in June lacked a criminal record. An ICE official stated that entering the country illegally is a crime, but immigration attorneys express concern that this sets a precedent for deporting any DACA recipient.</p>

          <p>An annual global human rights report from the Trump administration has stated that the human rights situation in the United Kingdom "worsened" over the past year. The report specifically cited concerns over restrictions on freedom of expression, such as laws targeting "hateful" speech, and buffer zones around abortion clinics that prohibit some forms of protest. It also pointed to threats of violence motivated by antisemitism. A UK government spokesperson responded by stating that free speech is vital and that the country is proud to uphold freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Popular rapper and YouTuber DDG was briefly detained by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in what appears to have been a swatting incident. DDG stated on social media that he was at a paintball tournament when multiple police cars surrounded him at gunpoint without explanation. Swatting involves making a false report of a serious crime to provoke a large law enforcement response. While in the back of a patrol car, DDG said he saw information on a police laptop indicating someone had falsely reported he was armed and planning to harm himself and others, leading to his 20-minute detention before being released.</p>

          <p>A recent collision involving a Chinese warship and a coast guard vessel near the disputed Scarborough Shoal is expected to heighten tensions in the South China Sea. The incident occurred as the ships were reportedly chasing a Philippine patrol boat. While China has not officially confirmed the collision, experts warn it could prompt Beijing to improve coordination between its naval and coast guard forces to prevent future accidents. Analysts suggest the event will likely lead to an even greater Chinese maritime presence in the contested waters as Beijing continues to project power and assert its territorial claims.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggling bullpen has suffered another setback, with right-handed reliever Brock Stewart being placed on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation. Stewart was a key trade deadline acquisition intended to bolster a relief corps already plagued by injuries. While the team is optimistic that the injury was caught early and he will return this season, his absence adds another layer of uncertainty for a team that has lost 19 of its last 31 games. In other injury news, starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin underwent season-ending elbow surgery, further challenging the team's pitching depth.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Washington D.C., this article explains the legal framework governing their actions. Because D.C. is a federal district, the president has direct authority over its Guard units. The troops are activated under Title 32, which grants them arrest powers, though officials state their current mission is to support law enforcement, not to directly engage in it. The deployment is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically restricts military involvement in domestic law. The president also has temporary control of the D.C. police force under the Home Rule Act, a move the city's mayor has called unsettling.</p>

Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine will not withdraw its forces from the occupied Donbas region, viewing it as a potential launchpad for future Russian offensives. He expressed concern that a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin would primarily benefit the Russian leader by providing a valuable photo opportunity without substantive Ukrainian input.</p>

Edwards' husband expressed shock and dismay that the bail was set at $50,000, stating it cost more to bury his wife than for the suspect to be released.

In a series of social media posts mocking Trump, Newsom declared that California could not stand by while a "power grab unfolds." The governor plans to ask voters to approve a new map that could create five more Democratic seats, a move intended to offset potential Republican gains from gerrymandering in other states.

While some industry investors have labeled the bid a "stunt" and noted it is likely far below Chrome's true value, Perplexity stated the move would be a commitment to the open web and user choice.
