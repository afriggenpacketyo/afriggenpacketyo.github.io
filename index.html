          <p>Officer Kristian White was sentenced to a two-year community corrections order and 425 hours of community service for the manslaughter of 95-year-old Clare Nowland, who died after being tasered.  The judge deemed a jail sentence unnecessary given White's loss of employment and community standing, and the difficulty a former officer might face in prison. This decision sparked public outrage and controversy, with Nowland's family expressing disappointment and a sense of injustice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts will significantly impact various automakers.  While US-based manufacturers like Tesla and Rivian are expected to be less affected due to domestic production, companies like General Motors and Stellantis, with significant foreign production, face substantial cost increases.  The tariffs are likely to lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced competition, potentially benefiting domestic producers but harming consumers and international trade.</p>
