          <p>This article analyzes the interest-earning potential of certificates of deposit (CDs) in the current economic climate, where short-term CD rates are unusually higher than long-term ones. It breaks down the specific returns for a $10,000 deposit across various CD terms, from three months to five years. Despite higher rates on short-term options, the analysis shows that long-term CDs ultimately generate significantly more interest due to the extended compounding period. The decision between them depends on a saver's individual financial goals and timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Unite union has suspended Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her stance on the long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. The move escalates a conflict between the union and the Labour government, as Rayner had encouraged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. The union, a major Labour funder, also passed a motion to re-examine its relationship with the party if any members face redundancy, signaling a significant political and financial rift.</p>

The hospital has stopped admitting new patients after Israeli tanks advanced nearby, and life-saving services are at risk of shutting down completely. Medical staff who remain inside with dozens of critical patients describe being mentally and physically exhausted while working with minimal resources amid constant shelling and gunfire.</p>

          <p>Francisco Martinez, a mayor in northwestern Honduras who was running for reelection, was found dead after being abducted by armed men from a motel. Police discovered his bullet-ridden body near a soccer field but stated the motive was likely "personal revenge" rather than political. The incident underscores the high levels of violence in Honduras, which are largely attributed to drug trafficking and gang activity. Martinez had a previous arrest record from 2015.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's proposed tax legislation could create a "SALT torpedo," leading to an unexpectedly high tax rate for some high-income earners. The bill raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 but phases it out for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. Tax professionals warn this phaseout effectively creates a marginal federal tax rate as high as 45.5% on income within that specific range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has weighed in on the U.S. Ryder Cup captaincy debate, suggesting the potential for Keegan Bradley to serve as a playing captain highlights a key difference between the teams.
