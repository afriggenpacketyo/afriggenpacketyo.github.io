          <p>Following sectarian violence in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, Syria, Druse leaders have agreed to integrate militia fighters into government forces in exchange for government concessions, including investigations into abuses during the clashes. The violence was incited by a debunked audio clip and led to at least 101 deaths, prompting intervention from Israel. Despite the agreement, many Syrians remain wary of the new Islamist government, and disagreements persist over the cause of the violence, with some Sunnis blaming Druse militants and vice versa. The government has promised to protect everyone, but some residents remain skeptical, emphasizing the need for security and the importance of the Druse militias' weapons for their own protection.

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not strike a trade deal with the U.S. unless all new tariffs are reviewed, highlighting a disagreement over which tariffs are negotiable. Japan is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties on the auto industry, while the U.S. is unwilling to back off from duties on automobiles and steel/aluminum. A new 25 percent tariff on certain auto parts has taken effect, prompting strong disappointment from Japan. (optimism score: 45)</p>

          <h2>New Tariffs on Imported Auto Parts Could Raise Vehicle Prices</h2>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, intended to promote domestic manufacturing, will affect even cars made in the U.S. due to reliance on foreign components. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, automakers and suppliers face challenges in relocating assembly lines. The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and contribute to overall inflation. (optimism score: 35)</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches aides to avoid elderspeak, which is communication to older adults that sounds like baby talk. Studies show that elderspeak, often arising from ageist assumptions, can lead to resistance to care and lower use of antipsychotic drugs. The program involves videos and discussions to reduce elderspeak in nursing homes. While well-intended, elderspeak can alienate older adults and make them feel less like individuals.
