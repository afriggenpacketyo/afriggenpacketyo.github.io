          <p>Automotive group Stellantis announced it anticipates a net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of 2025, a significant downturn from the previous year. The company attributed the expected loss to several factors, including €3.3 billion in pre-tax charges, increased industrial costs, and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs, which are projected to cost €300 million. Stellantis also reported a 6% year-over-year decline in second-quarter vehicle shipments, with a notable 25% drop in North America due to reduced manufacturing of imported vehicles. The company's stock has fallen over 37% this year amid these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent confrontation between police and miners during the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident, which occurred outside a coking plant in Rotherham, resulted in over 100 injuries and the arrest of 95 miners, whose prosecutions later collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for four decades. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for 13 years, expressed cautious elation at the decision to investigate the events and their aftermath.</p>

          <p>Investor demand in China for bond-tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has surged, pushing total assets under management past $50 billion as of June. This represents a fivefold increase from the beginning of last year, driven by a search for low-risk returns in a deflationary economic environment. Investors are particularly drawn to ETFs targeting corporate notes, which offer diversification, lower costs, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The trend reflects hedging against economic uncertainty and weak consumption, even as China's central bank has warned about risks from an over-extended bond rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe's petrochemical industry is in a state of crisis, marked by a wave of plant closures and significant financial losses due to high production costs and intense global competition, particularly from China and the U.S. Many of the continent's aging and smaller-scale facilities are becoming uneconomical, leading to a growing reliance on chemical imports. In response, the European Commission has pledged support for strategic chemical production, but industry leaders warn it may be too late to reverse the decline. Companies like Eni, Dow, and ExxonMobil are either closing or reviewing their European assets as the region's industrial backbone erodes.</p>

The withdrawal has allowed humanitarian aid convoys to enter the city, which faces shortages of essential supplies.

          <p>Fierce price wars across various Chinese industries, from electric vehicles to food delivery, are providing consumers with cheap deals but also creating hidden costs and concerns. While buyers are attracted to steep discounts, some acknowledge that the cutthroat competition can lead to compromises in product quality and safety. The Chinese government has recently vowed to regulate this "irrational" competition, warning that it hurts corporate profits, wages, and ultimately consumer interests by potentially driving higher-quality goods out of the market. The trend reflects a broader shift to price-sensitive consumption in China's post-pandemic economy.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a recent election. Despite the "harsh result," which reflects voter frustration over rising prices and other economic issues, Ishiba has stated he does not intend to resign. The defeat undermines the coalition's influence, as it had already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Analysts note that the loss could destabilize the government at a critical time for trade negotiations and potentially open the door for leadership challenges within the LDP.</p>

          <p>A spectacular and bizarre car accident in the German town of Bohmte has left two people seriously injured. A car reportedly veered off the road at high speed, crashed through a hedge, and landed on a trampoline in a backyard, seriously injuring a seven-year-old boy who was playing on it. The vehicle then appeared to bounce and was flung into the air, ultimately crashing into the attic of a barn about three meters off the ground. The 43-year-old female passenger was also seriously injured, while the driver and three other children in the car sustained only light injuries.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is used to house asylum seekers, escalated into violence, leading to six arrests. Over 1,000 demonstrators gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The disorder followed the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault. Police implemented a dispersal order to prevent further anti-social behavior, with a chief superintendent describing the escalation as "mindless thuggery."

          <p>Police are investigating an apparently intentional act in which a driver rammed a vehicle into a crowd of people outside a nightclub in Los Angeles, injuring 36 individuals. The incident occurred early Saturday morning, with at least seven of the victims reported to be in critical condition. According to the LAPD, the driver made a U-turn before accelerating into the crowd. Bystanders reportedly pulled the driver from the vehicle and attacked him; he was also shot at some point by another individual who then fled the scene. The driver has been booked for assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face drug and arms trafficking charges.

His gang is linked to powerful international criminal organizations and is blamed for much of the violent crime that has plagued Ecuador. The extradition follows a referendum where Ecuadorean citizens approved the measure, reflecting President Daniel Noboa's hardline stance against organized crime in the country.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be effective in treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients and small-scale studies report that the drugs not only aid in weight loss but also help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce testosterone levels, and improve other metabolic and hormonal symptoms associated with PCOS. While larger clinical trials are needed, some health experts see massive potential for these treatments to address a significant unmet need.

The machine's powerful magnetic field violently pulled him in by the chain, causing him to suffer a series of heart attacks from which he did not recover. The incident is a stark reminder of the extreme dangers posed by metallic objects near MRI machines, which exert incredibly strong magnetic forces.</p>

This divergence is central to the broader U.S.-China rivalry. Beijing's strategy links green energy development directly to its technological and economic ambitions, whereas Washington's current approach prioritizes fossil fuels over renewable sources, creating different long-term energy landscapes.</p>

          <p>Recent market data suggests that large holders ("whales") and miners have been selling significant amounts of Bitcoin, potentially signaling a "local top" or increased volatility. On July 15, Bitcoin exchange inflows hit their highest daily level since February, driven by large transfers and miner outflows. A similar pattern was observed for Ethereum. Analysts at CryptoQuant view this confluence of selling into strength as a caution flag for traders, as such spikes have historically preceded price pullbacks. Despite this, overall bullish momentum appears to remain, with capital rotating into higher-beta assets like Ethereum. (not investment advice)</p>
