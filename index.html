            <p>Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, alleged to be a top MS-13 gang leader, is requesting a delay in the dismissal of his criminal case, despite the Justice Department's motion to deport him. Villatoro Santos fears immediate deportation to El Salvador's CECOT prison without due process. His attorney argues that the government's actions and public pronouncements pose a substantial risk of unlawful deportation. Villatoro Santos was arrested in Virginia following a publicized raid.

            <p>With escalating tariffs deepening the rift between Beijing and Washington, diplomatic backchannels may play a crucial role in bringing the leaders to the negotiating table. Despite announcing another tariff hike on Chinese imports, President Trump signaled he didn't expect to raise them further, suggesting China wants a deal but struggles with the approach. Observers believe that diplomatic backchannels "might be the only way to go" in these tense circumstances. This article suggests the importance of behind-the-scenes communication to de-escalate trade tensions.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have fallen in March as the trade war with the US intensifies, with US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes impacting the Chinese economy. The national consumer price index (CPI) dropped 0.1 per cent year on year. The decline reflects the continued risk posed by deflation to the Chinese economy, with the trade war likely to intensify the downward pressure on prices. The Chinese government is likely to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand amid the escalating trade war. (not investment advice)</p>
