          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing candidate, narrowly secured victory in Poland's presidential election, defeating Rafal Trzaskowski in a contest reflecting a divide between pro-EU and nationalist ideologies. The election outcome was initially uncertain, with early figures suggesting Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, held a lead. Nawrocki's win provides a significant boost to the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which lost power in 2023, and could potentially impede the centrist government's agenda led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. While both candidates expressed support for increased defense spending and continued assistance to Ukraine, they differed on Ukraine's future NATO membership, highlighting broader geopolitical considerations.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are leading efforts to address the historical underrepresentation of Southeast Asian populations in genomic research. The Kunming Institute of Zoology, in collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams, has created the SEA3K data set, the first comprehensive genomic atlas of the region. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical environments and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. This initiative aims to rectify the previous oversight in the Human Genome Project and contribute to a more inclusive understanding of human genetic diversity.</p>

The meeting, prompted by US President Donald Trump, follows initial discussions where both parties agreed to a large-scale prisoner swap and explored visions of a peace deal. These talks occur after recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian airbases, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has requested a full ceasefire, prisoner release, and a direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The victims, aged 52 to 88, were part of a gathering supporting Israeli hostages. The FBI is investigating the incident as a suspected act of terrorism, noting the use of a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in February 2023, and footage of the attack shows a chaotic scene with smoke, fire, and injured individuals.</p>

          <p>China has responded to accusations from Washington regarding violations of the Geneva trade agreement by asserting that the U.S. is the party breaching the deal's terms. Tensions between the two nations have escalated following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng, which initially led to a temporary suspension of tariffs. China's commerce department spokesperson criticized the Trump administration's increased export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, as well as the revocation of visas for Chinese students, warning of countermeasures to protect China's interests. The spokesperson also accused the U.S. of unilaterally provoking economic and trade frictions, increasing instability in bilateral relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economic outlook, the aviation industry is projected to experience improved profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The IATA report forecasts increases in revenue, operating profits, and net profits for the industry, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year, although fleet expansion faces challenges due to supply chain issues in the aerospace sector. The industry's resilience is attributed to minimal fuel hedging activity, allowing airlines to benefit from reduced fuel costs, and trade tensions are not expected to significantly impact fuel prices.

The stable has been closed since April 2024 after Miyagino's protege, Hokuseiho, was found to have physically abused junior wrestlers, leading to the transfer of wrestlers and elders to another stable. Hakuho, a record-holder with 45 elite-level championships and 1,187 matches, retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>

          <p>According to Polish media reports, conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki has won the presidential election with 50.89% of the vote, while Rafal Trzaskowski received 49.11%. The Electoral Commission is expected to officially announce the results later on Monday, but major Polish media outlets have already reported the outcome based on the count of over 99% of the votes. The Polish president primarily has a ceremonial role but can veto government bills, influence foreign policy, and propose legislation. Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government has faced challenges due to the current conservative president, Andrzej Duda, blocking reform efforts.</p>

          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged following the announcement of a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The new company will acquire all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger aims to unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure designed to fend off hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, expresses optimism for the future of AI and biotechnology despite the complexities of global scientific collaboration and geopolitical tensions. Diamandis emphasizes that scientific breakthroughs, regardless of their origin, benefit humanity as a whole due to the conserved nature of human biology and fundamental sciences. He voiced concern about the Trump administration's cuts to scientific funding, particularly at the National Institutes of Health, which he believes could have long-term implications for the speed of scientific discoveries. Diamandis aims to help people see the world in a more positive light through his work.</p>
