          <p>A large fire erupted at the Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, a major facility on the U.S. West Coast, following reports of an explosion that residents said felt like a small earthquake. Emergency crews, including the refinery's own fire department and the LA County Fire Department, responded swiftly to contain the blaze, successfully confining it to one area and averting the need for widespread evacuations. Although no injuries were reported and operations at the nearby Los Angeles International Airport were not impacted, officials advised residents to remain indoors as a precaution against potential changes in air quality from the smoke.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has placed a hold on $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago Transit Authority projects, the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the freeze, citing a need to ensure the funds are not used for race-based contracting requirements. This action follows similar freezes on infrastructure funding for New York City and climate-related projects in states won by Democrats, occurring amidst a government shutdown. The Department of Transportation is conducting an administrative review to check for unconstitutional practices.</p>

          <p>Apple has removed the ICEBlock app, which allowed users to report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from its App Store. The developer stated the removal was due to "objectionable content," following concerns from officials that such apps could endanger federal agents. ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan had previously argued that these tools cross a line from free speech into impeding law enforcement and creating dangerous situations. The removal comes after a gunman who attacked an ICE facility was found to have searched for similar tracking applications, highlighting the security risks involved.</p>

          <p>At Italian Tech Week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos characterized the current state of artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," where investor excitement leads to both good and bad ideas receiving funding. He compared it to past bubbles like the dot-com crash but emphasized that the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide enormous benefits to society. Bezos noted that while stock prices can become disconnected from business fundamentals during such periods, these bubbles can also spur significant innovation, similar to how the 1990s biotech bubble produced life-saving drugs despite many company failures.

          <p>Taiwan's first execution in five years has reignited the national debate over the death penalty, with human rights activists arguing it violated legal due process. The execution of Huang Lin-kai for a 2013 double murder occurred despite a recent Constitutional Court ruling that narrowed the scope of capital punishment and while an appeal was allegedly still pending. Supporters of the death penalty cite strong public opinion and its role in delivering retributive justice, while opponents argue it violates human rights and risks executing the innocent.

A government pathologist's provisional findings indicate a gunshot wound on one of the deceased victims, with police stating the only shots fired were by officers attempting to neutralize the threat and prevent the attacker from entering the synagogue.

Law enforcement announced that new DNA and ballistics technology has identified Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer, as the likely sole perpetrator. The case, which had previously resulted in coerced confessions and wrongful convictions, was cracked after an upgraded ballistics database linked a shell casing to another unsolved murder. This led to a re-examination of fragmented DNA evidence, which matched a sample from another crime scene previously linked to Brashers, bringing long-awaited answers to the victims' families.</p>

The research finds that the most effective way to avert this is for people in wealthier countries to adopt more plant-based diets and consume less meat and dairy. The report highlights a "global dietary inequality," where the diets of the richest 30% of the population account for over 70% of the food system's environmental pressures.

          <p>Charlene Tabet, a former member of the Burbank Unified School District Board of Education, is facing criminal charges for allegedly funneling $93,000 in district payments into her personal bank account. Tabet is accused of approving a contract with a company registered to her daughter to transcribe meeting minutes, then endorsing checks in her daughter's name. An internal investigation found that the district paid over 25 times the value of the work completed. The district's superintendent, John Paramo, resigned on the same day the allegations were made public, amid claims that he knowingly facilitated the scheme.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has criticized pro-Palestinian demonstrations that took place following the deadly terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue, calling the decision to proceed with them "un-British" and "wrong." She urged activists to "step back" from planned weekend marches, asking them to consider the feelings of those who lost loved ones in the attack. The comments came after protests in Manchester and London, where clashes with police led to 40 arrests. The UK's Chief Rabbi also called on the government to "get a grip" on the demonstrations, which he described as dangerous and containing "outright antisemitism."</p>

          <p>Now in its third day, the U.S. government shutdown has led to the postponement of the monthly jobs and unemployment report from the Labor Department, a crucial indicator of the nation's economic health. The political impasse continues with Democrats refusing to approve funding without addressing expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, while Republicans insist on a short-term resolution. The shutdown's effects are widespread, with the Trump administration also using the opportunity to pressure universities with demands in exchange for priority access to federal grants. This disruption leaves policymakers and the public without key data to assess the economy.</p>

          <p>Munich airport experienced significant disruptions after multiple drone sightings forced a temporary halt to all air traffic on Thursday evening. The closure led to the cancellation of 17 flights and the diversion of 15 others, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. Police conducted a search of the area, including with a helicopter, but did not find the drone operator. The incident, which occurred during the final weekend of Oktoberfest, is the latest in a series of similar airport disruptions across Europe and has prompted Germany's interior minister to call for increased funding for drone defense technologies.</p>

His defense attorneys are requesting a 40-year minimum sentence, arguing for mercy based on the "immeasurable trauma" Sweeney experienced throughout his childhood.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is following Richard Nixon's strategy of pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates for short-term political gain, specifically to boost the economy ahead of midterm elections. The author warns this approach risks long-term economic damage, recalling how Nixon's interference led to rampant inflation in the 1970s that required a severe recession to control. While acknowledging the current economy's surprising resilience, the article suggests that undermining the Fed's independence could spook financial markets and ultimately lead to stagflation, even if it serves Trump's immediate political goals.

The bill mandates a five-year sentence for those who commit a crime punishable by over one year in prison, and a ten-year sentence for those who commit a crime punishable by up to two years. Criminal justice reform advocates argue the bill is an impractical "mass incarceration" measure that would overwhelm federal prisons and courts at enormous cost.

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the recent call by thousands in the film industry to boycott Israeli cinema, asserting that such an action is ill-conceived. The author uses the example of "The Sea," an Israeli-funded film about a Palestinian boy that just won Israel's top film award, to illustrate how the country's cinema often provides a powerful platform for criticizing government policy and exploring the occupation. Because filmmaking in Israel relies on state funding, a boycott effectively targets one of the most potent mediums for changing Israeli public opinion from within. The author contends that instead of shunning Israeli filmmakers, the international community should support them.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's newly announced "TrumpRx" website suggests it may not significantly lower prescription drug costs for most Americans. The plan, which aims to offer discounted drugs for cash-paying customers, faces several challenges: over 90% of Americans have insurance and are better off using it to meet deductibles. For the uninsured, similar services like GoodRx already exist and may offer even lower prices than those previewed by the White House. A concurrent deal with Pfizer to lower Medicaid prices is also viewed skeptically by experts, as the agreement is voluntary, confidential, and may not result in savings beyond existing mandatory rebates.</p>
