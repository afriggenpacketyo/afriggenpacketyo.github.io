        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Democratic Senator Alex Padilla's forcible removal from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference, numerous lawmakers have voiced their outrage and are demanding answers. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer seeks clarification on the incident, while Senator Adam Schiff calls for Noem's resignation and an investigation into law enforcement's conduct. The incident sparked widespread condemnation from Senate Democrats, with some describing it as an assault on democracy, while even some Republicans like Senator Lisa Murkowski expressed shock and dismay at the treatment of Senator Padilla, highlighting the severity of the situation. Senator Padilla was later able to meet with Secretary Noem after the incident.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to consider whether to restrict President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to assist with federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president unlawfully bypassed him when calling the National Guard into service. The Trump administration defends the deployment as necessary to protect ICE and federal employees from escalating protests, with Justice Department lawyers calling Newsom's request for relief a "crass political stunt endangering American lives." The situation has heightened tensions between the federal government and California officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a congressional hearing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to confirm that the Pentagon has developed contingency plans to potentially take over Greenland and Panama by force if necessary. When questioned by Democratic Representative Adam Smith, Hegseth stated that the Defense Department's job is to have plans for any contingency. While Hegseth did not explicitly confirm plans to invade Greenland, his responses prompted Republican Representative Mike Turner to clarify that Hegseth was not confirming any specific invasion plans. Hegseth's use of Signal chats to discuss plans for U.S. strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen also drew scrutiny from lawmakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that the Republican tax bill could negatively impact the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households, potentially reducing their financial resources by $1,600 per year. The CBO found that the bill would boost resources for the highest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $12,000 per year, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000. The analysis highlights concerns that the proposed legislation could hurt vulnerable households by cutting Medicaid and other benefits, while providing tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans (not investment advice). The CBO's findings have fueled criticism from congressional Democrats and advocates for low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure in anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, has posted a $1 bond after a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting him. The judge sided with Khalil, stating that the government cannot enforce what appears to be an unconstitutional law. Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested after leading student protests and argues that his free speech rights are being violated. The Department of Homeland Security claims Khalil lied on his visa applications, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio cites a provision allowing deportation if a noncitizen's presence has adverse foreign policy consequences.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice leadership has directed all 93 U.S. Attorney's Offices to be on alert over the weekend for potential violence at protests. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump are defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amid objections from Democrats. Preparations are underway in Washington for a massive military parade to mark the Army's 250th birthday. President Trump was met with mixed reactions while attending the opening night performance of the musical "Les Misérables" at the Kennedy Center.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed legislation aiming to rescind California’s auto emission standards, including a rule that would have banned the sale of new gas-only cars by 2035. Trump criticized California’s planned zero-emission requirements as a "disaster for our country," arguing they would raise car prices and strain electrical grids. Shortly after, California Attorney General Rob Bonta led a coalition of attorneys general in filing a lawsuit to challenge Trump’s laws, arguing Congress unlawfully acted to upend California’s emission rules. California's rules are historically stricter to account for its air quality.</p>
