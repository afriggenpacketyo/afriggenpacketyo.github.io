          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail, determining he unlawfully spent part of a previous sentence in a hospital. This decision requires him to be transferred to Bangkok Remand Prison, ending public outrage over alleged special treatment. Thaksin's daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, stated her father remains in good spirits despite the ruling, vowing to continue the family's political work. This case adds another chapter to the influential Shinawatra dynasty's ongoing legal and political challenges in Thailand.</p>

          <p>India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar pressed BRICS members to tackle trade imbalances with New Delhi, highlighting that India's largest deficits are with its BRICS partners. This occurred during a virtual summit where China's President Xi Jinping also criticized U.S. trade protectionism. India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, contrasting with China and Russia's geopolitical perspective. The article notes rising trade deficits, particularly with China and Russia, and ongoing trade tensions between India and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Russia executed its most extensive aerial strikes on Ukraine to date, killing four, including a baby, and targeting cities like Kyiv with over 800 drones and 13 missiles. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned the attack, seeking a strong U.S. response. Analysts suggest Russia aims to overwhelm air defenses, damage critical infrastructure, and instill panic among the population, especially discouraging recruitment. This escalation, following failed peace talks, indicates Russia's commitment to mass drone attacks and a prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson expressed strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," stating the city received no prior notice of the ramped-up immigration enforcement. DHS announced the operation to target "criminal illegal aliens," citing a recent fatal hit-and-run involving an undocumented individual. Johnson condemned the federal action as militarized enforcement without due process, highlighting past human rights abuses by ICE. Illinois Governor Pritzker and Senator Durbin also criticized the Trump administration's approach, framing it as politically motivated rather than crime-fighting.</p>

          <p>A U.S. congressional panel has released a redacted copy of Jeffrey Epstein's 2003 "birthday book," alongside his will and address book. The book contains messages and photos, including a letter with a signature resembling former President Donald Trump's, which the White House denies he wrote. Other notable entries include an alleged message from former President Bill Clinton and a contribution from UK Ambassador Lord Peter Mandelson. The release stems from a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee, fueling ongoing scrutiny of Epstein's connections after his death by suicide in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking trial.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, has sued Meta, claiming the messaging service has "systemic cybersecurity failures" that jeopardize user privacy. Baig alleges he informed leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg, about issues like 1,500 engineers having unrestricted access to user data without an audit trail. Meta disputes these claims, stating Baig was dismissed for poor performance and is now publicizing distorted accusations. The lawsuit, filed after Baig's termination, highlights concerns about regulatory compliance and potential retaliation for his disclosures to the SEC and OSHA.</p>

While some within the party advocate for a quick, quiet process, others desire a Left-leaning candidate to voice concerns and act as a pressure valve.

          <p>The U.S. has experienced its sharpest decline in over 40 years of mothers with young children in the workforce, with over 400,000 women leaving their jobs in the first half of 2025. A University of Kansas analysis identifies childcare costs as the primary driver, making it financially unfeasible for many mothers to work. Mackenzie Bruegge's story exemplifies this trend, as she quit her medical billing job because childcare expenses would nullify her income. Economists warn that insufficient support policies for caregivers are forcing women out of the labor force, highlighting a systemic issue.</p>

          <p>England has published its first-ever league tables rating NHS trusts, with specialist hospitals topping the list and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, at the bottom due to structural issues. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to identify areas needing "urgent support" and end the "postcode lottery" in care. While top performers gain more autonomy, struggling trusts will receive support, with leader pay linked to performance. However, NHS Providers and think tanks express concerns about the metrics' accuracy and potential for trusts to prioritize rankings over comprehensive patient care.</p>

          <p>Ofsted is proceeding with its new "report card" system for inspecting schools in England, replacing the previous one-word grading system, effective November 10. The reform follows the suicide of head teacher Ruth Perry, to which a coroner ruled the prior inspection contributed. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson asserts the new five-point grading across multiple categories will provide greater detail for parents and help struggling schools. However, a coalition of school leaders and campaigners, including Perry's sister, strongly criticize the changes as a "cosmetic rebranding" that maintains a high-stakes, punitive regime, urging a delay.</p>
