        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UCLA Bruins endured a significant 30-23 loss to UNLV, marking a concerning 0-2 start to their season, a first since 2019. This defeat at Allegiant Stadium starkly exposed persistent team problems, including a slow and often out-of-position defense, alongside an offense that struggled significantly to sustain drives and convert critical opportunities. Despite quarterback Nico Iamaleava's determined efforts to orchestrate a late fourth-quarter comeback, moving the ball deep into UNLV territory, a crucial tipped pass ultimately resulted in an interception, definitively ending their hopes. This early season setback against a Mountain West Conference opponent places considerable pressure on Coach DeShaun Foster to swiftly address the team's fundamental strategic and execution issues.</p>

          <p>Russian overnight drone attacks on Kyiv resulted in at least two fatalities, including a one-year-old baby whose body was recovered from rubble, and left eleven people injured. Multiple multi-story residential buildings in the Svyatoshynkyi and Darnytskyi districts were hit and caught fire, prompting Kyiv's military administration to urge residents to seek shelter. Similar strikes targeted President Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih, hitting three infrastructure facilities, as air raid warnings were activated nationwide. This escalation follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's intensified warnings against Western aid to Ukraine, rejecting proposals for a post-ceasefire "reassurance force."</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney underwent a dramatic physical transformation for her role as legendary boxer Christy Martin in the upcoming film "Christy," gaining over 30 pounds. Her preparation involved rigorous three-times-daily training with boxing and weight coaches, alongside a specialized diet that notably included frequent Chick-fil-A meals and milkshakes. Sweeney expressed feeling profoundly stronger and deeply inspired by embodying such a powerful woman, while Martin herself lauded Sweeney's accurate portrayal of both her bombastic boxing persona and her reserved private self. The film, which delves into Martin's challenging life, including a domestic violence survival story, garnered a standing ovation at TIFF and is already generating significant Oscar buzz for Sweeney's compelling performance.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, where they addressed the growing threat of oligarchic control in the US. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist backed by progressives, condemned CUNY's dismissal of anti-war Palestinian solidarity professors and vowed to freeze rents, increase housing, and raise taxes for the wealthiest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" against powerful billionaires and criticized mainstream Democrats for their lack of support. The event underscored a broader fight for the Democratic Party's future and the need to mobilize against concentrated wealth and political influence.</p>

The technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form vapor bubbles. The sudden collapse of these bubbles, a process known as cavitation, releases a strong force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. By precisely controlling the light flow, scientists can manipulate the launch and even enable the small materials to swim, showcasing an efficient new launching mechanism.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who served in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who have performed dangerous front-line roles in the military. She co-founded Sisters in Service, a community interest company that supports female military veterans working in healthcare, noting that women often face additional challenges due to misconceptions about their service. Bennett emphasizes that many people hold an "outdated idea" that only men deploy to the front line, despite women's crucial roles in modern conflicts. The group provides a "cathartic" network for women to share experiences, offering a vital community that traditional veteran spaces may not fully provide.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, a globally sacred site revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is embroiled in controversy due to Egyptian plans to transform it into a luxury tourism mega-project. The "Great Transfiguration Project" involves constructing hotels, villas, and shopping bazaars, which critics argue destroy the area's natural characteristics and spiritual significance. The indigenous Bedouin Jebeleya tribe, known as the Guardians of St Catherine, have had their homes demolished with little compensation, and even graves moved for a new car park. UNESCO has raised concerns and called for a conservation plan, as the project is seen as insensitive interference prioritizing commercial development over cultural and environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new ICE operation, "Patriot 2.0," in Massachusetts, targeting immigrants for arrest and deportation, particularly those released from local custody in so-called sanctuary cities. This operation follows a similar surge in May and comes as Chicago also braces for increased immigration enforcement. DHS officials stated the operation aims to target "the worst of the worst" criminals, criticizing Boston's sanctuary policies for allegedly protecting public safety threats. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has defended her city's policies as crucial for community policing and safety, while actively preparing for potential federal National Guard deployment and reviewing legal precedents.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report into Lisbon's deadly funicular crash revealed that a cable linking the two cabins snapped shortly before the derailment, which killed 16 people and injured 21. The report by Portugal's GPIAAF stated that the cable had passed a visual check just hours before the accident, and the scheduled maintenance plan was up to date. The incident occurred within 50 seconds of the cabins losing their balancing force, with the cable giving way at its attachment point to the upper cabin. Two independent investigations are underway to determine the full causes of the accident involving the 140-year-old Gloria funicular.</p>

          <p>Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are extensively using decoy military equipment, such as inflatable tanks and flat-pack guns, to deceive enemies and waste valuable ammunition. Ukraine, for instance, deploys plywood models of M777 howitzers, which can be assembled quickly and cost significantly less than the Russian Lancet kamikaze drones used to target them. These imitations, ranging from 2D models to those mimicking heat signatures or radar traffic, are crucial for drawing fire and overloading air defenses. The success of these decoys often depends on realistic deployment, including recreating full positions with wheel ruts and ammunition crates, fooling even visiting officers.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with his canonization ceremony presided over by Pope Leo on Sunday. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis, who died of leukemia at 15, created websites documenting miracles to spread Catholic teachings. His canonization was fast-tracked after Pope Francis attributed two miracles to him, with his body now preserved in wax in Assisi, Italy. Our Lady of Dolours Church in Chelsea, where he was baptized, has become another pilgrimage site, featuring a shrine with a strand of his hair. Young Catholics, like Diego Sarkissian, feel a strong connection to Acutis, seeing him as a relatable figure who played video games and wore jeans.</p>

Her successor, Chloe Malle, plans to focus on less frequent, themed issues to make print Vogue a collectible item in an increasingly digital world. Critics debate Vogue's current influence, with some seeing it as a relic, while others acknowledge its enduring brand power, largely tied to Wintour's iconic persona.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end a tariff exemption for low-cost imports, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The elimination of the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, which previously escaped customs charges, has caused major operational disruptions. Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended services to the US as carriers are unwilling or unable to collect the new duties. The UPU expressed concerns that members were given insufficient time and guidance to comply with the executive order, which aims to prevent foreign businesses from evading tariffs and criminals from importing drugs.

For first-time users, the process involves registering biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo, at kiosks or with border officers.

Compounded by extreme weather events, sea levels could rise by as much as 5 meters, with human-caused climate change accelerating these events.
