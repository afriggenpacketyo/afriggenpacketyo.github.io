          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, effective June 9, restricts entry to the U.S. for nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns. The proclamation also imposes partial restrictions on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, with stricter visa checks. Exemptions include green card holders, dual nationals with U.S. passports, athletes, diplomats, and close relatives of U.S. citizens. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and politically motivated, while the administration asserts it addresses security risks and visa overstays. The new policy also targets foreign students at Harvard University, alleging entanglements with foreign countries and civil rights violations, suspending their entry for six months and directing the State Department to review existing visas.</p>

          <p>The FBI is seeking a suspect who allegedly assaulted a federal officer and damaged government property during anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information. The suspect reportedly threw rocks at law enforcement vehicles, injuring an officer and damaging property. FBI Director Kash Patel has warned that assaulting law enforcement officers will result in jail time, regardless of background or cause. The Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops in Los Angeles to address the demonstrations, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is seeking to rescind the deployment and has threatened legal action. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also urged the administration to end the federal deployment.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating that stimulus measures have not effectively boosted domestic consumption. The consumer price index decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices dropped by 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023, with automotive price wars and falling property prices contributing to the downward pressure. Despite strong exports, there is a growing need for domestic demand to combat deflation, according to analysts. Chinese policymakers have been urged to implement more forceful and targeted stimulus measures to boost consumption, and there is speculation that the central bank may further lower the reserve requirement ratio to support growth (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the award as inadequate. The vote is considered crucial, potentially leading to a strike ballot if the offer is rejected, marking a significant moment for the profession. Ministers have announced pay awards following review body recommendations, including an average increase for resident doctors and consultants. The RCN argues that nursing has been undervalued and that a decade of pay erosion has led to increased numbers of nurses leaving the profession, with the Department of Health and Social Care stating that the pay rise is the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in the last 10 months.</p>

          <p>Lauren Tomasi, a U.S. correspondent for Australia’s 9News, was reportedly hit by a rubber bullet while covering immigration protests in Los Angeles. Footage shows a police officer appearing to fire in Tomasi's direction, striking her leg as she wrapped up a live broadcast. 9News stated that Tomasi and her cameraperson are safe and will continue covering the events. An Australian lawmaker, Sarah Hanson-Young, has urged Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to raise the incident with U.S. President Donald Trump, calling it “shocking” and “completely unacceptable.”</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets along the seafloor, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of oceans, and the announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect marine animals and the seabed. The extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).</p>

Following a phone conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, it is hoped that shipments of rare earths minerals and magnets to the US will resume.

The report of the slowdown comes just hours before another round of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in London.
