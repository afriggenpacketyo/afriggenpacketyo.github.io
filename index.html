          <p>President Donald Trump announced his recommendation for a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing ongoing trade imbalances and difficult negotiations. Trump stated the EU was formed to take advantage of the United States on trade, referencing trade barriers, VAT taxes, and lawsuits against American companies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hoped this would 'light a fire under the EU' to negotiate more favorable terms. The announcement caused a drop in U.S. stock futures and European stock markets, reflecting investor concerns about escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a month-long trial, eight out of ten people were convicted in Paris for the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian, where millions of dollars worth of jewelry was stolen. The ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, received the heaviest sentence of eight years, though most of it was suspended, and he will not return to prison due to time already served. Kardashian expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice and acknowledged the lasting impact of the crime on her and her family. The defendants, dubbed the 'Grandpa robbers' due to their ages, were convicted on charges ranging from direct involvement to complicity, with sentences reflecting their age and health issues.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily blocked lower court orders requiring the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to provide information to a government watchdog group. The lawsuit tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force must comply with federal public records law. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking data about DOGE's operations and personnel. Roberts' stay allows the Supreme Court time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, delaying deadlines for document turnover and a deposition of DOGE's acting administrator.</p>

          <p>This article outlines key considerations for beginners investing in gold in May 2025, noting gold's reputation as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. It suggests gold ETFs as an efficient entry point, cautioning against physical gold due to high premiums and storage concerns. The article emphasizes that gold prices don't always rise predictably with economic instability and advises a long-term perspective, treating gold as a portfolio hedge rather than a quick profit source. Finally, it warns of scams and inflated premiums, urging investors to conduct thorough research and work with reputable dealers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has reached an agreement with Boeing to avoid prosecution over the two 737 Max crashes that resulted in 346 deaths. Under the agreement, Boeing will "pay or invest" over $1.1 billion, including a criminal fine and compensation for crash victims' families. This agreement allows Boeing to avoid being labeled a felon, although families of the victims have criticized previous deals as being too lenient. The agreement aims to guarantee further accountability and substantial benefits from Boeing, while avoiding the uncertainty and litigation risk presented by proceeding to trial.</p>

          <p>Dave Nadig, an ETF expert, predicts a massive increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to SEC rule changes allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes. He estimates the number of ETFs could surge from 4,000 to over 7,000 within a month, creating a significant challenge for investors to navigate the expanded market. While many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, Nadig advises caution with new, straight-to-ETF strategies, particularly those involving illiquid assets like private credit. Nadig emphasizes that investors need to do thorough research to make informed decisions amidst the growing complexity of the ETF landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Mamdani has faced scrutiny for his anti-Israel rhetoric, including leading a 'BDS' chant at a protest.

Critics within the administration, however, describe the security detail as 'extravagant,' diverting resources from other senior leaders.

          <h2>Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over International Student Ban</h2>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the revocation of its ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit argues that the administration's action is unlawful and retaliatory, accusing it of violating Harvard's First Amendment rights. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned the action, stating that it imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars. A federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that Harvard had shown that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison has agreed to pay $82.5 million to cover costs and damages from the 2020 Bobcat fire, in what federal officials call a record settlement. The settlement comes as Edison seeks to raise customer rates to pay for wildfire mitigation and cover operating costs. Federal officials alleged that the Bobcat fire ignited when trees not properly maintained by Edison and its contractor came into contact with power lines. The settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing by Edison, and the funds will help rehabilitate burned areas and restore wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has created a 'Survey of Surveys' to identify and eliminate U.S. government surveys, raising concerns about bypassing OMB oversight. This effort duplicates OMB's existing review of federal surveys and may violate laws requiring the government to report statistics produced by canceled surveys. DOGE claims to have already terminated five 'wasteful' surveys, criticizing questions about internet usage and alcohol consumption. The 'Survey of Surveys' warns agencies of 'adverse actions' for non-participation, sparking criticism for its heavy-handed approach and potential disregard for federal law.</p>

          <p>This article explores the reasons why people continue to use X (formerly Twitter) despite its increasingly problematic content and association with far-right ideologies. The author points to specific incidents, such as the platform's chatbot promoting false claims about 'white genocide' and the release of an anti-Semitic song on the platform, as evidence of its decline. The article suggests that X has become a political weapon for its owner, Elon Musk, and questions whether users are aware of or condone the platform's growing culture of hate. The author ultimately challenges the continued use of X, given its role in normalizing and amplifying harmful content.</p>

          <p>Despite a Supreme Court ruling against a religious charter school in Oklahoma, conservatives may still achieve their goals through a growing school voucher movement. The House passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program, setting aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to pay for private education, including religious schools. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a dollar-for-dollar tax write-off for donations to nonprofits that grant private-education scholarships. While voucher advocates once focused on low-income students, they are now pushing for vouchers for most everyone, with the support of wealthy donors.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes tax rules that could significantly impact workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The 'No Tax on Tips' provision would create a new tax deduction, eliminating federal income taxes on tips for qualifying workers earning less than $160,000 annually. Similarly, the bill includes a tax break for workers receiving overtime pay, allowing them to claim a deduction on their taxes. However, there are restrictions, including the requirement for workers and their spouses to have Social Security numbers. Some experts argue that these tax breaks may disproportionately benefit higher-paid workers, while low-income workers may not see any benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

Molina, who was forced to work in a textile factory in Los Angeles, emphasizes the need for California to update its rules to align with federal anti-trafficking laws. The bill would require companies doing business with the state to have a plan to stop trafficking, train workers, and ensure subcontractors do the same.
