          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on the 17th stage. The anticipated bunch finish occurred despite heavy rain in the final 30 kilometers, which caused a crash involving some of Milan's key rivals. This victory strengthens Milan's hold on the green jersey for the points classification leader, extending his lead over Tadej Pogacar, who continues to hold the overall race lead in the yellow jersey. Milan expressed satisfaction with his performance but noted that challenging mountain stages still lie ahead.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing for Bryan Kohberger, the families of the victims delivered powerful and emotional impact statements directly addressing the convicted murderer. The sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves called him a "delusional, pathetic, hypochondriac loser," stating that her sister would have fought back fiercely if not attacked in her sleep. Xana Kernodle's sister spoke of the profound loss and her commitment to live in her sister's honor. The families' raw testimony filled the courtroom, emphasizing the deep and lasting pain caused by his actions while defiantly asserting that he had not won.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government has accused the Chinese Communist Party of attempting to interfere in its democratic process ahead of a historic recall vote targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators. The recall campaign, initiated by civic groups, accuses the lawmakers of being excessively close to Beijing. China's state media has actively commented on the vote, echoing KMT talking points and urging voters to oppose the recall. This political turmoil occurs as President Lai Ching-te's party lacks a parliamentary majority, leading to legislative gridlock and heightened tensions with Beijing, which considers Taiwan its own territory.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, the International Court of Justice has affirmed that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including historical greenhouse gas emissions. The non-binding ruling is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying Pacific islands that initiated the case out of frustration with global inaction. The UN court stated that failing to develop ambitious climate plans could breach the Paris Agreement and that countries have a right to seek compensation for climate-related damages. This decision could pave the way for legal claims against historically high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>With inflation and high interest rates straining budgets, many consumers carry a credit card balance, making it crucial to understand how minimum payments are determined. Issuers typically calculate this amount using one of several methods, such as a flat percentage of the balance (often 1-3%) or a formula combining 1% of the balance with accrued interest and fees. For a $2,000 balance at 22% APR, a minimum payment could range from $40 to nearly $60. While making the minimum payment keeps an account in good standing, it is an expensive long-term strategy due to compounding interest. (not investment advice)</p>

While there is no scientific evidence of harm from thimerosal, its removal is seen as a major victory for the anti-vaccine movement, which has long targeted the ingredient. Health experts worry the move could reinforce unfounded fears and potentially lead to lower vaccination rates, despite affecting only a small percentage of the total flu vaccine supply.</p>

          <p>Recent photos of the White House Rose Garden show that its iconic lawn has been replaced by a large concrete slab as part of ongoing renovations directed by President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. The President explained the change was for practical reasons, stating that soft, wet ground was problematic for press conferences and guests. This follows a controversial 2020 redesign by Melania Trump that was criticized for its stark aesthetic. A White House official described the current project as a "restoration" focused on preserving beauty while enhancing practical use, with completion expected by mid-August 2025.</p>

          <p>A patient at a children's hospital in South Carolina has died from primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare and devastating brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Health officials believe the exposure likely occurred at Lake Murray, marking the state's first known case since 2016. The infection, which has a fatality rate greater than 97%, typically happens when contaminated water from warm freshwater sources is forced up the nose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises swimmers to hold their nose or use nose clips when jumping into such bodies of water to reduce risk.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has stated that a new Ukrainian law curbing the independence of anti-corruption agencies could hamper the country's path to European Union membership. The legislation, signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, places two key anti-corruption bodies under the authority of the prosecutor general, sparking protests in Ukraine. Critics argue this move weakens the fight against corruption, a key requirement for EU accession. Wadephul emphasized that he expects Ukraine to continue its anti-corruption efforts consistently, a message he reportedly conveyed to his Ukrainian counterpart amid the controversy.</p>

While a match is not guaranteed, the company states it increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman pairing.

As part of the plan, federal procurement rules will be changed to favor AI platforms deemed free of "ideological bias." The administration also intends to use federal financing to promote the use of American-developed AI abroad, marking a significant shift from the previous focus on mitigating AI's risks.</p>

He was both the fearsome "Prince of Darkness" who helped invent heavy metal and the bumbling, lovable family man from the reality show "The Osbournes." This article reflects on how his music, born from a difficult working-class upbringing and personal struggles with addiction, channeled themes of confusion and survival rather than pure evil. His later-life fame on television revealed the warm human core beneath the terrifying persona, solidifying his status as a titan of rock who was ultimately relatable.</p>

M&S has since stopped using the image but defended its practices, stating it promotes inclusive fashion and ensures all its models are in good health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners unable to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), financial experts recommend first asking the lender for the specific reasons for the denial. Common obstacles include high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score, with lenders tightening standards amid higher interest rates. To improve approval odds, borrowers should focus on reducing debt, improving their credit score, and ensuring their finances are in order before reapplying. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives like a fixed-rate home equity loan, a cash-out refinance, or a personal loan may be viable options. (not investment advice)</p>

The men, who were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US, have long maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis.
