          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The firm is accused of manipulating the Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices by making large stock purchases to inflate prices, then betting on their decline and selling off to profit from the engineered downturn. SEBI described the behavior as egregious and a threat to market integrity, especially after the firm ignored a previous advisory. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to regulatory compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after a significant election win, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party is confronting substantial difficulties, including plummeting approval ratings and economic stagnation. Key promises to boost growth and improve household finances have not been met, with business optimism remaining low amid high inflation and borrowing costs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure over her fiscal policies, leading to a series of U-turns on welfare and spending. The government has achieved some success with international trade deals, but faces a growing domestic threat from the rival Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>In an interview marking his first anniversary as prime minister, Keir Starmer acknowledged a series of missteps and policy U-turns but defended his pragmatic approach to governance. He highlighted achievements such as reducing NHS waiting lists and securing trade deals, while taking responsibility for recent difficulties, including a controversial and ultimately reversed plan for welfare reform. Starmer emphasized that changing his mind is a sign of common sense rather than weakness. The article portrays a leader facing significant political pressure and public scrutiny after a tumultuous first year.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven individuals unaccounted for and two others injured. The blasts ignited multiple structures and sparked grass fires covering approximately 80 acres, prompting evacuations in the area. Investigations revealed the facility, linked to a county sheriff's lieutenant and a volunteer firefighter, was operating without the necessary local licenses for fireworks storage. Authorities are now using drones to assess the volatile scene as families await news of their missing loved ones.</p>

          <p>A bin strike in Birmingham has continued for six months, leading to what residents describe as "apocalyptic" piles of uncollected rubbish and a persistent stench across the city. The industrial action by Unite union members began in January over council plans to downgrade roles, escalating to an indefinite strike in March. With recycling collections also suspended, residents are storing waste in their homes or, in some cases, contaminating general waste bins. The city council, which already has one of the lowest recycling rates in the country, has yet to reach an agreement to end the dispute.</p>

The charges stem from an incident in October 2021, where McLemore assaulted a 21-year-old woman at a lake house party. Prosecutors successfully argued that the woman was incapacitated from alcohol and unable to give consent, while the defense had claimed the encounter was consensual.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a key early primary state, sparking speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. The tour will take him through eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties. While the state's Democratic Party chair framed the visit as an effort to show that rural voters are not forgotten, a political advisor to Newsom denied it was related to a presidential run. Instead, the advisor stated the focus is on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting issues with disaster relief.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant milestone in chimera research by growing a heart structure with human cells inside a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the human-cell-derived heart structure beat on its own for 21 days. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival and integration within the pig embryos. This development follows the same team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for organ generation for transplantation.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are backing an NAACP lawsuit that aims to block the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. The lawmakers filed an amicus brief arguing that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish a federal agency created by Congress. The suit follows administration actions that have significantly downsized the department's workforce and paused billions in education funding. Prominent Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin contend that these actions illegally circumvent Congress and threaten access to education nationwide.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Los Angeles County have issued water-contact warnings for eight beaches just before the July Fourth holiday weekend due to high levels of bacteria. The public is advised to avoid swimming, surfing, and other activities in the ocean water at specific locations, including areas of Santa Monica Beach, Avalon Beach on Catalina Island, and Mothers Beach in Marina Del Rey. The elevated bacteria levels are attributed to street runoff. Officials warn that contact with the contaminated water can cause illness or skin infections, particularly for children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee increase, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements. Additionally, the order calls for U.S. residents to receive preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permitting. The move is framed as part of an "America first" approach to the nation's parks.</p>

The individual crossed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was safely guided out of the mine-strewn area by a military team. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the person is unarmed and an investigation is underway, but did not specify if it is being treated as a defection. This border crossing occurs amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, despite recent efforts by South Korea to rebuild trust.</p>

During the maneuver, the car door hit the mother, causing her to fall and drop the infant. The baby was subsequently airlifted to a medical center for treatment.
