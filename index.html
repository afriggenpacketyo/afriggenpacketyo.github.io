          <p>Former President Donald Trump has indicated that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer being considered for the position of Federal Reserve chair, stating Bessent wishes to remain in his current role. This development narrows the field of potential nominees to four unnamed individuals. The announcement comes as the White House continues to advocate for lower interest rates, with potential candidates like Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett known to favor such policies. The search for a new chair intensifies following the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which provides an opportunity for Trump to appoint another official to the board.

This expansion follows the airline's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and is part of a broader strategy to establish at least a dozen intercontinental routes from its Seattle hub.

          <p>Following a recent emergency evacuation of an American Airlines flight in Denver, Senator Tammy Duckworth is formally demanding that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provide answers regarding current aircraft evacuation safety standards. Duckworth expressed serious concern that the FAA's 90-second evacuation rule is outdated and unrealistic, citing incidents where passengers retrieved carry-on bags, significantly delaying the process. In a letter to the new FAA Administrator, she has requested data from three recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated safety tests that were due in May. The senator argues that existing standards fail to account for real-world conditions, potentially endangering the flying public.</p>

The Kremlin's statement comes after President Donald Trump threatened to impose substantial new tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian oil. Trump accused India of profiting from the trade and fueling Russia's war efforts, suggesting tariffs could be raised significantly within 24 hours. In response, India has accused the U.S. and European nations of hypocrisy, pointing out their own continued trade with Russia, highlighting the complex geopolitical and economic tensions surrounding global energy markets.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has publicly criticized his mayoral opponent, Zohran Mamdani, for attending the funeral of a recently slain NYPD officer while allegedly ignoring services for other officers killed in the line of duty. Adams suggested the attendance was a politically motivated act, contrasting it with Mamdani's past calls to defund the police, a stance he has since moderated. The mayor pointed out that Mamdani did not publicly acknowledge or attend the funerals of six other officers who died since 2022. This confrontation highlights the contentious debate over policing and public safety as a central issue in the city's mayoral race.</p>

With over 700 active fires in Canada, 304 of which are out of control, and hazardous conditions in the American West, skies have become hazy for millions. Cities like Detroit and New York City may see some relief due to wind patterns, but heavy smoke is anticipated in the Great Lakes and Northeast regions. This year is on track to be Canada's second-most destructive wildfire season on record, underscoring the severe environmental and public health impacts of the ongoing blazes.</p>

          <p>The future of RB Leipzig's highly-rated striker, Benjamin Sesko, remains uncertain as both Manchester United and Newcastle United show strong interest in the £70 million player. Newcastle has reportedly made a formal offer, while Manchester United is still evaluating a potential deal, possibly needing to sell players first to finance the move. Sesko faces a choice between joining a rebuilding Manchester United, where he would likely be a starter but miss out on European competition, or moving to a Newcastle team that can offer Champions League football. Alternatively, the 22-year-old Slovenian could remain at Leipzig, awaiting potential offers from other top European clubs next summer.</p>

The rise in infections is compounded by planned restrictions on booster shots by the Trump administration, which has softened recommendations for children and pregnant people.

Attorneys for the 69-year-old, who suffers from multiple severe health conditions, argued the device could repeatedly shock his heart, prolonging the execution and inflicting pain. Although a lower court initially ordered the device to be deactivated, the state's supreme court overturned the decision. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and the state contends that he would not feel any potential shocks from the device once the lethal drug is administered.</p>

The issue gained prominence after a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where police withheld the suspects' status, sparking accusations of a cover-up. This contrasts with past incidents where police released ethnicity details to quell public unrest, illustrating the difficult balance between transparency, preventing misinformation, and ensuring a fair trial.</p>

The pharmaceutical giant reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that significantly beat Wall Street estimates, with its COVID vaccine Comirnaty and antiviral pill Paxlovid both posting large sales increases. The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, up from its previous forecast. This positive revision demonstrates growing confidence in Pfizer's strategy to navigate the post-pandemic market and deliver value to shareholders.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska was met with a contentious and hostile audience during a town hall meeting in Lincoln. The crowd frequently booed and heckled the congressman as he attempted to defend his support for a major policy and tax bill signed by President Donald Trump. Attendees voiced anger over the bill's changes to Medicaid and tax provisions, with repeated chants of "Tax the Rich!" and "vote him out!" Flood argued the legislation provides a middle-class tax cut and supports the state's infrastructure, but he struggled to be heard over the continuous interruptions from the disapproving crowd.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has stated in a new court filing that much of the information within the grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell investigation is already public knowledge. In a motion to unseal the documents, the DOJ provided an annotated version indicating that most testimony, excluding the identities of certain victims and witnesses, was revealed during Maxwell's trial or in public statements. The filing is part of a request for federal judges to release transcripts from both the Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein grand jury proceedings. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm a total of nearly £46 million for failures leading to the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse trapped the funds of approximately 300,000 investors. The FCA found that Woodford and his firm made "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions" by shifting the fund's portfolio into illiquid assets, which prevented them from meeting investor withdrawal requests. Woodford has been personally fined nearly £6 million and banned from senior management roles, though both he and the firm are appealing the decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency NASA is reportedly fast-tracking its plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon, setting an ambitious goal for completion by 2030. This initiative is a key component of American ambitions to create a permanent human settlement on the lunar surface and ensure a reliable power source during the two-week lunar nights. The move is seen by some as a response to similar plans announced by China and Russia, raising concerns that the new space race is driven by geopolitical competition rather than purely scientific goals. The project also faces significant hurdles, including recent cuts to NASA's budget and technical safety challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has partially blocked a new Arkansas law that mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in all public school classrooms and libraries. The ruling, however, is narrowly applied, granting an injunction that only covers the four school districts where parents filed the lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks described the law as "obviously unconstitutional" and part of a coordinated strategy by several states to inject religious doctrine into public schools. While a victory for the plaintiffs, the limited scope of the injunction means the law can still be enforced in over 200 other districts across the state.</p>

          <p>A coalition of non-profits, tribes, and local governments is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reverse the termination of the $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice (ECJ) block grant program. The lawsuit argues the Trump administration's decision to end the congressionally mandated program was unconstitutional and violated the separation of powers. The ECJ program was designed to fund community-led projects in historically disadvantaged areas to combat environmental hazards and improve climate resilience. This first-of-its-kind class action lawsuit seeks to reinstate the entire program and its nearly 350 grants, rather than forcing recipients to sue individually for damages.</p>

          <p>The newsletter platform Substack is emerging as a vital hub for literary discourse, providing a space for both established authors and new voices to engage directly with readers. As traditional media outlets reduce arts coverage, many writers and critics are turning to Substack to publish essays, serialize fiction, and build communities, a phenomenon being called "Substack summer." The platform is credited with generating buzz for novels from smaller presses that might otherwise be ignored. This trend is seen by some as a revival of the early-2000s blogosphere, fostering a new literary scene that champions long-form discussion and intellectual engagement around books.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy showed clear signs of a sharp slowdown as the July jobs report revealed that only 73,000 nonfarm payrolls were added, far below expectations. Compounding the weakness, significant downward revisions to the May and June figures brought the three-month average job gain to a mere 35,000. This sputtering labor market, a traditionally lagging indicator, has elevated concerns that the economy is on the brink of a recession. Economists point to the potential long-term impacts of tariffs on consumer spending and business investment as key risks, despite pushback from White House officials who maintain the economy remains fundamentally sound.

That project's estimated cost has tripled to over $110 billion with a completion date pushed into the 2030s.
