          <p>The FBI is investigating an attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, as a possible act of terror. Several people were injured in the incident, and a suspect is in custody.

The Boulder police responded to reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire, and while they acknowledged the tragedy, they refrained from labeling it as terror, as the investigation is still ongoing.

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California, new US-China tariff war can affect the Chinese tech sector in two main ways. Tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, and as Chinese companies face more trade barriers from the US, they‚Äôll need to work even harder on cutting costs and scaling up. As an example, many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models in response to the chip embargo, which is a more cost-effective and collaborative way to keep developing advanced technologies when resources are tight. Chinese companies are expected to aggressively pursue opportunities in other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepen trade with Europe, potentially offering technology transfers for market access.
