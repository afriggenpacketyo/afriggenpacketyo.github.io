          <h2>Intel Announces Expense Cuts Amid Weak Guidance Despite Earnings Beat</h2>

          <p>Intel reported first-quarter results that exceeded analysts' expectations but issued disappointing guidance and revealed plans to cut operational and capital expenses. The company expects lower revenue for the current quarter and anticipates breakeven earnings. These cost-cutting measures, including job cuts primarily targeting managers, are aimed at improving efficiency under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. While Intel's data center group saw sales growth, its PC chip business declined, and the company is striving to compete in the artificial intelligence sector against Nvidia.

          <h2>EPA to Eliminate Diversity Roles in Children's Health Programs</h2>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is eliminating or reassigning employees who are experts in children's health because their job descriptions include work on environmental justice or diversity, equity, and inclusion. The affected employees are regional children's health coordinators who work with schools and institutions to prevent environmental hazard exposures among young people. Critics argue that this move is an attack on children's health and will diminish expertise on issues affecting young bodies.</p>
