          <p>Health officials in Maine have confirmed three active cases of tuberculosis in the Greater Portland area, reflecting a broader national trend of increasing infections. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting contact tracing to test individuals who may have been exposed, noting that each case appears to have a separate source. While not as contagious as other airborne illnesses, tuberculosis remains the world's deadliest infectious disease, and its resurgence in the U.S. since 2021 has prompted public health concern and response.</p>

          <p>A 66-year-old retired accountant, Kent Broussard, has successfully auditioned for and joined the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band, realizing a dream he held since childhood. After retiring, Broussard decided to relearn the tuba and went through the same competitive audition process as his much younger bandmates, with the director making no exceptions for his age. Now the oldest member of the band by 41 years, Broussard's story highlights a message of pursuing lifelong goals and stepping out of one's comfort zone, regardless of age.</p>

The plan is contingent on the company achieving ambitious market capitalization and production goals over the next decade, including reaching an $8.5 trillion valuation. This proposal aims to ensure Musk's continued leadership at Tesla but requires shareholder approval and comes as a previous $50 billion pay package remains contested in court.

          <p>US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. is facing intense criticism for his recent actions at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the abrupt firing of its new director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy's moves, such as dismissing the entire vaccine advisory panel and hiring a known vaccine critic, have led to a wave of resignations from senior staff and raised alarms among scientists about political interference in public health. The conflict could have global repercussions, as the CDC has historically played a crucial role in international health crises.</p>

The annuity option is presented as a safer bet that provides a steady, long-term income stream. The first piece of advice for any winner is to remain anonymous, sign the ticket, and assemble a team of legal and financial professionals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has received a public admonishment from a state watchdog panel for a pattern of serious misconduct, including repeatedly threatening to shoot people in his courtroom. The Commission on Judicial Performance found that Judge Enrique Monguia made numerous inappropriate and biased remarks to attorneys, defendants, and victims, creating an atmosphere of intimidation. The judge, who did not contest the admonishment, was cited for abusing his authority and violating judicial rules of conduct, though he expressed remorse for his actions.</p>

          <p>Legendary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who transformed Hollywood's red carpet style and built a global empire on the concept of effortless elegance, has passed away at the age of 91. Armani rose to prominence in the 1980s by dressing stars like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" and pioneering the power suit for both men and women. He strategically used celebrity relationships to turn the once-chaotic red carpet into a high-fashion runway, establishing a model for brand-building that reshaped the industry and cemented his legacy as a titan of 20th-century fashion.</p>

This marks the first time Alcaraz has reached a Grand Slam final without dropping a single set, underscoring his dominant form as he seeks another major title.

          <p>At the Reform UK party conference, leader Nigel Farage seized on the sudden resignation of Labour's Angela Rayner and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle to declare the government is in "deep crisis." Farage delivered an impromptu speech arguing that the instability on the left could lead to an earlier-than-expected general election, urging his party to ramp up campaigning and candidate vetting. He positioned Reform as the party for "decent working people" and pledged to cut benefits and stop illegal immigration, aiming to build on recent local election successes.</p>

          <p>A major scandal is unfolding in Australia after independent testing by a consumer group found that numerous popular sunscreens fail to provide their claimed level of SPF protection. The findings have led to a public backlash, a regulatory probe, and product recalls from brands like Ultra Violette, whose SPF 50+ product tested as low as SPF 4. The controversy in the world's skin cancer capital has shaken consumer trust and raised broader questions about the reliability of sunscreen testing methods and manufacturing standards used by labs and brands globally.</p>

          <p>A vascular surgeon, Neil Hopper, has been jailed for insurance fraud after it was revealed he deliberately froze his own legs to necessitate their amputation, then falsely claimed it was due to sepsis. Hopper, who had a long-standing sexual interest in amputation, deceived medical colleagues, his family, and insurance companies, from which he fraudulently claimed over £466,000. The truth was uncovered during a police investigation into an extreme body modification ring, exposing a complex case of body dysphoria, deception, and criminal activity that had previously been presented as an inspirational story of recovery.</p>

          <p>China's biotechnology industry has made significant strides in closing the innovation gap with the United States, driven by a major regulatory overhaul that began in 2015. The reforms cracked down on fraudulent clinical trial data, forcing a large percentage of pending drug applications to be withdrawn and shifting the industry's focus from generic drugs to genuine innovation. As a result, the quality of clinical data from China has improved dramatically, gaining increased acceptance from international bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, even as new U.S. tariffs loom.</p>

          <p>The latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant cooling of the U.S. economy, with only 22,000 jobs added in August, far below predictions. Furthermore, data for previous months was revised downward, showing a job loss in June, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%. This is the second consecutive month of disappointing labor market data, strengthening concerns about a potential economic downturn, especially as President Trump's tariffs begin to take effect. The weak numbers may, however, increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Her comments come amid her own legal battle with President Trump, who is seeking to remove her from the commission, and after the new FTC Chair, Andrew Ferguson, had previously voiced opposition to the Snap complaint.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration is vacating its previously finalized rule that would have banned most noncompete agreements nationwide. The ban, a key initiative under the Biden administration, was halted by a federal judge before it could take effect. The new FTC leadership has now dismissed its appeal of that ruling, arguing the ban was an illegal overreach of the agency's authority. Instead, the commission plans to pursue a case-by-case enforcement strategy against what it deems to be the most pernicious noncompete agreements that violate existing antitrust laws.</p>

The hiker, Douglas Montgomery, an experienced outdoorsman and former scoutmaster himself, was found dehydrated and disoriented without food, water, or shelter. The troop's scoutmaster, trained in search and rescue, recognized the man's critical situation, provided immediate aid, and used a satellite device to call for a helicopter evacuation.
