          <p>A helicopter crash in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, northern India, resulted in the deaths of all six people on board, including the pilot and a child, prompting an investigation into the cause of the accident. The Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) has dispatched a team to the crash site to determine the reason for the crash, which occurred during a flight from Shri Kedarnath Dham to Guptkashi. This incident follows previous helicopter accidents in the region, raising concerns about helicopter safety in Uttarakhand, a popular tourist and pilgrimage destination. In response, the Chief Minister has directed the preparation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for helicopters, including thorough technical inspections and accurate weather information.

          <p>CBS's "48 Hours" examines the murder of Daniel Green, an Exeter, California police officer, by his ex-wife, Erika Sandoval, and the potential role of a social media post in the crime. Green posted a photo of himself with his new girlfriend on Instagram, which led to a barrage of texts and calls from Sandoval, who then ambushed and shot him in his home. The prosecution argued that the photo was the primary motive for the murder, while Sandoval's defense claimed she was abused by Green and found photos of child pornography on his computer, leading her to fear for their son's safety. Sandoval admitted to the killing but claimed she acted to protect her son, raising questions about whether jealousy or fear motivated the crime. Ultimately, Erika Sandoval was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 50 years to life in May 2025.</p>

          <p>Authorities arrested a suspect in connection with threats made against Texas lawmakers planning to attend the "No Kings" protest at the Texas Capitol in Austin. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) took the suspect into custody during a traffic stop, stating that there is currently no additional active threat. This arrest occurred after DPS warned legislators of a "credible threat" during the protest, leading to the evacuation of the Texas State Capitol and grounds as a precaution. The bulletin to legislators also referenced the targeted attacks against two lawmakers in Minnesota, highlighting the need to take all threats seriously and distinguish between free speech and unlawful threats.</p>

The incident occurred during a nationwide series of protests against President Trump, with tens of thousands participating in Southern California. Mayor Karen Bass, who had earlier pleaded for nonviolence, stated that violence would not be tolerated, and a downtown curfew was enforced.

          <p>A building under construction at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex is suspected of being intended to house advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment, according to a Japanese expert. Yuki Kobayashi from the Sasakawa Peace Foundation suggests that Pyongyang urgently needs such a facility to advance its nuclear program. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi noted the structure's similarities to an existing uranium enrichment plant. The construction, which began in mid-December, was externally completed by early June, and internal construction is ongoing, potentially aimed at enhancing North Korea's capacity for uranium enrichment and miniaturized hydrogen bomb production.</p>

The HCX-23 Plus is designed to be a compact, drone-optimized asset tailored for modern grey-zone and near-sea operations.

          <p>President Trump's long-held ambition for a military parade was realized in Washington D.C., coinciding with his 79th birthday and drawing both supporters and opponents. The parade featured soldiers, tanks, and aircraft, but also sparked "No Kings" protests across the country. The event highlighted the administration's focus on military strength and its controversial deployment of troops to Los Angeles for immigration enforcement. While supporters saw the parade as a celebration of American victories, critics viewed it as a display of authoritarian tendencies. The event took place amid ongoing legal battles and protests over the administration's immigration policies.</p>

The "No Kings" protests were held nationwide to counter President Trump's military parade, with some protests also taking place in Los Angeles, where law enforcement used dispersal tactics after alleged object-throwing.</p>

The goal is to help children communicate their symptoms when they need to miss classes. The team, including students with medical and electronics backgrounds, aims to market the device as medical equipment, seeking private-sector support for further development and clinical testing.</p>
