          <h2>Trump Administration Lifts Sanctions on Syria Amidst Reconstruction Efforts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 14:58:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has lifted sanctions on Syria after 45 years, a move hailed by the Syrian Foreign Ministry as a "pivotal turning point." The decision could bring economic relief and facilitate the return of Syrian refugees, with reconstruction potentially costing between $400 billion and $1 trillion. Trump urged Syria to sign onto the Abraham Accords, remove foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, help prevent the resurgence of ISIS, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers. The lifting of sanctions may also encourage more Syrian refugees to return home, though ensuring protection and socio-economic rights remains crucial for lasting returns.</p>

          <p>Seniors should consider Medicare supplemental insurance to cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, potentially saving money on out-of-pocket expenses. Long-term care insurance can cover costs associated with nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or in-home caretakers, offering financial protection in their golden years. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and provides beneficiaries with funds after death. Prices for these policies generally increase with age, making it wise to research options and secure quotes sooner rather than later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban fluoride in tap water under a law signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, citing concerns about overexposure to fluoride. The move has been met with criticism from dentists and public health advocates, who argue that water fluoridation is a safe and effective way to maintain dental health. Some local governments in Florida, including Miami-Dade County, had already voted to remove fluoride from their water sources prior to the statewide ban. The ban follows a push by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stop fluoridating water.</p>

          <p>A new genetics study traces prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, revealing that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, comparing them to ancient DNA, to understand population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years. The findings also highlight genetic traits that may affect modern South Americans' health and vulnerability to infectious diseases.</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy's CEO Tom Jorden is expected to address investors' concerns after the company's first-quarter earnings report led to a significant stock drop. The company needs to clarify the Harkey incident, where higher-than-expected water volumes were reported at some wells in the Permian Basin, and provide a quick resolution. Investors were also disappointed by the lack of planned share buybacks, as management is prioritizing debt reduction. The company's ability to resolve these issues will be critical in maintaining investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers in Denver lost communications with planes for 90 seconds, forcing them to use backup frequencies, according to the FAA. This incident follows recent outages at a facility near Newark Airport, raising concerns about the air traffic control system. The FAA stated that controllers used another frequency to relay instructions to pilots, and aircraft remained safely separated with no operational impacts. The Trump administration has announced a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul the antiquated air traffic control system.</p>
