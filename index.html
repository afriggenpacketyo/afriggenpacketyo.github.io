          <p>Severe monsoon rains in India's northern state of Himachal Pradesh have resulted in at least 63 fatalities from flooding and related accidents. The torrential downpours and subsequent cloudbursts have caused widespread destruction, including damage to homes and infrastructure, disrupting daily life in several districts. The India Meteorological Department has issued alerts for continued rainfall, while disaster management authorities are focused on rescue and rehabilitation efforts. Officials have linked the extreme weather events to the broader impacts of global warming and climate change on the region.</p>

          <p>A small asteroid that created a bright orange glow and a loud bang over the UK is believed to have scattered fragments across the west Highlands of Scotland. The UK Meteor Network tracked the object, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, as it descended to approximately 12 miles above the ground. While dozens of residents reported the phenomenon, experts note that finding the meteorite pieces will be challenging due to the vast and mountainous terrain. The network has asked hillwalkers to be vigilant for any potential space rocks.</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs has reported that the UK Home Office does not know if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee criticized the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. The report also highlighted widespread evidence of worker exploitation, including debt bondage and excessive hours, accusing the Home Office of being slow to address these issues. The department has faced scrutiny for its management of immigration amid record net migration levels.</p>

          <p>One year after a landslide election win, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Labour Party are facing significant challenges, including plummeting popularity and a struggling economy. Key promises to boost growth have not materialized, with business optimism remaining low and household finances strained by high inflation and borrowing costs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has made several policy U-turns, particularly on welfare, creating a difficult fiscal position. The government has found more success in foreign policy, securing trade deals, but faces a growing domestic threat from the rival Reform UK party.</p>

Prosecutors successfully argued that the woman was incapacitated from heavy drinking and therefore unable to give consent, while the defense had claimed the encounter was consensual.

          <p>Russia has officially become the first country to formally recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. The decision was conveyed by Russia's ambassador in Kabul, a move Afghanistan's Foreign Minister called courageous and a potential example for other nations. Russia, which never closed its embassy after the Taliban's 2021 takeover, stated the recognition would boost bilateral cooperation in areas like energy and security. This development comes despite widespread international condemnation of the Taliban's severe restrictions on human rights, particularly those affecting women and girls.</p>

          <p>A drive-by mass shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and 14 others wounded. Police report that occupants of a dark vehicle opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Authorities believe the shooting was a targeted attack, as some victims were in the rapper's inner circle. The incident has prompted the city to issue a summary closure of the business, and police are increasing their presence to prevent potential retaliatory violence.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have renewed their commitment to tackling the issues of oversupply and 'disorderly low-price competition' within the country's dominant solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting, the Industry and Information Technology Minister urged companies to focus on product quality and support the phasing out of outdated production capacity to ensure sustainable development. This directive follows a similar call from President Xi Jinping to address excess industrial capacity. The move aims to stabilize a key global industry where Chinese manufacturers hold a significant advantage but face internal competitive pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a state that holds an early spot in the Democratic presidential primary calendar, fueling speculation about a 2028 presidential bid. His tour will focus on some of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While Newsom's advisors deny the trip is about a future presidential run, stating his focus is on the 2026 midterms, the visit is seen as an effort to build connections in a politically important region. This follows several other overtures Newsom has made to Southern voters.</p>

To achieve this, the team reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival within the pig embryo before implantation.

The lawmakers argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish a federal agency, a power that belongs to Congress. The move comes after the administration slashed the department's staff and paused over $6 billion in congressionally approved education programs. The brief asserts that these actions violate the separation of powers and threaten access to education for students nationwide.</p>

The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee hike, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permitting.

Critics, including a retired lieutenant colonel, stated this is the type of militarization the nation's founders fought against.

According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently detained by ICE do not have a criminal record. This number has nearly doubled since May, indicating a significant shift in enforcement priorities under the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. Critics argue this contradicts official messaging that focuses on deporting violent criminals, and instead shows a broader crackdown on individuals whose only offense is their immigration status.</p>
