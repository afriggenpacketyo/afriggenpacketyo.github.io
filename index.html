          <p>Over 25 million Americans along the East Coast are under alert for severe weather, including damaging winds, large hail, and potential tornadoes. The storm system, part of an 'omega block pattern,' will bring heavy showers and isolated flash flooding from the Carolinas to New York. On Friday, large hail was reported from Texas to New York, causing downed trees and power lines. The western storm system will move into the central U.S. by Monday, renewing the severe weather and flash flood threat for central Texas, then shifting the flash flooding threat to the Deep South on Tuesday.

          <p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has laid off most of its remaining staff, severely impacting programs related to safety equipment approval, firefighter health, and the World Trade Center Health Program.

Despite HHS claims that essential services will remain intact, laid-off workers describe the department's statements as misleading, expressing concerns about compromised worker safety.

          <p>The discovery of gold coins and jewelry in the Czech Republic, valued at up to $680,000, has prompted a historical investigation to uncover the owner and the reason for its concealment. The treasure, including coins dating back to 1921 and various gold items, was found by hikers in the Krkonose Mountains. Historians are exploring possibilities such as a soldier returning from war, a merchant fleeing conflict, or a wealthy heiress, with the coins' origins spanning across Europe and beyond. The personal objects found alongside the coins may hold the key to solving the mystery.</p>

          <p>Two major US scientific societies, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), are collaborating to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis. This effort follows the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to the National Climate Assessment. The collaboration aims to sustain momentum on climate research and provide science-based support for solutions. The project intends to create a mechanism for ongoing research on the impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>The article examines the Trump administration's deportation policies and whether they violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. It focuses on the administration's practice of deporting individuals to El Salvador and paying for their imprisonment in harsh conditions. While deportation itself is not considered punishment, the article argues that the conditions in El Salvador's prisons could constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The article calls for the Supreme Court to clarify that the government cannot subvert the Bill of Rights by circumventing trials and sentences.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term as Prime Minister, defying expectations and securing a larger parliamentary majority for the Labor Party. The victory came amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration and concerns over the cost of living. Albanese emphasized that Australians had chosen 'to face global challenges the Australian way', distancing himself from international influences. The election saw the defeat of opposition leader Peter Dutton, whose association with Trump's policies may have contributed to his loss.</p>
