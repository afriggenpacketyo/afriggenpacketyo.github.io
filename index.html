          <h2>General Motors to Report Second-Quarter Earnings Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>General Motors is scheduled to release its Q2 earnings, with investors closely watching the financial impact of U.S. auto tariffs and any revisions to the company's full-year guidance. Wall Street anticipates adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share on $46.4 billion in revenue, representing a decline from the previous year. The automaker has already lowered its 2025 earnings forecast to account for a potential $4-5 billion hit from the tariffs. Commentary on the company's electric vehicle strategy is also expected, particularly after recent legislation ended key EV tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization has condemned Israel, stating that its staff residence in Deir al Balah, Gaza, was attacked three times by the Israel Defense Forces. According to the WHO, the Israeli military entered the building, forcing women and children to evacuate on foot while male staff and family members were detained and interrogated at gunpoint. The IDF issued a statement about its military action in the area, noting it had been in contact with international organizations prior to the operation but did not specifically mention the WHO. The situation remains tense and is currently developing.</p>

          <h2>British Medical Association Warns NHS Strike Plans Could Endanger Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:06:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has raised alarms that patient safety is at risk due to NHS England's strategy for the upcoming resident doctors' strike. The union argues that the plan to limit cancellations of routine procedures will overstretch the senior doctors who are providing cover. This approach contrasts with previous strikes where non-urgent care was widely rescheduled to ensure emergency services remained safely staffed. The BMA warns this new policy could lead to last-minute cancellations and potential harm, while talks between the government and the union to avert the strike continue over pay disputes.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly contemplating the use of its Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), a powerful trade tool, in response to the looming threat of a 30% tariff on EU imports by the U.S. The ACI, created in 2023 but never used, allows the EU to restrict market access, public contracts, and investment for a country engaging in economic coercion. This measure is being considered a last resort if a trade deal cannot be reached before the August 1st deadline set by the Trump administration. Analysts suggest the EU would prefer counter-tariffs but may deploy the ACI if trade tensions escalate significantly.</p>

          <p>Grief and anger are growing in Dhaka after a Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school, with the death toll now at 31, including 25 students.

In response, hundreds of students have protested, demanding accountability, compensation for victims, and a halt to training flights using what they call unsafe aircraft. The pilot, who was on his first solo flight, also died in the crash, which is the deadliest in the capital in recent memory.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is emerging as a major political force in Washington, with influence that now reportedly eclipses that of Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang's prominence is tied to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips in the global technology landscape and national security. A recent key development was the U.S. allowing the resumption of some AI chip sales to China, a move Huang had publicly advocated for by arguing that restrictions would harm American tech leadership. His successful lobbying and close engagement with the Trump administration underscore his rising status as a pivotal figure in U.S.-China tech policy.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on Representative Thomas Massie, labeling him "the worst Republican Congressman" in a social media post.

This criticism follows Massie's vote against the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

          <p>New research from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that Democrats could potentially win back a notable portion of Donald Trump's working-class supporters. The analysis indicates that while these voters are often socially moderate, they hold strong 'economic egalitarian' views, supporting policies like a higher minimum wage, job protection, and expanded Social Security. The study identifies that approximately 11% of Trump's working-class base holds this combination of socially moderate and economically progressive views. The author argues that a 'social populist' platform, which embraces this blend of attitudes, could be a viable strategy for Democrats in future elections.</p>

          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe, is being described as an existential threat to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A lower court ruling, if upheld, would strip private citizens and civil rights groups of their ability to sue under the act, leaving enforcement solely to the Department of Justice. Historically, the vast majority of successful Voting Rights Act lawsuits have been brought by private litigants, not the government.

The article critiques the focus on expensive, high-tech weapons systems that often underperform, suggesting this spending fuels an arms race rather than providing effective defense.

          <h2>Scientists Explain Recent Variations in Earth's Rotation Leading to Shorter Days</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 05:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent predictions of slightly shorter days are due to normal, albeit complex, variations in the Earth's rotation speed. Scientists at the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service explain that the planet's spin is influenced by numerous factors, including the moon's gravitational pull, atmospheric winds, and movements in the Earth's liquid core. While the long-term trend is a gradual slowing of the rotation, short-term fluctuations are common. Experts note that while these millisecond-level changes are not significant in themselves, accurately tracking them is crucial for applications like GPS, navigation, and even high-tech farming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report details the intense internal negotiations and political drama within the House Republican conference to pass President Trump's signature 'megabill.' The process involved all-night sessions, last-minute vote changes, and direct negotiations between White House officials and hard-line conservative holdouts, often bypassing House leadership. To secure crucial votes, the Trump administration reportedly made a series of concessions through executive actions and other promises. The saga exposed deep divisions within the GOP and highlighted a dynamic where a small group of members can leverage their votes to extract demands, a pattern that could complicate future legislative efforts.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Together in Manzanar," tells the true story of Elaine Buchman Yoneda, a Jewish American activist who chose to enter the Manzanar concentration camp during WWII with her half-Japanese son, Tommy. When the U.S. government ordered the forced removal of all people of Japanese descent, Elaine faced the choice of sending her ill toddler to the camp alone or joining him. The book details the family's agonizing decision and the desolate, unfit conditions of life inside the camp.

          <p>A Montana man in addiction recovery, identified only as James, has chosen not to report a small pay raise to the state to avoid losing his Medicaid coverage. His income now slightly exceeds the eligibility limit, but he cannot afford private insurance or the prescription drugs that are essential for his stability and ability to work. His situation highlights the "benefit cliff," where a minor increase in earnings can lead to a significant loss of essential aid. This personal story provides a human context to the debate over new Medicaid work requirements, illustrating the difficult choices faced by low-income workers.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration's effort to reduce long wait times on its national 800 number is causing new problems at local field offices. By temporarily reassigning frontline staff to answer phones, the chronically understaffed agency is increasing wait times for other essential services and adding stress to the remaining employees. Union representatives and policy experts argue this is a 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' scenario, a direct result of a declining workforce that has lost thousands of employees. They contend that shuffling staff is not a sustainable solution and that the agency cannot improve overall service without addressing its severe staffing crisis.</p>

          <p>As communities across the U.S. celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), there is a mix of pride in progress and anxiety about the future. The landmark 1990 law brought revolutionary changes in accessibility and rights for people with disabilities. However, many in the disability community are expressing deep concern over pending Medicaid cuts and stricter eligibility requirements included in recent federal legislation. Activists worry these changes could roll back crucial support systems that enable independent living, creating a cloud of uncertainty over the celebrations of this historic milestone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's recent strategy of threatening to veto EU sanctions against Russia is being interpreted by political commentators as a diversionary tactic for domestic audiences. Despite his populist, anti-Brussels rhetoric, Fico ultimately dropped his veto after securing concessions, a move reminiscent of his ally, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban. Analysts in Slovakia suggest the maneuver was a 'show' designed to distract from pressing domestic issues, including a large budget deficit, a structural economic crisis, and ongoing corruption scandals. Fico's government is seen as using external conflicts to deflect from its internal political and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is taking the Trump administration to federal court, arguing that the government illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal funding. The university claims the cuts are a politically motivated retaliation for its rejection of federal demands regarding campus policies on admissions, antisemitism, and diversity. Harvard's lawsuit states the administration is using the funding as leverage to micromanage the institution's academic decisions. The case is being watched closely by other universities facing similar threats, and a ruling in Harvard's favor could restore funding for hundreds of critical scientific and medical research projects.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's new Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated she will likely seek a fresh loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address the country's significant fiscal needs. With global donors having only committed about half of the estimated $75 billion required for the next two years, new financing is critical. This development comes as the country braces for another round of peace talks with Russia in Istanbul, though the Kremlin has downplayed expectations for a breakthrough. Meanwhile, Russian airstrikes continue, with a recent attack in Kramatorsk killing a 10-year-old boy.</p>
