          <p>As the US government seeks a new agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, the Iranian opposition remains divided on the best path forward. While some hope for a diplomatic resolution that eases sanctions and promotes economic openness, others advocate for regime change through foreign intervention or internal revolt. Critics and dissidents face persecution, and the internal rift between the government and the population has grown wider.

          <p>An article discusses the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby foods (UPFs), particularly baby food pouches, and argues that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author argues that the focus on UPFs often overlooks the social, political, and economic factors at play, such as time constraints and the pressure to conform to "intensive mothering" culture. The author advocates for a more supportive society that facilitates good food choices for parents and children, rather than simply condemning convenient options like baby food pouches.
