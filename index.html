          <p>Air Canada is set to restart its flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The strike, which lasted less than 12 hours, had stranded over 100,000 travelers globally during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the workers back, citing economic risks and referring the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for arbitration. The airline anticipates a full return to normal operations will take several days, with some cancellations expected in the interim as it stabilizes its schedule.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but remains a significant threat, with maximum winds of 125 mph. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting considerable flash flood warnings. Forecasters expect Erin to re-intensify after a temporary weakening cycle and turn north, steering between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. While a direct mainland landfall is not anticipated, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along the eastern seaboard.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's continued rejection of a ceasefire is complicating peace negotiations, ahead of his visit to the White House for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. The statement follows a summit where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected without robust security guarantees. Zelenskyy emphasized that stopping the violence is a crucial first step for any meaningful peace process. European leaders are also expected to join the discussions in Washington to coordinate support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Despite a new "one in, one out" agreement between the UK and France, over 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats within the first 11 days of its implementation. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one person with a strong asylum case. However, removals have not yet begun, and critics question the deal's deterrent effect as crossings continue at a high rate, with around 28,000 arrivals this year. The UK government maintains it is committed to breaking the business model of smuggling gangs through enhanced cooperation.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new administration has ordered a significant reduction in radio broadcasts aimed at North Korea in a move intended to de-escalate tensions between the two nations. This policy has sparked criticism and concern, particularly regarding its impact on North Korea's estimated 400,000 underground Christians. For this persecuted community, foreign radio broadcasts are a primary source of religious content and information from the outside world in a country where practicing Christianity is a crime. Critics argue the move harms a vulnerable population by cutting off a vital lifeline of hope and communication.</p>

          <p>A home gardener is raising awareness about the environmental risks posed by Dame's Rocket, a wildflower with beautiful purple blooms that is actually an invasive species. In a widely shared video, she demonstrates the necessity of removing the plants before they seed to prevent them from outcompeting and displacing native flora. This action is crucial for maintaining local biodiversity, as native plants provide essential food and habitat for pollinators like bees and butterflies. The article emphasizes that such individual efforts contribute to healthier ecosystems and inspire broader environmental consciousness.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese universities are under intense online criticism for hosting events with Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The controversy stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X that were critical of Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region. In response to the nationalist backlash, at least three universities, including Central South University, have removed online posts related to the researcher's lectures on unrelated academic topics. The incident underscores the growing challenges for international academic exchange in China amid heightened political sensitivities.</p>

To attract new residents and businesses, authorities rebranded the neighborhood, once known colloquially as "Swampoodle," with the trendier name "NoMa." This naming strategy was part of a broader urban renewal project in the 1990s and 2000s aimed at transforming the area near the city's main railway station. The rebranding effort sought to create an identity similar to other fashionable districts like New York's NoMad or Soho.</p>

The author suggests that against a backdrop of economic inequality, financial stability has become a pragmatic, if unromantic, factor in relationships.

Businesses are motivated to hire older workers as they are often exempt from mandatory social insurance contributions, making them cheaper to employ. This comes as a new Supreme People's Court interpretation, effective next month, will invalidate agreements allowing employees to forgo these contributions.

The essay posits that the ability to be moved by such art is tied to personal growth and an empathy that develops over time.

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is currently hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery. According to the gallery's deputy director, the exhibition is curated to specifically emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and connection to Russian culture. This framing comes as Ukraine has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine when it was part of the Russian Empire, as part of its own national cultural heritage. The exhibition highlights the ongoing cultural and diplomatic ties between China and Russia.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a "targeted enforcement operation" in San Bernardino after the driver allegedly refused to exit and struck two officers. The driver later contacted police, stating that unidentified masked men had shot at him. Local police responded but did not assist with immigration enforcement, citing the California Values Act. A DHS spokesperson criticized the local department for not detaining the man, highlighting tensions between federal and state "sanctuary" policies. The incident, partially captured on video, has drawn criticism from immigrant advocacy groups.</p>
