          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate unexpectedly dropped to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in years.

          <p>Beijing is cautioning other nations against entering trade agreements with the United States that could negatively impact China's economic interests.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a warning about the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), stating that its structure can cause some savers to withdraw less money than they originally invested. The product, designed for first-time home buyers or retirement savings, imposes a penalty for early withdrawals that can erode the saver's own capital. The Treasury Committee highlighted concerns that the complex, dual-purpose nature of the LISA may be unsuitable for many and has been potentially mis-sold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder James Wood achieved a rare baseball feat by being intentionally walked four times in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels. This marks the first time a player has received four intentional passes in one game since Barry Bonds in 2004. Despite the Angels' strategy to pitch around him, Wood managed to go 1-for-2 with a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings. The accomplishment highlights Wood's formidable presence at the plate this season.</p>

          <p>A new book by historian Greg Grandin, "America, AmÃ©rica," suggests the U.S. could learn from the democratic traditions of Latin America. The article highlights how many Latin American independence movements and constitutions were founded on collective ideals and social rights, such as abolishing slavery and guaranteeing a social safety net, concepts not explicitly central to the U.S. Constitution. While acknowledging the region's history of political instability, often fueled by U.S. intervention, the analysis posits that Latin America's focus on "the common good" offers a valuable counter-narrative to current political trends in the United States.</p>

          <p>As life expectancy increases, a growing number of adults are finding themselves in the "club sandwich generation," simultaneously caring for their parents, children, and grandchildren. This phenomenon extends the concept of the "sandwich generation" to families with four living generations, a structure that is becoming increasingly common. While having great-grandparents provides families with a valuable connection to their history, it places immense strain on the middle generation, who are often seniors themselves, to provide care without adequate societal or policy support.</p>

This information was then used by the cartel to identify, intimidate, and in some cases, kill potential witnesses and sources cooperating with U.S. law enforcement.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing for a marathon voting session on a massive tax and spending package central to the Republican agenda. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. With a slim majority, Republican leaders are working to secure enough votes to pass the legislation through the reconciliation process, while Democrats plan to force votes on numerous amendments to highlight controversial aspects of the bill ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>An Iranian official has stated that before any new negotiations can occur, the United States must provide clear assurances that it will not repeat its recent military aggression against Iran. This demand follows a recent conflict where the U.S. bombed three of Iran's nuclear sites. The deputy foreign minister, Takht-Ravanchi, told the BBC that while Iran is open to dialogue, it needs confidence that it won't be attacked while engaging in diplomacy. He also reiterated Iran's insistence on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.</p>

          <p>UEFA has postponed its decision on whether Crystal Palace will be allowed to compete in next season's Europa League. The club's eligibility is in question due to multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified. The situation is complicated by Lyon's recent demotion to Ligue 2 for financial reasons, a decision they are currently appealing. UEFA will await the outcome of Lyon's appeal before ruling on Crystal Palace's fate.</p>

          <p>Cities in the American Sun Belt, once a refuge from high housing costs, are now experiencing sharp price increases, mirroring the affordability crisis of coastal cities like San Francisco and New York. While these regions continue to build more housing in absolute terms, the rate of new construction has fallen significantly over the past 25 years. Analysts argue that as these cities run out of room for suburban sprawl and become more affluent, resident opposition to new development, or NIMBYism, has intensified, creating a national housing shortage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, understanding dogs requires recognizing that their primary sense is smell. Unlike humans who are visual creatures, dogs construct their reality from olfactory information, which is constantly in motion and changes over time. Horowitz suggests that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that map their world. This olfactory perception even shapes their sense of time, as the fading scent of a person allows them to register their absence.</p>

          <p>The retirement of Republican Senator Thom Tillis has made his North Carolina seat significantly more vulnerable for the GOP in the upcoming election. Tillis, who faced increasing pressure from the MAGA wing of his party, was already in a precarious position in a narrowly divided state. His departure removes the advantage of incumbency and opens the door to a potentially messy Republican primary. Combined with North Carolina's demographic shift toward the center, this development improves Democrats' chances of flipping a key Senate seat.</p>

          <p>The federal trial of music mogul Sean Combs is nearing its conclusion, with the jury expected to begin deliberations on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. Prosecutors have depicted Combs as the leader of a criminal enterprise that used violence, threats, and drugs to coerce women into sex acts. The defense has argued that while Combs' behavior was reprehensible, the charges are exaggerated and do not meet the legal requirements for a conviction. The case hinges on graphic testimony from multiple accusers, including his former partner Cassie Ventura.</p>

          <p>A Chinese government-backed foundation has announced a project to use artificial intelligence to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, including those starring Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. The plan, which includes creating new animated versions of the movies, highlights a starkly different approach to AI in entertainment compared to Hollywood, where the technology is met with deep suspicion from creative guilds. The Directors Guild of America strongly opposed the idea, stating AI should never be used to alter a filmmaker's original work, while Bruce Lee's estate was unaware of the project.</p>
