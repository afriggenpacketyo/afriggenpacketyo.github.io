        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison sentence, concluding that his extended stay in a hospital instead of a jail cell was unlawful. After returning to Thailand in 2023 from 15 years of self-imposed exile, his original eight-year sentence for corruption was commuted to one year by a royal pardon. However, he spent nearly all of that time in a luxury hospital wing, prompting a legal challenge. The ruling is another significant setback for the influential Shinawatra political dynasty, which has dominated Thai politics for decades.</p>

          <p>During a virtual BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged partner nations, particularly China, to address significant trade imbalances that are unfavorable to New Delhi. This call for review came as China's President Xi Jinping encouraged the bloc to unite against what he termed "hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism," a veiled reference to U.S. trade policies under President Trump. India's trade deficit with China reached a record high of $99.21 billion, highlighting differing priorities within the economic alliance as it navigates global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has publicly released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a 238-page "birthday book" compiled for his 50th birthday in 2003. The book contains messages from numerous high-profile individuals, most notably a page with a signature resembling Donald Trump's, which the White House has vehemently denied is authentic. The release has intensified scrutiny of the former president's past association with the convicted sex offender. The documents, which also include Epstein's will, were obtained by the committee via a subpoena to the estate's executors.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement action in Chicago, named "Operation Midway Blitz," aimed at targeting individuals described as "criminal illegal aliens." The move has drawn sharp criticism from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who stated they received no prior notice and condemned the action as a political stunt intended to stoke fear. City officials expressed opposition to what they term "militarized immigration enforcement," citing concerns over potential constitutional and human rights violations based on past ICE operations.</p>

          <p>Rookie quarterback JJ McCarthy led the Minnesota Vikings to a 27-24 comeback victory against the Chicago Bears in his highly anticipated NFL debut. After a challenging first three quarters, the former Michigan star threw for two touchdowns and ran for another in the final quarter to secure the win. The game marked a promising start for McCarthy, who was drafted with the 10th pick in 2024 but missed his initial rookie season with a knee injury. His clutch performance turned the tide after a Chicago interception return for a touchdown had given the Bears a significant lead.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against parent company Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" that potentially compromise user privacy. The suit claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data without adequate tracking, posing a significant security risk. The plaintiff, Attaullah Baig, also alleges that Meta retaliated against him with negative performance reviews and eventual termination after he reported these concerns to senior leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Meta has disputed the claims, attributing the dismissal to poor performance.</p>

          <p>Vancouver-based startup Jetson is working to make home electrification more affordable by significantly reducing the upfront cost of heat pump installations. Using a direct-to-consumer model that combines proprietary software and hardware, the company claims its average installation cost is around $15,000, which is 30% to 50% below typical quotes. Jetson recently launched its own heat pump, the Jetson Air, to further control costs. By factoring in available rebates, the company says it can offer installations for as little as $5,000, making it financially competitive with traditional gas furnace and air conditioner systems.</p>

With nominations opening on a tight timetable, the election is expected to highlight internal party divisions and debates over the government's direction.

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been rated and ranked in new public league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The government stated the new system is designed to increase transparency, identify underperforming trusts that need support, and end a "postcode lottery" in care quality. However, the initiative has drawn criticism from NHS Providers, who question whether the chosen metrics accurately measure performance and worry the rankings could demoralize staff and damage patient confidence in local services.</p>

          <h2>Ofsted to Implement 'Report Card' School Inspections Despite Criticism</h2>

          <p>England's education regulator, Ofsted, has confirmed it will move forward with a new "report card" system for school inspections, replacing its controversial one- or two-word grading scale. The change follows the suicide of a head teacher, which a coroner linked to the stress of an inspection. Despite this context, the new multi-category grading system has faced strong criticism from a coalition of school leaders and campaigners, who argue it is a cosmetic rebranding that continues to pose a significant risk to the mental health and wellbeing of educators.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court order lifting a temporary ban on certain federal immigration tactics has sparked fear and anger across immigrant communities in Los Angeles. The ruling allows agents to resume stops that a lower court found were likely based on racial profiling, such as targeting people for their appearance or language. In response, the Department of Homeland Security announced its intent to "FLOOD THE ZONE," prompting concerns among residents and advocacy groups about a new wave of aggressive raids, potential family separations, and a climate of pervasive dread.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023. As cannabis becomes legal in more states for both medical and recreational purposes, the associated stigma is diminishing, leading many seniors to explore it for managing conditions like chronic pain and anxiety. While users report therapeutic benefits, some medical professionals express caution, warning that THC, the main psychoactive compound, may carry cardiovascular health risks regardless of how it is consumed.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill aimed at shutting down the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills by banning online brokers and other middlemen from selling dogs to California consumers. The legislation, AB 519, targets deceptive practices where resellers pose as small, local breeders while actually sourcing animals from large-scale commercial breeding facilities. If signed into law by the governor, the bill will close a loophole left by a 2019 law that banned pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs but did not cover the rapidly growing online sales market.</p>
