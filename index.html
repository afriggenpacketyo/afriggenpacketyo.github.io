        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overnight Russian attacks across Ukraine resulted in at least seven deaths and 27 injuries, with the Ukrainian air force reporting the interception of 75 out of 112 launched drones. The majority of fatalities occurred in the northeastern regions near the front lines, with a cluster rocket attack in Sumy causing three deaths and 20 injuries, while shelling in the Kharkiv region led to three more deaths and six injuries. President Zelenskyy stated that the ongoing attacks demonstrate Putin's lack of genuine interest in peace, despite U.S.-brokered talks, emphasizing the need for global pressure to achieve a ceasefire, and Ukraine continues its own long-range strike campaign into Russia. This highlights the continued volatility and human cost of the conflict. Optimism regarding a swift resolution remains low given the persistent violence. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The classification of the multi-billion pound Oxford-Cambridge rail line as an "England and Wales project" has sparked anger, as it means Wales will not receive additional funding despite the line not running through the country. Critics, including Liberal Democrat MP David Chadwick, have likened the situation to HS2, where Wales also missed out on funding, and the TSSA union has called for a rethink, arguing the classification undermines trust and deprives Welsh communities of needed rail investment. Welsh government Transport Secretary Ken Skates noted the historical disadvantage Wales faces in rail funding, and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts deemed the classification "absurd," emphasizing the project's lack of benefit to Wales. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about fair allocation of infrastructure funding across the UK. </p>

          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has rejected a substantial offer from Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal, despite considering the deal which would have more than doubled his current salary. After discussing the matter with his family, Fernandes informed Al-Hilal of his decision to remain with Manchester United, where he has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals since joining in January 2020. Manchester United is reportedly pleased with Fernandes' decision, particularly after head coach Ruben Amorim expressed confidence in Fernandes staying at Old Trafford. It remains uncertain whether Al-Hilal will now pursue alternative targets following Fernandes' rejection. </p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is implementing performance metrics for American ambassadors in Africa, evaluating them based on the number of business deals they facilitate as part of a new "trade, not aid" strategy. The Trump administration has secured 33 deals worth US$6 billion within its first 100 days through this approach, which focuses on countries where U.S. companies are keen to invest. This commercial diplomacy strategy coincides with overhauls to USAID, suspension of foreign aid, and imposition of trade tariffs, marking a shift from traditional aid-based engagement. The U.S. aims to host another US-Africa Leaders Summit, following President Biden's pledge to invest US$55 billion in Africa over three years during the 2022 summit. </p>

          <p>The Klein Vision AirCar, a flying car decades in development, is nearing reality with certification expected later this year and customer deliveries planned for early 2026. This vehicle transforms from a road-legal sports coupe to an aircraft in about 80 seconds, requiring a runway for takeoff and landing, and offers a range of up to 620 miles in the air. It will be available with three engine options and will require both a driver's license and a private pilot's license to operate. Priced between $800,000 and $1.2 million, the AirCar targets wealthy travelers and air taxi services, with plans for future models including versions with more seats and an amphibious variant. </p>

          <p>The far right is attempting to disseminate ideologically charged material as art through the publishing world, with Passage Press now part of Foundation Publishing Group, and this group is connected to Network Press, whose only title is an "accelerationist" manifesto by Marc Andreessen. Another rightwing publisher, Ark Press, appears connected to Chapter House, which Lisi co-founded as an independent publisher but now presents itself as a homeschooling resource, and these developments highlight efforts to advance reactionary values via genre fiction. Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism sees this as another front in the culture wars, pushing America further from democracy and equality, and Passage Press publishes authors with far-right views. The effort is to mainstream far-right writers by selling their work, offering high-end editions, and convening public events. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is marked by frequent policy reversals and instability, especially in trade and foreign policy, and this "un-happening" affects media, immigration, science, and education policy. The administration's claims to monarchical power are a threat to Americaâ€™s constitutional order, but its executive orders and policy feints are so haphazard and poorly articulated that they amount to a kind of autocratic takeover written in smudge-able crayon. This inconsistency can be seen as both a superpower and a weakness, allowing Trump to bend the Constitution while claiming anything extreme is provisional, but businesses prefer certainty over disappearing promises and threats. The substantive problem with the MAGA agenda isnâ€™t just that too much is happening for any median voter to follow; itâ€™s that too much is un-happening for employers, investors, and consumers to know what the hell to do about it. </p>

Several cited sources do not exist, and HHS reissued the report with some citations removed without disclosing the changes, and the report falsely asserts that today's children are the sickest generation in American history. Hiltzik argues that the report ignores social determinants of disease and potential budget cuts to safety net programs, and he criticizes the decision to remove COVID boosters from the CDC's list of recommended vaccinations for healthy children and pregnant women. The report is seen as a blueprint for attacking public health, and the author warns that the report will subject the health of American children to the greatest risk they've faced in American history. </p>

The book features black-and-white images of old adobe structures alongside Italianate buildings and homes on steep hillsides, accompanied by Hylen's essay documenting the city's cultural erasure. Marsak augmented the edition with additional text, notes, and previously unpublished photos, and Hylen, who photographed the city during World War II, aimed to chronicle the disappearing downtown area, especially Bunker Hill. Marsak hopes the book will inspire Angelenos to appreciate their city's history and consider preservation efforts. </p>

          <p>A columnist argues that the sloppiness of the Department of Homeland Security's "sanctuary jurisdiction list" is intentional, reflecting the Trump administration's obsession with immigration. The list contains numerous errors, such as including Huntington Beach, a city that opposes sanctuary status, while omitting Santa Ana, which has declared itself a sanctuary city, and the columnist points out that the administration's focus on deportation overshadows accuracy and disregards human lives. The flaws exemplify an administration willing to overlook mistakes in pursuit of its immigration agenda, and the columnist suggests that the pushback against the list's errors has been swift and critical. The author urges vigilance and awareness of the administration's actions. </p>

These requirements often provide a push and support network for individuals needing assistance entering the job market, and America Works, a job agency, assigns counselors to help participants with job placement and retention. While some participants may drop out due to personal challenges, those who maintain employment often gain confidence and structure in their lives, and the proposed Medicaid work rules exclude individuals with disabilities, mental health conditions, and adults with young children.

The search involves 30 German police officers and is focused on 21 plots of land between the Ocean Club resort and where BrÃ¼ckner had been staying, and officials have not disclosed if they are conducting this latest search in Portugal based on any new information. This effort appears to be a final look in places where evidence or a body could have been hidden. </p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that many market participants consider continued reductions in government bond purchases appropriate as the central bank normalizes its policy after a decade of easing. During a mid-May meeting, Ueda noted limited calls to revise the current reduction plan through March 2026, and the BOJ is scheduled to discuss the purchase reduction at its next policy meeting. In a parliamentary session, Ueda mentioned the BOJ would not push to raise its policy rate unless economic and price conditions improve, citing uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. The BOJ has raised its key interest rate three times since March last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to the impact of President Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook has been revised down to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, citing tariff policy, economic policy uncertainty, reduced immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. Global growth is also expected to be lower, with the slowdown concentrated in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the OECD warns that increased trade barriers, tighter financial conditions, and heightened policy uncertainty will negatively affect growth prospects. OECD Chief Economist Alvaro Pereira stated that trade uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty have reached unprecedented levels. (not investment advice)</p>

The move will likely trigger snap elections, and ministers are expected to convene for an emergency meeting, with Prime Minister Schoof likely to offer the resignation of the cabinet to King Willem-Alexander.

          <p>Jodie Marsh has won a court case against Uttlesford District Council, allowing her to keep lemurs at her private animal sanctuary, Fripps Farm, after the council refused her application for a wild animal license. The judge criticized the council for contradictory views and going against reports stating Marsh was a suitable keeper, and concerns had been raised about her taking a meerkat from her farm to the pub. Marsh, who founded the sanctuary in 2020, took the council to court after it did not allow her to adopt eight ring-tailed lemurs, and neighbors voiced opposition against her. The judge ordered the local authority to pay her Â£19,641 in costs. </p>

The mainland market for fresh-made beverages is projected to grow rapidly, reaching 1 trillion yuan in sales by 2027, but the competitive spending and strains could pressure margins and dim growth prospects. Shares in beverage chains lacking a clear competitive edge have already seen investor confidence decline, and since 2021, Chinese fresh-drink brands have raised over US$2.5 billion via IPOs or private-equity funding rounds. Investor confidence quickly tumbled for beverage chains that lacked a clear edge in the fiercely competitive industry, where supply-chain capacity is of paramount importance. </p>

Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, claiming the line belonged to a licensed fisherman, but the pardons erase those convictions. The men had been ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting in Florida, owning firearms and traveling freely outside the U.S. </p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's foreign policy in his second term reveals a shift in focus and approach, as he appears to have initially shown little interest in regions like Gaza and Ukraine, but is now developing a more defined "America First" strategy. There is a shift from an interventionist approach to a more transactional one, emphasizing American interests and potentially leading to significant realignments in international relations. The policy is being shaped by domestic priorities and a desire to reduce American involvement in foreign conflicts, however the success of this approach remains uncertain.
