          <p>As missile exchanges continue between Israel and Iran, European leaders are seeking clarity from Donald Trump regarding his Iran strategy at the G7 summit. Trump suggested that the parties may need to "fight it out" before a deal can be reached, showing a lack of urgency in de-escalating the conflict. The ongoing conflict has led to the cancellation of planned US talks with Iran on its civil nuclear program. Trump's remarks echo his past claims of quickly resolving international conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones due to concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light. Some projects have been canceled due to local opposition, highlighting the tensions between tech companies' need for data storage and processing facilities and residents' quality of life. Municipalities are beginning to implement regulations to address these concerns, such as requiring early construction announcements and clearly indicating the location of heat-emitting units. Industry groups are working to improve relations between locals and data center operators to build trust and mitigate anxiety.</p>

He also intends to address Trump's tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum, which Australia views as economically harmful.

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, increasing by 6.4% year-on-year in May, surpassing analysts' estimates. The growth was partly attributed to the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8% year-on-year, and fixed-asset investment also saw a deceleration.

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations in cities run by Democrats, amidst growing resistance in Los Angeles and other major US cities. Trump called on officials to "do all in their power" to achieve the goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History. He claimed that Democrats use undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base, cheat in elections, and grow the welfare state. The order comes after "No Kings" protests broke out across the United States, criticizing several Trump policies.</p>

Researchers have successfully extended the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years at a brightness comparable to commercial displays, addressing a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. The team's PeLEDs reached a brightness of 1.16 million nits, surpassing the brightest commercial screens, and exhibited a theoretical lifespan of over 185,000 hours at 100 nits.
