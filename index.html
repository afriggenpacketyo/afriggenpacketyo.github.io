          <p>An aid agency reports dire conditions in Sudan, with people resorting to eating charcoal and leaves to survive after fleeing attacks on displacement camps near El-Fasher. The Norwegian Refugee Council's head of operations described horrific stories of people dying of thirst while trying to reach Tawila and bodies remaining on the road. One particularly harrowing account detailed a girl who died from wounds sustained after being repeatedly subjected to sexual assault during her journey. The RSF denies committing atrocities despite attacking the Zamzam camp.</p>

Santos admits to exaggerating and fabricating parts of his backstory to enrich himself and capture one of the highest offices.
