          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is on the verge of a forceful entry into Gaza, following security cabinet approval for deploying thousands of additional soldiers and relocating Palestinians to the south. Netanyahu stated the move aims to escalate pressure on Hamas to release hostages and dismantle the group's infrastructure. Critics, including opposition leaders and hostage families, expressed concerns that the intensified military campaign would endanger the hostages and fail to fundamentally alter the conflict's dynamics. The plan includes holding territories indefinitely to prevent Hamas from regaining control, though officials deny intentions of permanent occupation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced a program offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who voluntarily depart the United States for their countries of origin. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest and most cost-effective way for immigrants to leave the U.S. to avoid arrest. Participants must use the CBP Home app and will receive the stipend upon confirmed arrival in their home country, while also being deprioritized for detention and removal during their departure process. The administration argues that this program is a more dignified and economical approach compared to forced deportations.</p>

The trial is expected to last two months and will include sexually explicit evidence, including a surveillance tape showing Combs assaulting then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who is expected to testify along with other alleged victims.

          <p>Five people, including a young boy, survived a plane crash in the Bolivian jungle and endured a 36-hour ordeal clinging to wreckage in a lagoon filled with alligators and anacondas.

Rescuers eventually found them after they waved shirts and used cell phone flashlights to signal for help.

South Africa is home to the largest rhino population in the world, but the demand for rhino horn on the black market, particularly in Asia, continues to fuel poaching activities.

          <p>The Trump Administration announced it will pay immigrants in the US illegally $1,000 to self deport. President Donald Trump is set to make a major "sports announcement" and also meet with Ksenia Karelina, a freed U.S.-Russian dual citizen who was imprisoned in Russia. On Sunday, the president said that he doesn't know if he is supposed to uphold the Constitution and relies on his lawyers to follow the law.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the "capture" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a "forceful operation" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population "will be moved, to protect it". The cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has shrunk the economy, and his tariffs have sent both the stock market and consumer confidence tumbling. Republicans in Congress could soon make things much worse. GOP leaders are struggling to reconcile deep divisions as they try to pass Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” which encompasses the bulk of his domestic agenda. The plan revolves around his 2017 tax cuts; Republicans want to permanently extend them before they expire at the end of the year, but they can’t agree on how to cover the more than $5 trillion price tag—or whether to cover it at all.</p>
