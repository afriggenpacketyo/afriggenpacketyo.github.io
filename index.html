          <p>Thousands participated in "Hands Off!" demonstrations across the United States, protesting President Trump and Elon Musk's policies concerning government downsizing, the economy, and human rights. The rallies, organized by over 150 groups, targeted the administration's actions, including federal worker layoffs, Social Security office closures, immigration policies, and funding cuts for health programs. Musk, heading the Department of Government Efficiency, defended his role in downsizing as saving taxpayer money. Protesters criticized the administration for prioritizing profit and power over the well-being of working people and communities, expressing concerns about the impact on economic security and social safety nets.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans passed a budget resolution after an overnight voting session, advancing President Trump's agenda on border security, defense, energy, and tax cuts. The resolution aims to make Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent, authorize additional tax cuts, and raise the debt ceiling. Democrats opposed the plan, offering amendments on issues like Medicaid and Social Security. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent praised the budget as strengthening the economy, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for pretending their tax cuts are "free."</p>

Jackson filed trademark registrations for "ERA 8" and "ERA 8 BY LAMAR JACKSON" back in 2019, while Earnhardt Jr. is now attempting to trademark the number itself, stylized in the fashion it was on his car. Jackson argues that Earnhardt's application conflicts with his own trademarks and could cause him damage, falsely suggesting a connection between the two.

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the visas of international students at several California universities, including UCLA, UC San Diego, and Stanford. The reasons for the revocations are unclear, but they are part of a broader pattern of visa cancellations at campuses across the country. University officials are providing support to the affected students. Some believe the revocations are targeting pro-Palestinian activists, while others suggest there may be other violations on their records.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's tariffs loom, some U.S. consumers are rushing to buy goods before prices increase. However, experts caution against going into debt to beat the tariffs, advising consumers to buy only what they can afford. While some stocking up may make sense, they emphasize the importance of considering long-term financial situations. Experts do not anticipate widespread shortages but recommend a measured approach to avoid panic buying.</p>

Each film will focus on an individual member, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of their distinct identities. The project is a first, as all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film. The casting choices are strategic, as the actors have younger fan bases and acting credibility.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are criticizing President Trump's tariff formula, arguing that it misrepresents global trade economics. They claim that the formula, which is based on the trade deficit divided by imports, is flawed and does not align with modern economic principles. Experts argue that the formula is unlikely to yield the results the administration is seeking. They emphasize that trade deficits are determined by financial markets, not just import demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are impacting the availability and price of Korean beauty products in the United States. A 25% tariff on goods imported from South Korea, along with the repeal of a customs loophole, is causing price hikes and potential supply disruptions. The tariffs will test the strength of the K-beauty brand in America, and American consumers may have to decide whether the benefits of these products outweigh the increased cost. Some Korean companies may choose to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. to avoid the tariffs, but that could cause them to lose their unique allure.</p>
