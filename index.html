          <p>A federal judge in Boston is considering whether non-citizens in the United States have the same free speech protections as U.S. citizens, particularly in a case involving the Trump administration's revocation of foreign student visas. The judge suggested that it is "not clear" that non-citizens have the "full rights to free speech" as citizens, which could have implications for pro-Palestinian activists facing deportation. The case involves accusations that the Trump administration is suppressing First Amendment rights on university campuses, with the government denying these claims. The court aims to determine whether the government has committed any "retribution" against people for their speech, potentially creating a chilling effect.</p>

While the initiative has garnered support from Hollywood unions and industry groups, it faces significant obstacles, including political optics and competition from other national priorities.

          <p>Mattel is considering raising prices on toys in the U.S. due to the 145% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese imports. CEO Ynon Kreiz stated that the company is taking mitigating actions to offset the potential cost impact. This decision follows President Trump's suggestion that children can reduce the number of toys they have. Mattel is also diversifying its manufacturing locations to reduce reliance on China, estimating that the tariffs could cost the company $270 million this year. (not investment advice)</p>
