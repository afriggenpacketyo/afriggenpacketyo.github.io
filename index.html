          <p>The Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 114-109 in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, taking a 2-0 series lead. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a playoff career-high 39 points, supported by Myles Turner's 16 points and Tyrese Haliburton's near triple-double. Despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks, the Pacers' strong fourth-quarter performance and effective bench play secured the victory, marking their sixth consecutive playoff road win. The Knicks struggled with turnovers and defensive communication, facing a daunting task to reverse the series on the road.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country to alleviate pressure on accident and emergency departments.

The goal is to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, avoiding long waits in A&E. While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model, critics emphasize the need for proper funding and rigorous testing before national rollout, citing concerns about separating physical and mental health problems.</p>

European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be detrimental, advocating for negotiations as the sustainable way forward.

The Welsh government acknowledges the need for improved diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD. Doctors emphasize the importance of tracking symptoms and considering treatment options like CBT and antidepressants, while balancing the pros and cons of coming off contraception.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms to ease the burden on consumers amid soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores as early as June. This move comes amid mounting criticism of the government's failure to curb the spike in rice prices, which is hurting households as inflation outpaces wage growth.

          <p>Germany's claim of reckoning with its Nazi past is often selective, embraced when it enhances its self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. Despite efforts to confront the past, the Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an SS supporter, continues to be awarded, highlighting a refusal to confront societal entanglement with state violence and genocide. Streets still bear the names of colonial administrators, and the government refuses to pay reparations to the descendants of genocide victims in Namibia.
