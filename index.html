          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Glastonbury Festival organizers have condemned punk duo Bob Vylan for leading "appalling" chants of "death to the IDF" during their performance. The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service. The incident has sparked widespread criticism from government officials, with Health Secretary Wes Streeting calling the remarks "revolting." Avon and Somerset Police are now reviewing footage from the performance to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered new evacuations in northern Gaza, specifically in parts of Gaza City and Jabalia, as it intensifies its operations in the region. Recent Israeli attacks have resulted in at least 86 Palestinian deaths in a 24-hour period, including three children killed in a strike on a designated "safe zone." This escalation occurs as mediators, with encouragement from U.S. President Donald Trump, renew efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal. However, negotiations remain stalled, and humanitarian agencies continue to condemn the conditions surrounding aid distribution.</p>

          <p>An early morning explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in the collapse of three rowhomes, killing one person and injuring two others. Officials are conducting a slow, methodical investigation to determine the cause and prevent any secondary collapses of adjacent damaged buildings. Mayor Cherelle Parker has visited the affected families and urged the public to support them through the city's One Philly Fund. The American Red Cross and Salvation Army are on site, assisting dozens of displaced residents who have been evacuated as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Commissioner, expressed concern over the direction of U.S. public health policy under the second Trump administration, particularly the politicization of vaccine guidance. Speaking on "Face the Nation," he criticized the reconstitution of the vaccine advisory committee (ACIP) with members who lack deep scientific experience, calling it a "political process." Gottlieb warned that efforts to restrict vaccine access, driven by Health Secretary Kennedy, are expanding beyond COVID-19 and could undermine public trust and stifle innovation in vaccine science.

          <p>A recent opinion piece argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. China controls over 90% of the global refining capacity and has demonstrated its willingness to weaponize this dominance by restricting exports. Despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to build a secure, independent supply chain, leaving its commercial and defense sectors exposed to disruption and competitive surveillance. The article calls for a coherent, long-term national strategy to treat these minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia strongly criticized the Republican-led tax and spending bill, labeling it a "political albatross" for the GOP. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Warner warned that the legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts while reducing funds for healthcare and nutrition programs, will significantly increase the national debt by nearly $3.3 trillion over a decade. He argued that despite some potentially popular provisions like an expanded Child Tax Credit, the bill's negative impacts on social safety nets and rural communities will ultimately "come back and bite" Republicans.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of "Love Island USA" has been accompanied by intense cyberbullying of its contestants, prompting the show to issue on-air pleas for viewers to stop the harassment. This article explores the dark side of reality TV fame, drawing parallels to the UK version of the franchise, which faced parliamentary inquiry after the deaths of former contestants. While producers say they have improved mental health support and duty-of-care protocols, psychologists note the inherent conflict between protecting contestants and producing dramatic television. The piece questions whether US productions have evolved as much as their UK counterparts in addressing these welfare concerns.</p>

          <p>LeBron James will make NBA history by becoming the first person to play 23 seasons in the league. The Lakers superstar exercised his $52.6 million player option to return to the team for the 2025-26 season, as confirmed by his agent. At 40 years old, James breaks his tie with Vince Carter for the most seasons played and is also approaching Robert Parish's record for the most regular-season games played. This decision solidifies a key piece of the Lakers' roster as the team looks to address other needs in free agency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is considering forcing journalists to reveal their sources for reports on a classified intelligence assessment of recent U.S. strikes on Iran. In a Fox News interview, Trump threatened prosecution for both the reporters and their sources, reiterating his attacks on CNN and The New York Times for their "unpatriotic" coverage. The leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report suggested the strikes had only a limited, temporary impact on Iran's nuclear program, contradicting the administration's claims that the facilities were "obliterated."</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated boxing rematch between British fighters Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn has been scheduled for September 20 in London. The fight follows their thrilling April bout, which Eubank Jr won by unanimous decision. That first encounter, held 35 years after their famous fathers first fought, was marked by a contentious build-up, including a cancelled 2022 fight due to a failed drug test by Benn. Promoter Eddie Hearn noted the rematch is even bigger than the first sell-out event, with a venue like Wembley Stadium being considered.</p>

Despite its strong start and positive "A" CinemaScore from audiences, the film's reported $200 million-plus budget means it still has a long road to profitability, but it represents a significant theatrical success for Apple.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma stated that he believes children born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents should be deported along with them. His comments on NBC's "Meet the Press" came in response to questions about a recent Supreme Court decision that allows President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship to take effect in some states. When asked what should happen to these U.S. citizen children, Mullin argued against separating families, stating, "they should go where their parents are." This position challenges the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to roll back federal energy efficiency regulations, including potentially eliminating the popular Energy Star program. Following executive orders targeting rules for appliances like dishwashers, light bulbs, and toilets, the Department of Energy and the EPA are reviewing or rescinding dozens of standards. This has prompted a mixed reaction, with deregulation advocates cheering the move while consumer and environmental groups warn of higher utility bills and a "buyer beware" marketplace. Appliance manufacturers also express concern, particularly over the potential loss of federal preemption of state-level regulations, which could create a patchwork of conflicting standards.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, mistakenly notified "several thousand" Eurojackpot players that they had won millions of kroner. The error was caused by a faulty currency conversion from Eurocents to Norwegian kroner, which multiplied the prize amounts by 100 instead of dividing. The company corrected the amounts the next day and confirmed no incorrect payouts were made, but the mistake led to widespread anger and disappointment. The CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, has since apologized for the "breach of trust" and resigned from her position following the incident.</p>

However, the Trump administration has signaled its intent to roll back this and other monument designations to open land for energy development.
