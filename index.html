          <p>Japan remains at 118th place out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap rankings, the lowest among G7 nations, due to limited political participation by women, according to the World Economic Forum. The report shows Japan improved women's participation in the economic arena but ranks low in political empowerment, reflecting the scarcity of female government ministers and the absence of a female prime minister. While the world has seen improvements in women's economic participation and political empowerment, full parity is estimated to take 123 years. Japan's progress in narrowing the gender gap has been slow, scoring marginally higher than in 2006. </p>

          <p>President Trump's nuclear strategy is taking shape as the U.S. aims to dominate the AI race against China by powering AI data centers with nuclear energy. The first phase of a new uranium enrichment facility opened in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign uranium. Trump signed executive orders to quadruple domestic nuclear energy production by 2050, while China plans to build 100 new nuclear reactors by 2035. The U.S. seeks to streamline nuclear energy production to compete with China's rapid expansion in the sector, recognizing the increasing energy demands of AI data centers.</p>

          <p>A strip club in Kharkiv, Ukraine, has become a refuge for soldiers seeking solace from the ongoing war. Dancers at the Flash Dancers club provide comfort and act as confidantes to traumatized troops, offering an escape from the harsh realities of the conflict. Many soldiers share their experiences and feelings with the dancers, sometimes showing them videos from the battlefield. Despite the club's attempts to maintain boundaries, the war inevitably seeps in, with dancers often taking gifts to wounded soldiers and mourning those who have been killed. </p>

          <p>The United States is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Baghdad, citing heightened security risks amid rising tensions with Iran. This decision follows reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, leading the U.S. to advise some Americans to leave the region due to potential retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. These actions come as U.S. talks regarding Iran's nuclear program have stalled, with President Trump expressing diminishing confidence in Iran's commitment to halt uranium enrichment. The U.S. State Department stated that it is constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all embassies and decided to reduce the mission's footprint in Iraq based on its latest analysis. </p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, as part of the Aukus security pact, to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This trilateral pact, aimed at countering China's growing influence, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the US and the allies sharing advanced technology. While Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, it reflects pressure from the White House for increased military spending. The review raises concerns about the US's commitment to the deal and potential shifts in the security pact's focus.</p>

This decline follows a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, sparked by disagreements over spending bills. Despite the dip in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans after his time running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an effort to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. </p>

          <p>Chris Mason, BBC's Political Editor, analyzes the recent Spending Review, highlighting the government's willingness to prioritize long-term investments over short-term gains. The government is betting on capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential, while limiting day-to-day spending. Mason notes that this approach requires patience from an electorate that is increasingly restless and has been feeling financially squeezed for years. The government hopes that long-term investments will ultimately deliver tangible benefits, but it faces the challenge of maintaining public support during a period of austerity.</p>

The study found that children's deaths by homicide and suicide also increased in states with the most permissive firearm laws.
