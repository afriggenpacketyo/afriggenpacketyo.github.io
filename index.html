        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio disputes the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not controlled by NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Rubio argues that the gang is indeed exported by the Venezuelan regime and cites an FBI assessment supporting his claim. He points to evidence suggesting the gang was contracted to murder an opposition member in Chile. The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members, a move that has faced legal challenges, and Rubio's stance underscores the administration's hardline approach to immigration and national security.</p>

Meleana Estes, a lei maker who learned from her grandmother, emphasizes the intention and love put into each lei. However, the tradition faces challenges due to suburban sprawl and climate change, leading to increased flower imports. Andrew Mau, who owns a lei boutique, adapts by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis" in response to the dwindling flower supply.</p>
