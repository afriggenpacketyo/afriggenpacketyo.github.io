          <p>The D.C. National Guard's deployment in Washington has been extended until November 30 to ensure public safety, according to its commanding general. This decision comes as part of the Trump administration's federal crime crackdown in the capital. However, the extension has prompted a lawsuit from the D.C. Attorney General, who argues that the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement is an overreach of federal power. The White House maintains its commitment to the long-term security of the city for residents and visitors.</p>

          <p>As a strike by 3,200 unionized defense workers enters its second month, Boeing has announced plans to hire permanent replacement employees for manufacturing roles. The company stated the move is necessary to maintain support for its customers, including for F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union has criticized the decision, urging Boeing to return to negotiations over a new contract. The dispute centers on wages and benefits, with the union rejecting a previous offer despite it including significant pay increases.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is advancing a ban on selling high-caffeine energy drinks to children, citing concerns over health impacts like poor sleep, anxiety, and obesity. This move follows similar restrictions in other European nations and comes amid studies linking youth consumption to adverse health effects. While the U.S. lacks federal regulation, states like Connecticut have enacted their own bans, and several others are considering similar legislation. Health experts in the U.S. warn about the risks of high caffeine and sugar intake for children, emphasizing the potential for a dangerous cycle of stimulant dependency.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock dropped significantly after the company released a full-year earnings forecast that fell far short of Wall Street expectations. While second-quarter results were mixed, the company cited the financial impact of tariffs as a primary reason for lowering its profit guidance. CEO Calvin McDonald also admitted that some of the company's product lines, particularly in its lounge and social categories, have become "stale" and are not resonating with customers. The revised outlook has heightened investor concerns about the athletic apparel maker's ability to navigate economic pressures and maintain its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle to the Supreme Court, seeking permission to fire Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. Lower courts previously ruled her termination was illegal and ordered her reinstatement, arguing that FTC commissioners can only be removed for cause, such as neglect or malfeasance. President Trump, who did not provide a reason for the firing, is asking the high court to pause her reinstatement while he appeals the case. This legal challenge is part of a broader effort by the administration to assert greater control over independent federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Broadcom reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a 63% jump in its AI-related revenue to $5.2 billion. The company, which develops custom chips and networking parts for major cloud companies, also provided a strong revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter. CEO Hock Tan attributed the growth to the high demand for custom AI accelerators and VMware software. This performance reflects investors' optimism that Broadcom could challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, as its stock has nearly doubled in the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For families with undocumented parents and U.S.-citizen children, the new school year is overshadowed by fears of immigration enforcement. Many parents report limiting their families' activities and movements due to anxiety about potential encounters with ICE agents, particularly near schools, which are no longer considered off-limits for enforcement. This fear has led to increased student absenteeism in some districts and has prompted educators to consider contingency plans like online classes. The article highlights the daily stress and difficult conversations these families face, balancing the need for education with the risk of separation.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was intensely questioned by senators from both parties during a heated hearing regarding his agency's policies. Republicans, invoking the legacy of President Trump's Operation Warp Speed, criticized Kennedy's decisions to limit access to COVID vaccines and cancel mRNA research funding. Democrats, meanwhile, challenged him on his broader approach to immunizations and the recent ousting of the CDC director, with several calling for his resignation. Kennedy defended his actions, arguing they were necessary to restore scientific integrity to the agencies.</p>

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, doubling its valuation to approximately $10 billion. The successful capital raise, which included investment from Nvidia, is seen as a crucial step toward a planned initial public offering in 2027. An IPO would allow Honeywell to unlock significant value from its long-term investment in the nascent technology. While quantum computing is not yet a major source of revenue, its potential to solve complex problems has attracted substantial interest from investors and major tech companies.

          <p>Las Vegas has launched a new marketing campaign to combat a seven-month decline in visitor numbers, with July showing a 12% year-over-year drop. Industry leaders suggest that perceptions of poor value and affordability have contributed to the slump, and that the city needs to better promote its budget-friendly options. The downturn in Las Vegas is raising concerns that it could be a leading indicator of a broader slowdown in the U.S. travel industry. Factors such as a sharp drop in Canadian visitors and increased U.S. visa costs are also cited as significant obstacles for the sector.</p>

The shooter, Robin Westman, spent about 40 minutes in the store the weekend before killing two children and injuring 21 others at the Church of the Annunciation. While Westman passed all required background checks, the revolver purchased was not used in the attack; an assault-style rifle and other firearms were recovered at the scene.

          <p>The upcoming August jobs report is anticipated to show continued weakness in the U.S. labor market, with economists forecasting the addition of just 75,000 jobs. Investors are looking for a "sweet spot" number—cool enough to support a Federal Reserve interest rate cut but not so weak as to heighten recession fears. The report will also face increased scrutiny following President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month, which has raised concerns about the integrity of federal economic data. Recent weaker-than-expected data has set a cautious tone for the official release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of its tariff policy, but its legal petition contains arguments that could undermine its own case. The administration describes the tariffs as a "most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative" with a multi-trillion-dollar impact. According to some legal scholars, this description fits the criteria of the "major questions doctrine," a principle recently used by the court's conservative majority to strike down major Biden administration policies that lacked explicit and clear congressional authorization. This sets up a test of whether the court will apply the same standard to a Republican president.</p>

          <p>The federal government has filed two lawsuits against Southern California Edison, alleging the utility's poorly maintained equipment sparked two major wildfires, including the deadly Eaton Fire. The Eaton Fire, which ignited in January, destroyed over 9,400 structures and resulted in 17 fatalities. The lawsuits seek more than $77 million in damages to cover firefighting costs and other losses, claiming a "troubling pattern of negligence" by the utility. Edison has acknowledged that circumstantial evidence suggests its equipment may have been associated with the fire's ignition but has not made a conclusive determination.</p>
