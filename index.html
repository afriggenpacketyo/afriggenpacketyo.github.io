        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in Thailand have arrested a woman accused of seducing numerous Buddhist monks, including senior abbots, into sexual relationships and then extorting them for millions of dollars. The scandal has prompted at least nine monks to be disrobed and has shed light on the vast, often opaque finances of religious temples. In response to the high-profile case, which involved funds being spent on online gambling, Thai authorities are now considering new laws to increase the financial transparency of temples and restore public faith in Buddhism.</p>

          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, with earnings per share surpassing analyst expectations while overall revenue fell slightly short. The company's net interest income, a key metric for profitability, missed estimates due to lower interest rates compared to the previous year, despite growth in loans and deposits. CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted the resilience of consumers and positive momentum in the bank's market businesses, noting it was the fourth straight quarter of rising net interest income.

          <p>The UK's defence secretary, John Healey, stated he was "unable to say for sure" if anyone was killed following a major data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had supported British forces. The leak occurred in February 2022 but was kept secret by a super-injunction until recently, sparking constitutional concerns. A resettlement scheme has brought 4,500 affected Afghans to the UK at a projected cost of £850 million, though hundreds are believed to remain in Afghanistan, prompting apologies and calls for greater government accountability.</p>

          <p>Haitian police seized over 2,300 pounds of cocaine and killed three suspected drug traffickers in a shootout on a boat near Tortue Island. During the raid, suspects opened fire on officers, leading to a fatal exchange; a fourth suspect from the Bahamas was arrested. This rare, large-scale drug bust highlights Haiti's role as a transit hub for narcotics destined for the U.S. The incident also underscores previous U.S. government assertions that powerful political and business elites in Haiti are deeply involved in the country's drug trade.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a debate on a funding-cut package requested by President Trump, which targets National Public Radio (NPR), PBS, and international aid programs. The measure, which required a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance to proceed, aims to rescind billions in funding, citing alleged political bias in public broadcasting. Meanwhile, a recent Labor Department report showed a slight increase in annual inflation, a trend some analysts attribute to the administration's tariffs, complicating the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, enabling carriers to resume flights after significant improvements in aviation safety standards. The prohibition was enacted in 2020 following a scandal where it was revealed that nearly one-third of Pakistan's pilots held fraudulent licenses, a discovery made after a fatal crash.

          <p>President Trump's fundraising for his future presidential library is drawing criticism due to the lack of transparency and regulation governing such donations. Concerns have been amplified by large contributions, including a Boeing 747 from Qatar and multimillion-dollar legal settlements, raising questions about potential influence peddling. In response, Senate Democrats are introducing legislation to cap donations at $10,000 during a president's term, require quarterly disclosures, and implement a post-presidency "cooling off" period for foreign and other sensitive donations, addressing a loophole that has been a concern across multiple administrations.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military conducted a strike near the Syrian Ministry of Defense in Damascus as intense clashes resumed in the southern city of Sweida between government forces and local Druze armed groups. A ceasefire collapsed after Syria's Defense Ministry accused militias of violating the agreement, leading to renewed military operations in the Druze-majority province. Israel has increased its military presence and strikes in the region, stating it is acting to protect the Druze minority and will escalate its response if Syrian forces do not withdraw from the area.</p>

          <p>At least 20 Palestinians were killed in a deadly crowd crush at an aid distribution site in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-backed organization that runs the site, claimed the surge was deliberately instigated by armed individuals affiliated with Hamas, who have not commented. Palestinian health officials reported the deaths were due to suffocation, and the UN has noted hundreds of killings near aid sites in recent weeks. The tragedy highlights the desperation and chaos surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn enclave.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending package introduces sweeping changes to the federal student loan system, including new lifetime borrowing limits for students and parents. Effective July 2026, the legislation establishes a total lifetime cap of $257,500 and sets specific annual and lifetime limits for graduate, professional, and parent PLUS loans, while eliminating Grad PLUS loans entirely. Experts suggest these changes will significantly alter how higher education is financed, potentially forcing students to borrow less, rely more on private loans, or reconsider expensive graduate programs.

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion piece argues that recent operations by federal agents in Los Angeles, such as a raid on MacArthur Park, serve as a warning from the Trump administration to Democratic states.

Richard Pryor saw the armed man begin firing in the church parking lot and, realizing there was no time to wait for police, drove his truck directly into the shooter. This action temporarily stopped the assailant, allowing the church's armed security team to intervene and fatally shoot the suspect. Pryor's quick thinking is credited with saving the lives of over 100 congregants, including children, who were inside.</p>

According to the data, 68% of the 2,031 people arrested by ICE in a seven-county area had no criminal record. This information supports the argument that the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement operations are not prioritizing the removal of dangerous individuals but are instead focused on mass detentions.

A study of individuals with "exceptional" cognitive performance for their age found that genetics played a role, but so did behaviors such as getting high-quality sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health. Experts recommend consistent sleep schedules, physical and social activity, and controlling vascular risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol, as these measures can help preserve brain structure and function later in life.</p>
