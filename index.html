            <p>Mikal Mahdi, 42, was executed by firing squad in South Carolina after being convicted of two separate murders in 2004, including the killing of an off-duty police officer. Mahdi chose the firing squad over lethal injection and the electric chair. The execution marked the second time in five weeks that South Carolina has used a firing squad for an execution, and the fifth execution overall in the state in the past eight months. His lawyers argued that Mahdi was not fairly represented by his original lawyers. Optimism score: 5</p>

            <p>Market volatility, driven by President Trump's tariffs and fluctuating oil prices, is creating uncertainty for Alaska lawmakers as they craft the state budget. The instability has exacerbated tensions over the allocation of funds between the annual oil-wealth fund check for residents and essential services like education. Lawmakers are struggling to balance spending with volatile revenue forecasts tied to oil prices, with some hoping that Trump's tariffs might spur investment in Alaska's liquefied natural gas project. The situation highlights the challenges of budgeting in a state heavily reliant on oil revenue. Optimism score: 55</p>

            <p>Millions of Beijing residents were advised to stay indoors as the city experienced its strongest winds in decades, leading to the suspension of flights and public transport.

            <p>Residents in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, are worried about the increasing threat of wildfires due to climate change, after a recent blaze came close to their homes. Fire crews managed to prevent the flames from reaching their properties, but the incident has heightened fears about the future. Experts predict milder winters and spring droughts will exacerbate the risk of wildfires in the coming years, making it harder for firefighters to respond to other emergencies. The community is particularly concerned about the impact of fires on wildlife and the potential for larger, more frequent incidents. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>A once-acclaimed Swedish eco-retreat, Stedsans, has been embroiled in scandal after investigations revealed the owners fled to Guatemala amid tax evasion allegations, leaving behind environmental damage and unpaid debts.
