        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have introduced a bill proposing $880 billion in cuts, primarily to Medicaid, to offset the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks championed by President Trump. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, potentially impacting millions of Americans' healthcare coverage. Democrats are criticizing the cuts as a repeal of Obamacare, warning of hospital closures and increased premiums. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million people could lose healthcare coverage due to these proposals, which also include rolling back Biden-era green energy programs.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane. The White House stated that legal details are being worked out and any donation would comply with the law. The Qatari government clarified that the transfer is under review for temporary use and not a gift, disputing reports that the plane will be gifted during this trip. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has urged an investigation into the ethics of accepting such a gift, citing its estimated $400 million value. Mr. Trump defended the potential gift as a transparent transaction to replace an aging Air Force One.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached an agreement to temporarily ease tariffs, reducing them by 115 percentage points for 90 days, in an effort to de-escalate trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will be reduced to about 30%, while China will lower its levies on American imports to 10%. The news has significantly buoyed commodities and currency markets, with stock futures soaring, indicating a positive market response to the breakthrough in trade negotiations.

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a 4% jump following the agreement between the U.S. and China to slash tariffs, which eased trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. U.S. crude oil rose to $63.54 per barrel, while Brent crude increased to $66.24 per barrel. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that further meetings are expected in the coming weeks to work towards a more comprehensive agreement. The reduced tariff rates, in place for 90 days, are intended to stimulate economic growth and boost demand for oil, providing relief to U.S. shale oil producers who require higher crude prices to maintain profitable drilling operations.</p>

          <p>Celebrity musicians, including Elton John and Dua Lipa, are protesting the UK government's proposed copyright law reforms that would allow AI developers to use copyrighted content for training their models. The artists have signed an open letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support an amendment requiring AI labs to disclose which copyrighted works they use. The current proposals would place the onus on artists to opt out of having their work scraped for AI training, a move that the creative industries argue undervalues their work.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a legislative plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients and roll back Biden's electric vehicle (EV) mandate as part of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." The legislation mandates 80 hours per week of work for able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid and restricts federal funding for states covering illegal immigrants. The bill also aims to end the EV mandate, projecting $105 billion in savings, and expedite natural gas permitting. A provision making certain abortion providers ineligible for Medicaid funding has sparked controversy among moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has announced its plans to reduce immigration to the UK through a series of measures designed to create a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key proposals include tightening work visa requirements, doubling the residency period for immigrants to apply for indefinite leave to remain, and scrapping the dedicated visa for social care providers. At the same time, the government says it wants to expand eligibility for the existing "high potential individual" visa. Stricter rules for overseas graduates and increased English language requirements are also part of the plan. While the government aims to significantly reduce net migration, it is not setting an overall cap.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal seeks to cut $163 billion from social services, including education, housing, and health programs that benefit lower-income Americans. The cuts largely avoid major programs like Social Security and Medicare, focusing instead on discretionary spending. The budget proposes significant changes to how aid is distributed, such as converting rental assistance into block grants, potentially reducing direct benefits to renters. Critics argue that these changes mirror past welfare reforms that diverted funds away from basic assistance. This budget is a blueprint for how the administration will hurt low-income families.</p>
