          <p>A leisure centre in Larne, Northern Ireland, was attacked during a third night of violence, following unrest that began with a protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena. Masked individuals threw objects at the leisure centre, which was being used to shelter families displaced by the disturbances. Police responded in riot gear, and the fire service attended to extinguish a fire that caused extensive smoke damage. Local politicians condemned the violence, describing it as "absolute disorder" and expressing concern for the safety of residents. Additional police officers have been deployed to the affected areas to address the ongoing unrest.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced that at least five criminal cases have been filed related to the ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles. Charges include assault on a peace officer, resisting arrest, burglary, and vandalism.

Several individuals have been charged with felonies and face potential state prison sentences. The DA noted that peaceful protests have largely outweighed instances of violence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The ruling prevents the government from deporting Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge stated that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled. However, the administration can still attempt to deport Khalil for allegedly omitting details on his green card application. The Trump administration has been attempting to deport several international students involved in pro-Palestinian campus activism.</p>

Newsom's strong opposition to Trump presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the governor, whose term ends next year and who has presidential ambitions. Trump has criticized Newsom's leadership and threatened to cut off federal aid to California. Newsom has responded by condemning Trump's deployment of military personnel and accusing him of authoritarianism.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that social media companies can be held accountable for certain types of content published by users on their platforms. This decision could lead to fines for companies that fail to remove illegal content after a court order. While a majority of judges supported the ruling, they did not agree on the specific types of content that would be considered illegal. The current law only holds social media companies responsible for third-party content if they fail to remove it after a court order.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the Trump administration is open to extending the 90-day tariff pause beyond July 9 for trading partners showing "good faith" in ongoing trade negotiations.

This suggests a potential shift in the administration's stance, as officials previously emphasized the need for an agreement before extending the pause.
