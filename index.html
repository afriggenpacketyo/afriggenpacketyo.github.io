          <p>A 10-year-old boy named Oliver Price has been identified as the victim of a fatal coach crash in Somerset, England. The bus, carrying middle school students, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope near Wheddon Cross. Five other people, including two children, remain hospitalized but are reported to be in stable condition. Avon and Somerset Police have launched a major investigation into the cause of the incident, which is expected to take a significant amount of time, while offering support to the affected school and community.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly advising Apple to make a significant acquisition in the artificial intelligence sector, specifically suggesting the AI-powered search engine Perplexity. The move is seen as necessary for Apple to transition from a passive "toll taker" to a proactive AI leader, especially as its current business model faces legal challenges like the DOJ's antitrust case against Google, which threatens a lucrative search agreement. Melius analyst Ben Reitzes proposed that acquiring Perplexity and launching a subscription service could cause Apple's stock to surge, a sentiment echoed by CNBC's Jim Cramer.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded the Washington Commanders football team change its name back to the "Redskins," threatening to obstruct any deal for a new stadium in Washington, D.C., if they refuse. In social media posts, Trump called the "Commanders" moniker ridiculous and claimed the team's heritage is being taken away. The team dropped its former name in 2020 following years of criticism over its racist connotations, a sentiment supported by studies showing it offended many Native Americans. Team leadership has previously stated they have no plans to change the current name.</p>

Bessent argued that with inflation moderating, the Fed should consider easing its monetary policy.

          <p>An artist named Maria Farmer, one of the first women to accuse Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual assault, reportedly told law enforcement in 1996 and 2006 to investigate powerful men in their circle, including Donald Trump. Farmer recounted an unsettling late-night encounter with Trump at Epstein's office in 1995, which she said she reported to the FBI at the time. Law enforcement has never accused Trump of wrongdoing related to Epstein. The account surfaces amid renewed scrutiny over Trump's past association with Epstein and delays in the release of federal investigative files.</p>

          <p>Travis Eugene Posey has pleaded guilty to four counts of capital murder and eleven counts of attempted capital murder for a 2024 mass shooting at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce, Arkansas. The attack killed four people and injured eleven others, including two police officers. Posey, who was injured by police during an exchange of fire, opened fire indiscriminately on people in the parking lot and inside the store. Having previously pleaded not guilty, his change of plea avoids a trial, and he is scheduled for sentencing on August 4.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has expanded its ground operations into Deir al-Balah, an area in central Gaza that had been relatively untouched during the war. This region, which includes several large, historic refugee camps, is considered a major remaining stronghold for Hamas leadership and operations. The IDF had previously avoided a large-scale offensive in the area, possibly due to concerns about hostages being held there. The new operation, which began with evacuation orders and airstrikes, is seen as a strategic move to pressure Hamas as ceasefire negotiations have stalled, targeting the group's last significant redoubt.</p>

Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, was a computer enthusiast who created websites to document Eucharistic miracles, earning him the nickname "patron saint of the internet." The relic was brought from Italy by an archbishop for a special mass at St. Hedwig Church.

          <p>Filing for a tax extension with the IRS provides an additional six months to submit your tax return, but it does not delay the deadline for payment. Taxpayers must still estimate their tax liability and pay what they owe by the original April 15 deadline to avoid penalties and interest. The late payment penalty is typically 0.5% of the unpaid amount per month, while interest accrues daily on the outstanding balance. For those unable to pay their full tax bill, the IRS offers options such as installment agreements or, in cases of severe financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

The international diving project, ProjectXplore, identified the wreck at a depth of 82 meters, confirming its identity through its dimensions and an embossed name stamp on the stern.
