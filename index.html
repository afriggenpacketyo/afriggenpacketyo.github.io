          <p>A recent interview between a journalist and an AI-powered avatar of Joaquin Oliver, a victim of the Parkland school shooting, has ignited a debate over the ethical use of technology. The AI, created at the request of Oliver's grieving parents to support their gun control campaign, uses his old social media posts to replicate his voice and persona. This article explores the profound moral questions surrounding digital resurrection, the potential for exploiting grief, and the blurring lines between human identity and artificial recreation in a post-truth world. The piece warns of the complex challenges this technology poses for journalism, law, and society's understanding of mortality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has announced it will deny early retirement options for transgender service members with 15 to 18 years of service, instead separating them without retirement benefits. This policy, stemming from Trump administration rules, reverses a previous notification that had allowed about a dozen members to believe they could retire. Affected personnel, like Master Sergeant Logan Ireland who has served for 15 years, expressed feelings of betrayal and devastation. Legal experts anticipate lawsuits, calling the decision arbitrary and cruel, as it forces experienced service members to choose between a lump-sum payout or involuntary separation.</p>

A board member from Allianz highlighted that the world is approaching temperature thresholds where covering financial services like mortgages against extreme weather events will no longer be feasible. Insurers point to a growing "protection gap," where two-thirds of economic losses from natural catastrophes are already uninsured, placing immense strain on individuals and governments. The industry fears that continued warming will make adaptation impossible and threaten the fundamental stability of the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the UK government's reluctance to confirm it, economic think tanks like NIESR are forecasting that tax hikes will be necessary this autumn. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces a "trilemma" where she cannot simultaneously meet her self-imposed fiscal rules, fulfill spending commitments, and honor the promise of not raising taxes on working people. To close a projected budget deficit of over £40 billion by 2029-30, the government's only remaining lever appears to be a sustained increase in taxation. Options like raising VAT or income tax are being considered, though each presents significant political and economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have uncovered evidence of a grisly cannibalistic feast that occurred in a single incident approximately 5,700 years ago in the El Mirador cave in Spain. The remains of at least 11 individuals, including children, show clear signs of being skinned, cooked, and eaten by other humans. Analysis of the bones suggests this was not a ritual or a response to famine, but rather a violent episode, possibly resulting from inter-clan conflict between neighboring communities. This discovery provides a nuanced look into the role of cannibalism as a tool of social control and violence in prehistoric Europe.</p>

Haney became a media personality for her mob justice tactics but was later exposed as the matriarch of a notorious crime family and a major heroin dealer.

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton captured the biggest title of his career, winning his first ATP Masters 1000 tournament at the Canadian Open in Toronto. The 22-year-old fourth seed rallied after losing the first set to defeat Karen Khachanov of Russia in a thrilling three-set final, 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). Shelton's impressive run to the championship included victories over several highly-seeded players. With this win, he becomes the youngest American man to claim a Masters 1000 title since Andy Roddick achieved the feat in 2004.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, covering all children born in the U.S. who would be affected by the order. The ruling stated that the plaintiffs were "extremely likely" to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated that the University of California should not bend "on their knees" in negotiations with the Trump administration to restore over half a billion dollars in frozen federal grants. The funding for UCLA was suspended amid accusations of antisemitism on campus, and Newsom cautioned against settlements like those struck by Ivy League universities, which included large fines and concessions on academic freedom. He expressed confidence that the UC system would "do the right thing" and uphold its principles against political pressure. This marks the governor's first major public comment on how the university should handle the dispute.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for Vice President JD Vance has stated that the senator and his staff had no knowledge of a Secret Service request to raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River for a family boating trip. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers confirmed it raised the outflow of a lake to support the "safe navigation" of Vance's security detail after a public safety boat allegedly ran aground during a scouting mission. The Secret Service emphasized the decision was made independently during standard planning and did not involve the Vice President's office, though the incident has drawn public scrutiny.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Science Advances quantifies how climate change has significantly altered California's fire season, causing it to start earlier and last longer across the state. Researchers found that, on average, the fire season now begins about six weeks sooner than it did in the early 1990s, with some northern regions seeing it start 46 days earlier. The primary drivers are not human-ignited fires, which have decreased, but rather earlier snowmelt and increased drying of vegetation due to rising temperatures. This research provides definitive data linking anthropogenic climate change to the year-round threat of wildfires that many Californians now face.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new bounty, accusing Maduro of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and collaborating with cartels. This move escalates U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan leader, who was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020. The Venezuelan government condemned the announcement as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction, highlighting the ongoing deep-seated tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A recent war game simulation held in Singapore explored the response of Southeast Asian nations to a hypothetical Chinese military blockade of Taiwan. The exercise, involving officials and security scholars, revealed the immense challenge of evacuating nearly one million of their nationals from the island. According to participants, a stark conclusion emerged: a successful large-scale evacuation would be nearly impossible without a Singaporean-led airlift. This highlights Singapore's unique and discreet long-standing security presence in Taiwan, which could provide critical access to airfields and resources in a real-world crisis, underscoring the region's complex contingency planning.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent announcement of new tariffs on semiconductors and chips is raising questions about its potential geopolitical impact in Southeast Asia. The duties, which exempt companies "building in the United States," could create an opening for China to strengthen its position in the region, according to some analysts. With Southeast Asian economies already navigating other U.S. tariffs, the policy unpredictability from Washington may push them to seek more stable economic partnerships. The move could inadvertently tilt the regional balance by making China a more attractive alternative for trade and investment in the critical tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump has walked back a previous claim that he would only meet with Putin if Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was also present, stating it is now "up to him." Meanwhile, Putin expressed a desire to meet but noted that the conditions for a trilateral summit with Zelenskyy are not yet in place.

A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, whose species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe in recent decades. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, the species' expansion has been faster than models predicted. It is not yet known if the butterfly will establish a breeding population in the UK, as its primary food source is not widely planted there.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official population count used for congressional apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial census to enumerate all persons, which has historically been interpreted to include everyone regardless of citizenship status. This move reignites a legal battle from Trump's first term, when his administration's attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. Changing the census is a lengthy process, and this directive sets the stage for significant legal and political challenges.</p>
