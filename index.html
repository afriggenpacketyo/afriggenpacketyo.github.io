        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is considering a bill to allow homeless community college and state university students to sleep in their cars on campus parking lots, addressing the severe housing crisis affecting students. The bill aims to provide immediate relief, turning campus lots into safe havens while the state works on lasting solutions to the housing shortage. Critics argue this is a desperate measure reflecting the failure of Democratic policies, while supporters emphasize it's a necessary short-term solution amid increasing student homelessness. The bill has garnered national attention, sparking debate about California's housing market and the broader issue of student homelessness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis casts doubt on recent claims of detecting life-associated gases in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, suggesting the data might be too noisy to draw definitive conclusions. The reanalysis, using a simple method to look for gas molecules, found the data consistent with a flat line, indicating no clear signal. Experts emphasize the need for more observations and robust, model-independent detections before claiming biosignatures. This highlights the complexities of interpreting data from the James Webb Space Telescope and the importance of responsible science communication in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the potential role of gut bacteria, specifically a toxin called colibactin produced by certain strains of E. coli, in the increasing rates of colon cancer among young adults. Research suggests that early childhood exposure to colibactin may cause DNA damage, increasing the risk of developing colorectal cancer later in life. While not the sole cause, colibactin is believed to be one of many factors, including diet and lifestyle, contributing to the rise in cases. The research opens new avenues for understanding and potentially preventing early-onset colon cancer.</p>

A Chinese research team concluded that frequent Philippine construction and fishery activities contributed to the coral reef ecosystem's 'serious degradation.' The investigation also noted that the ecology at nearby Whitsun Reef was generally healthy.</p>
