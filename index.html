        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a sharp 34.5% decline in shipments to the U.S., marking the steepest drop since February 2020. Imports from the U.S. also decreased by over 18%, leading to a reduction in China's trade surplus with the U.S. to $18 billion. Overall exports rose by 4.8%, while imports plunged by 3.4%, attributed to sluggish domestic demand. This was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Reich argues that the Trump administration is establishing a police state through actions like deploying federal agents and the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. He outlines a five-step process involving declaring an emergency, using federal agents against civilians, allowing warrantless arrests, creating detention camps, and potentially declaring martial law. Reich emphasizes the importance of peaceful protests and resistance to combat what he sees as an emerging authoritarian infrastructure. He notes that history shows that once such infrastructure is in place, it can be turned against anyone.</p>

          <p>India's ambitious $80 billion coal-power expansion is running into water scarcity issues, particularly in already stressed regions. Many new power plants are planned for India's driest areas, potentially leading to conflicts between industry and residents over limited water resources. The location of coal-fired power plants is often determined by access to land, even if water is scarce. The Solapur plant is an example of this, where the plant competes with residents for water, highlighting the challenges facing India's energy and water management.</p>

Although prospects for June seem better, the manufacturing and trade sectors in China are still under strain. This is due to uncertainties from American tariffs, and these issues are the result of the ongoing trade war between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>
