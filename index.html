          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated she declined an offer from US President Donald Trump to send American troops to Mexico to combat drug cartels, asserting Mexico's sovereignty. Sheinbaum emphasized the possibility of collaboration and information sharing but firmly rejected the presence of the US Army on Mexican soil. She also urged Trump to address weapons smuggling from the US, which contributes to cartel violence in Mexico, where over 450,000 people have died since the war on drug gangs began.

          <p>Residents in Boca Chica Village, Texas, are voting on incorporating the area as a new municipality named Starbase, driven by Elon Musk's SpaceX presence. The proposed city would establish a local government with control over planning and taxation.

The incorporation vote and the state bill could lead to conflicts between Starbase and county officials over access to Boca Chica Beach.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a law allocating $1 billion for school vouchers, making over 5 million students eligible to use state funds for private schools. This law is a significant victory for conservatives aiming to reshape public education, arguing it empowers parents to choose the best school for their child. Opponents contend that vouchers drain money from public schools and primarily benefit wealthier families, as voucher payments rarely cover the full cost of private schools. The law allows most Texas students to receive up to $10,000 a year to attend private schools starting in the 2026-27 school year.</p>

          <p>Leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell has apologized for describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a heated debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions. The remark prompted backlash from political opponents, with Powell clarifying that she regards child exploitation and grooming with the "utmost seriousness." During the program, Powell challenged claims made by a Reform UK member regarding diversity roles within councils, leading to the exchange about a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs. Powell stated she was challenging the political point scoring around the issue, not the issue itself.</p>

          <p>A large homeless encampment in the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon has been cleared by federal officials, forcing dozens of people to relocate.

Advocates estimate that 100 to 200 people had been living in the encampment, highlighting the growing chasm between rich and poor in the area. The removal was described as the largest eviction of a homeless camp in recent history, underscoring the lack of solutions to the homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a plea deal offered to a sheriff's deputy convicted of using excessive force.
