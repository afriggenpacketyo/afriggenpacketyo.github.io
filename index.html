          <p>Prince Harry's recent public plea for reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, has brought renewed attention to the ongoing rifts within the British royal family. This comes at a time when King Charles is managing his cancer treatments and continuing his royal duties, including international travel and hosting state events. Some royal watchers fear that the unresolved family drama could overshadow Charles' reign and undermine the monarchy's image of unity. Prince William has taken on a more prominent public role amid his father's illness and his brother's estrangement, including representing the King at international events and focusing on initiatives like tackling homelessness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has united Iranians across political and ideological divides in opposition. The Persian Gulf has been known by that name since at least 550 B.C., and Iranians view it as a core part of their national identity. Experts suggest that this move could negatively impact ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S. due to increased mistrust. Even Iranian opposition figures have condemned the idea, viewing it as an insult to Iranian history and civilization.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become a political influencer due to his fervent support for President Trump. His advocacy has made him unpopular at home, where he was even assaulted, but has also opened doors to investors and media attention. Boassen envisions a close security alliance between an independent Greenland and the United States, aiming to break away from Denmark's perceived failures in defending the territory. He now works for an organization promoting U.S.-Greenland ties, believing Greenland's future is brightest with America, despite opposition from many Greenlanders who don't want to become part of the United States.</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, both countries have accused each other of violating the terms just hours after it was reached. India claims Pakistan breached the agreement with a border intrusion, while Pakistan blames Indian forces for initiating the violation. The ceasefire followed weeks of clashes triggered by a massacre on tourists, escalating tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. The United States, along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, played a role in facilitating the agreement, but the ongoing accusations raise concerns about its sustainability.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to execute autonomous aerobatic maneuvers. The algorithm allows drones to potentially outperform human pilots in complex flight missions. Aerobatic flight involves high-risk maneuvers typically avoided in conventional aviation, but this technology unlocks new possibilities for drone applications. The breakthrough draws inspiration from the aerial acrobatics observed in nature, where birds and bats use such maneuvers for hunting and obstacle avoidance.</p>

Trump expressed a desire to see China open up to American business for the benefit of both countries.

The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib effectively targets the HER2 protein, blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which drives cell growth.

          <p>The Tokyo government has begun redeveloping a two-kilometer expressway in the Ginza district into an elevated green walkway, scheduled for completion in the 2040s. The "Tokyo Sky Corridor" will replace the "KK Line," aiming to create a tourist attraction modeled after New York City's High Line. The project will include soil, trees, flowers, benches, public restrooms, rest areas, and cafes, but faces challenges such as summer heat and structural weight. The project is expected to cost 14 billion yen ($97 million), with the goal of attracting global attention to the area.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers' previously perfect record against former Cy Young Award winners ended with a loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, as Corbin Burnes pitched seven shutout innings. Despite a strong performance from Dodgers starter Dustin May, the Diamondbacks secured a 3-0 victory. The loss also continued a troubling trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records, going 3-8 in those contests. While the Dodgers had impressive wins against Cy Young winners earlier in the season, Burnes proved to be a formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intervened to de-escalate a conflict between India and Pakistan, fearing it could escalate to a nuclear exchange. Initially, Vice President JD Vance suggested it was "none of our business," but the administration grew concerned after strikes hit near Pakistan's nuclear command. The U.S. contacted leaders in both countries, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio urging General Munir of Pakistan to find a way out of the crisis. While Pakistan acknowledged U.S. mediation, India did not, highlighting the complex dynamics of the situation. The intervention underscores the delicate balance and potential for miscalculation in the region.</p>

          <p>China's car sales increased for the third consecutive month in April, driven by government-subsidized trade-ins that offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Passenger vehicle sales totaled 1.78 million units, with new energy vehicles (electric and plug-in hybrids) accounting for over half of the total. While car exports declined, domestic consumer confidence was bolstered by the government's trade-in scheme, which favored NEVs. However, automated-driving systems are becoming less of a sales catalyst due to government scrutiny following a fatal crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 sedan.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming more viable suppliers, supported by overseas investment and cooperative farming initiatives. Yunnan, the southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a key role in regional agricultural cooperation. The province's involvement dates back decades to the "alternative crop cultivation programme", which aimed to reduce opium production in the region by sharing agricultural technology and promoting sustainable economic alternatives. Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could serve as an effective way to support the countryâ€™s food security by diversifying its food supply sources.</p>
