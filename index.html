          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported a strong first-quarter operating profit, exceeding analyst expectations, but cautioned that U.S.-China trade tariffs could negatively impact global container market volumes. The company revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast from 4% to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc attributed the strong first-quarter results to robust demand and a strong economy from the previous year. The shipping industry is currently navigating a complex tariff landscape initiated by the U.S., with retaliatory measures from China adding to the uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Boston issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing a violation of their due process rights. The order came after reports that the U.S. military was preparing to fly migrants to Libya, a country mired in conflict. Libya's prime minister stated that his country refuses to be a destination for migrant deportations. The judge's ruling stated that the deportations would defy a prior injunction protecting migrants' rights to written notice and an opportunity to file a claim against removal.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with Omdia expecting nearly as many sales in 2025 alone. The company also reported its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results, showing a decrease in revenue and profit due to anticipation for the new console. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concern that additional tariffs could impact demand in the U.S., potentially affecting profit. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, noted that Nintendo's forecasts are typically conservative, but tariffs create an unclear future for the company.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation. The agreement would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, later pausing them for negotiations. Details remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. Timothy C. Brightbill, an international trade attorney, suggests the announcement may be a framework for future negotiations covering tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and digital trade.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that home washing machines may not effectively remove harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, from healthcare uniforms. The research found that many machines failed to disinfect clothing, even at high temperatures, potentially leading to the spread of superbugs. The study suggests that domestic detergents could contribute to the creation of antibiotic-resistant strains. Experts recommend that healthcare professionals and institutions re-evaluate policies allowing workers to wash uniforms at home, advocating for standardized in-house laundering or industrial laundries.</p>

          <p>Economists warn that proposed cuts to scientific research could have dire consequences for GDP. Trump's budget proposes deep cuts to NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. These cuts could undermine America's economic growth, as fundamental science underpins private-sector productivity. While some argue the private sector could replace government funding, many economists believe industry cannot fully substitute for the government's role in basic research.</p>

The study, published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters, highlights that these chemicals are present in a wide range of beauty products, not just hair relaxers. Researchers are calling for government oversight and regulation of cosmetics, as the European Union banned formaldehyde as a cosmetic ingredient in 2009.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson has denied allegations of sexual assault made by several former employees. Four female housekeepers accused the singer-songwriter of sexual battery including sexual assault, false imprisonment, and labor violations. Robinson's lawyer called the allegations "vile" and "false," stating that the evidence will show this is an attempt to extract money from the 85-year-old icon. Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker and one of its most prominent recording artists.</p>

The UK has been desperate for a deal of this sort with the US since President Donald Trump unleashed his wave of global tariffs.</p>

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar claimed Pakistan deployed Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets in a clash with India's air force. AVIC, which manufactures the J-10C fighter jets, saw its Hong Kong-listed shares rising over 6%.</p>

Indian officials have suggested that they will make a new case there: that the Fund should refuse the extension of a $7 billion loan to Pakistan described as crucial to getting the country on more solid footing financially and to fund desperately needed services for its people. On April 23, India pulled out of a river-sharing treaty that has safeguarded Pakistan’s vulnerable water supply since 1960.</p>

A year ago, Toyota Motor reported the highest annual profit ever recorded by a Japanese firm.

It cited headwinds from a stronger yen and predicted a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump’s tariffs in April and May alone.</p>

Agatha Christie is dead. But Agatha Christie also just started teaching a writing class. The literary legend, who died in 1976, has been tapped to teach a course with BBC Maestro, an online lecture series similar to MasterClass. She has been reanimated with the help of a team of academic researchers — who wrote a script using her writings and archival interviews — and a “digital prosthetic” made with artificial intelligence and then fitted over a real actor’s performance.</p>

          <p>The deadly storms that tore through eight U.S. states in early April, killing at least 24 people, were made significantly worse by climate change, according to a study released this week. Analysis from World Weather Attribution, a climate science group, found that human-caused global warming made the record-breaking downpours about 9% heavier. The storm's intensity was fueled in part by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which were about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than normal due to climate change.</p>
