          <h2>Japan's Defense Ministry Urged to Establish UFO Investigation Office</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 06:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party group of lawmakers in Japan has requested the Defense Ministry to create an office dedicated to investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. The proposal, submitted to the defense chief, emphasizes the urgency of addressing UAP as a serious national security concern, pointing out that Japan has lagged behind other nations in this area. The lawmakers suggested that the new office should regularly report to parliament, disclose information to the public, conduct scientific analysis, and identify potential threats, modeling it after the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. Optimism that the Japanese government will take the UAP topic seriously is a good sign.</p>

          <p>China's military has cautioned that the US Space Force's plan to deploy "orbital carriers" could intensify the arms race in space. A PLA Daily commentary referenced a US$60 million contract awarded to Gravitics for developing an orbital transport craft capable of deploying multiple maneuverable space vehicles rapidly. The PLA suggests the craft could carry up to 10,000kg of payload, including over 150 kinetic kill vehicles, enabling offensive or defensive operations. The dual-use potential of such technology raises concerns about heightened vigilance among spacefaring nations, increasing the likelihood of military rivalry in space.</p>

          <p>HiSilicon, Huawei Technologies’ chip design unit, experienced a 100% revenue increase in 2024 due to Huawei's resurgence in the high-end smartphone market, according to Counterpoint Research. The unit's market share grew, capturing 12% of the global premium Android smartphone system-on-a-chip market, up from 8% in 2023, driven by the popularity of its Pura 70 and Mate 70 series smartphones. Other Chinese tech firms, like Xiaomi, are also seeking to design their own chips, with Xiaomi launching its smartphone chipset Xring O1 later this month. This indicates a growing trend of self-sufficiency in chip design among Chinese tech companies.</p>

          <p>A recent Vox article reports that Gen Z men are showing a slight revival in religious affiliation, particularly with Christianity, while young women are increasingly leaving religious congregations. This trend is contributing to a growing political polarization along gendered lines, with young men's politics drifting to the right as they find faith and belonging, while young women's political and social beliefs push them away from organized religions. The article suggests that this divergence could complicate electoral choices and impact the future of family life, dating, and social belonging, as religious and political beliefs of young men and women move further apart.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike after failing to reach an agreement on pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of train service and significant disruption for over 300,000 daily commuters. NJ Transit has implemented contingency plans, including supplemental chartered bus services from park-and-ride lots to Manhattan and PATH train stations, however, these buses can only accommodate about 20% of displaced train riders. Commuters are advised to work from home if possible, and alternative transportation options such as Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, and ferry services are available, with NJ Transit rail tickets being cross-honored on NJ Transit buses and light rail lines. This transit strike will impact commuters who rely on NJ Transit rail service.</p>

          <p>The Sunday Times Rich List 2025 reveals a decline in the number of UK billionaires, marking the sharpest drop in the list's 37-year history, attributed to factors like global tariffs and tax changes. Simultaneously, King Charles' personal wealth has increased by £30 million to £640 million, equaling the wealth of Rishi Sunak and his wife, primarily due to his inherited investment portfolio from Queen Elizabeth II. The Hinduja family tops the list for the fourth consecutive year, despite a decline in their fortune, with a recorded worth of more than £35 billion.</p>

          <p>India has blocked two Chinese state-backed social media accounts, those of Global Times and Xinhua, on X (formerly Twitter), accusing them of spreading "disinformation" during the recent conflict with Pakistan.

The debate includes amendments ensuring no obligation for medical staff to participate, preventing doctors from discussing assisted death with under 18s unless the patient initiates it, and requiring a government assessment of palliative care availability.

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the beginning of the war, though expectations for significant results are low. The meeting follows days of confusion and theatrics, with President Trump expressing support and offering to mediate. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Keith Kellogg attended initial talks with Ukrainian and Turkish officials, but President Putin did not attend. The Trump administration has cast doubt on the talks' prospects, suggesting that a breakthrough will only come through a meeting between Trump and Putin.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data in the UK indicates that the Labour Party has lost significant ground since its victory last summer, with Reform, a right-leaning party, leading in voting intention for the entirety of February.

The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, and analysts are assessing how many seats Reform could win in a future election.</p>
