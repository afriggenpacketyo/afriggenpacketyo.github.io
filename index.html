          <h2>Los Angeles Faces Backlash Against Trump's Immigration Enforcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 01:00:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's escalation of immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, including deploying the National Guard, has sparked significant backlash and protests. The administration's actions involved raids without judicial warrants, family separations, and confrontations with protesters using tear gas and flash bang grenades. Union leader David Huerta's arrest during the protests has further fueled anger, with critics like JD Vance suggesting the administration is targeting a Democratic city for political reasons. Despite the show of force, community leaders and politicians are urging resistance and condemning the administration's tactics, highlighting the community's resilience and determination not to back down amidst what they perceive as an attack on their neighbors and families. The current environment in Los Angeles is charged with tension as the community grapples with the implications of these enforcement actions. The activism and community outrage demonstrates that this is a moment of reckoning for many residents. The author reflects on the current state of the union. The author notes that the administration is trying to quell the protests and warned local leaders to brace for at least 30 days of ramped-up immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Two Russian human rights experts, Maria Kuznetsova and Dan Storyev, who fled Russia due to its slide into authoritarianism under President Vladimir Putin, have observed worrying markers of authoritarianism emerging in America. They argue that Americans lack the language to describe these phenomena, while Russians have developed a rich vocabulary to understand authoritarian realities. The experts provide a glossary of Russian terms, such as "mnogohodovochka" (master plan), to help Americans identify and understand these emerging trends. By naming and describing these trends, the experts hope to empower Americans to fight against authoritarianism and preserve their democratic values, drawing parallels between the tactics used in Russia and those seen in the current American political landscape. These experts provide a unique perspective on the current state of affairs. The authors reflect on the markers of authoritarianism and provide a glossary to help Americans understand the current state of affairs.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of 34.5% in May, marking the steepest drop since February 2020, while imports from the U.S. also fell by over 18%. This decline contributed to a 41.55% year-on-year shrinkage in China's trade surplus with the U.S., according to Wind Information. Overall exports rose 4.8%, missing expectations, and imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. Despite the U.S. decline, shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa increased, leading to a 25% rise in China's total trade surplus to $103.2 billion. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is expected to meet with U.S. trade negotiators in London to discuss resolving ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against immigration enforcement operations have intensified, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, including the National Guard. President Trump deployed the National Guard in response to what he described as "violence, clashes, and unrest," while California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory." The protests have involved demonstrators clashing with federal agents, vandalizing vehicles, and blocking freeways, resulting in numerous arrests and injuries. Local officials, including LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, have emphasized the department's limited role in immigration enforcement due to the California Values Act. The situation remains tense as federal authorities continue their operations, with ongoing protests and concerns over the escalation of force. The article details the chaos in downtown Los Angeles.

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, declining by 0.1% year-on-year, signaling persistent deflationary pressures. This trend is attributed to weak domestic demand and price wars in the automotive sector, despite government stimulus measures. Producer prices also deepened, falling 3.3% from a year earlier, marking the steepest decline since July 2023. Despite these concerns, core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.6%, the highest since January. Analysts are closely watching whether Beijing will implement further monetary easing to stimulate the economy, with potential policy announcements expected at the upcoming Lujiazui forum in Shanghai.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Pediatrics reveals that the teen skin care craze fueled by TikTok content may be harmful and expensive. Researchers analyzed beauty routines from 100 TikTok videos and found an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients in the regimens, with many lacking sunscreen. The average routine involved six steps and cost about $168 per month, raising concerns about unrealistic beauty standards and potential skin damage. Experts recommend gentle cleansers, fragrance-free moisturizers, and daily mineral sunscreen for teens, cautioning against anti-aging products and the overuse of active ingredients. The findings highlight the need for open conversations between parents and children about social media messages and the intentions behind purchasing skin care products. The study notes that many of the creators were offering tips relevant to those with lighter complexions, which may exclude the unique skin care considerations of darker complexions while perpetuating harmful ideals of “brighter” skin associated with whiteness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting citizens from a dozen countries mainly in Africa and the Middle East, has gone into effect. The ban fully restricts nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while partially restricting those from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Unlike the 2017 ban, this one is broader and expected to withstand legal challenges, though it has sparked criticism for its potential to disproportionately affect African countries and for being rooted in "bigotry."

          <p>India's ambitious $80 billion coal-power expansion is running into water scarcity issues, with many new projects planned for water-stressed areas. This expansion is intended to meet growing energy demands, but it exacerbates competition for limited water resources between industry and local residents. The locations of these plants are often determined by land availability rather than water access, leading to potential conflicts. While India is investing in renewable energy, coal-fired power remains dominant, posing significant challenges for water management. The article reflects on the challenges facing India's coal-power expansion. The vast majority of these new projects are planned for India's driest areas.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, arguing that it is an unnecessary and inflammatory action. The board notes that local law enforcement had largely maintained control over protests related to federal immigration raids, and that the deployment was not requested by state leaders. Invoking a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code, Trump claimed a rebellion was underway, a claim the board disputes, pointing to the January 6th Capitol attack as a more accurate example of rebellion. The editorial board sees Trump's actions as creating chaos and undermining state sovereignty. The article reflects on the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an extended ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The extension proposed by the government would cover 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs, and would protect rare marine animals and the delicate seabed they rely upon.</p>
