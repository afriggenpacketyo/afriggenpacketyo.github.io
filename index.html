          <h2>Small Businesses Advocate for Tariff Exemptions Amid Rising Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 18:22:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small businesses are seeking exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, arguing that they lack the financial cushion to absorb rising costs. Senator Ed Markey criticized the tariffs as recklessly imposed and highlighted the need to protect small enterprises, similar to how corporate giants like Apple and Google have been shielded. Isabel Guzman, former head of the SBA, emphasized that small businesses are more vulnerable to tariff challenges due to limited cash reserves and supply chain diversity. Some business owners report that tariffs are already jeopardizing their livelihoods, potentially forcing them to abandon orders and face significant financial losses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing its decision to terminate visas for hundreds of foreign students, a move that had sparked widespread fear and confusion among US universities. The reversal comes after over 100 lawsuits were filed by affected students, who were abruptly stripped of their legal right to study in the US. The Justice Department stated that immigration officials are working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas, restoring records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS). While ICE retains the authority to terminate SEVIS records for unlawful activity, attorneys for the students are relieved by this reprieve.</p>

          <p>California regulators have proposed new rules to permit the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads, potentially opening the state to autonomous vehicle technology already being explored in other states. The proposed regulations, subject to public comment, would apply to trucks over 10,001 lbs and include enhanced data-reporting requirements for manufacturers. This move is likely to face opposition from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job losses and pedestrian safety. Governor Newsom previously vetoed a bill requiring human drivers in self-driving semi-trailer trucks, arguing that existing laws were sufficient.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, claims to have saved $160 billion, but an analysis suggests that its actions may cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service (PSP) estimates that costs associated with paid leave for federal employees, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity are significant. The IRS, facing workforce cuts, could forego substantial tax revenue. While DOGE's cuts could yield long-term savings, critics argue that the costs, including reduced funding for research, may outweigh the benefits.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested a Milwaukee County judge, Hannah Dugan, on felony charges of interfering with immigration agents. Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by federal agents in her courtroom. This arrest highlights the tension between federal immigration enforcement and local courts, particularly in "sanctuary cities" where officials limit cooperation with federal authorities. The incident raises questions about the extent to which local officials can obstruct federal deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era. The dollar index has lost about 9% since President Trump's return to the White House, driven by his tariff policies and increased risk of a U.S. recession. The euro, Swiss franc, and yen have risen significantly against the dollar. Analysts are warning of a structural downtrend for the dollar in the coming years.</p>

          <h2>Poll Finds Voters See Trump's Use of Power as Overreaching</h2>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters believe President Trump is overreaching with his efforts to expand executive power. Majorities of voters view the early months of his administration as "chaotic" and "scary." The poll also shows dimming confidence in Trump's handling of key issues like the economy and immigration. His approval rating sits at 42 percent, a historically low level for a president at this stage in his term.</p>
