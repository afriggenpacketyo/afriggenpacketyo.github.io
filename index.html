          <p>Amazon's Zoox robotaxi unit issued a software recall for 270 of its robotaxis following a crash in Las Vegas last month. The recall addresses a defect in the automated driving system that could cause inaccurate predictions of other cars' movements, increasing the risk of a collision. The company paused driverless operations, investigated the incident, and implemented a software update across all Zoox vehicles to resume operations safely. The incident involved an unoccupied robotaxi colliding with a passenger vehicle, but no injuries were reported.</p>

Carney emphasized the value of partnership while rejecting any notion of Canada being acquired, drawing an analogy to Buckingham Palace as a property never for sale. Despite Carney's stance, Trump insisted that it would not complicate trade negotiations, adding, "never say never."</p>

          <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife officers killed three bears potentially responsible for a deadly attack on an 89-year-old man and his dog near Naples.

The memo also suggests that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling, further undermining the Trump administration's justification for deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer and Democratic allies are actively seeking candidates to contest Senate seats in traditionally Republican states, aiming to expand the electoral map for the 2026 midterms. While acknowledging President Trump's continued influence in many states, Democrats are exploring opportunities in areas where they believe strong, unconventional candidates could potentially upset the Republican stronghold. The strategy involves identifying individuals with the potential to appeal to a broad electorate and challenging the notion that red states are automatically out of reach for Democratic contenders, as reported by The New York Times.</p>

          <p>A couple visiting Boston alleges they were wrongly accused of inappropriate behavior in a women's restroom at the Liberty Hotel, leading to their removal from the premises. Ansley Baker, identified as a cisgender woman, was confronted by a security guard who claimed she was a man and did not belong in the women's restroom. The hotel, in a statement, claimed the couple was sharing a stall, which is against policy, and that one member of the couple became physical with security. Baker and her girlfriend, Liz Victor, dispute the hotel's account and have contacted the mayor's office to prevent similar incidents in the future, highlighting concerns for the safety and treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>Tesla sales in Germany and Britain experienced significant drops in April, reflecting a broader trend of declining demand in Europe despite overall growth in the electric vehicle market. Analysts suggest this decline is due to factors beyond just model changes, including President Trump's tariffs and growing disapproval of Elon Musk's political stances. While Chinese-made electric vehicles and European manufacturers like Volkswagen are gaining popularity, Tesla's market share is slipping. This comes as Tesla reported a substantial profit drop, prompting Musk to shift focus back to managing his companies.</p>
