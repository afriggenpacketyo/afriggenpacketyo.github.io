          <p>Thousands of anti-Israel demonstrators gathered in midtown Manhattan, chanting for a "global intifada," a phrase that many interpret as a call for violence against Jewish people. The protest has intensified the debate around the slogan's meaning, prompting bipartisan legislation in Congress that seeks to officially denounce the term as an incitement to violence. The proposed resolution aims to discourage leaders from using the chant and highlights the need to address rising antisemitic rhetoric across the country. This event underscores the deep divisions and heightened tensions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of their states' National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This action is in support of the Trump administration's declared emergency aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The deployment follows President Trump's recent move to place the city's metropolitan police department under federal control, a decision that has sparked significant controversy. The move is framed by supporters as necessary for restoring order, while opponents criticize it as an overreach of federal power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin underwent rapid intensification, strengthening from a tropical storm into a powerful Category 5 hurricane before slightly weakening to a Category 4. This rapid growth is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm ocean surface temperatures and low wind shear, factors amplified by climate change. While the storm's current trajectory is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Caribbean islands like the Leewards and Puerto Rico. Forecasters continue to monitor its path closely as it moves northward.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched peacefully in Washington, D.C., to oppose President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and his administration's attempt to take control of the city's police force. The demonstration followed a declaration of a "crime emergency" by the president, which critics argue is an exaggeration and an infringement on the city's home rule. Protesters voiced concerns about the lack of checks and balances on executive power, even after a federal lawsuit successfully blocked the appointment of an emergency police commissioner. Organizers have indicated that more demonstrations are planned for the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Following a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has reportedly shifted his stance, now urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a peace deal. This proposed agreement would bypass a ceasefire and move directly to a permanent settlement, which is said to involve Ukraine withdrawing from the Donbas region in exchange for Russia freezing the front lines elsewhere. This marks a significant change from the U.S.'s previous position and has caused concern among European allies and Ukrainians, who fear being pressured into ceding sovereign territory to end the war.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., may be armed, representing a significant update to their mission parameters. This development follows President Trump's emergency declaration aimed at addressing crime in the city. While the troops will be equipped with weapons, officials clarified that their role is not to make arrests but to protect federal property and provide a secure environment for law enforcement officers. This decision marks an escalation in the federal response and has heightened concerns among local residents and officials about the increased military presence.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a new surge in COVID-19 cases, with the national positivity rate hitting 9% and the Southwest region reaching 12.5%, the highest in the country. This spike is attributed to the highly contagious "Stratus" variant, which has become the dominant strain. The rise in infections coincides with students returning to school and a recent change in CDC policy, which no longer recommends updated COVID shots for all children. This policy shift has been criticized by numerous public health experts who argue it undermines efforts to control the virus's spread.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old woman from Merrimack, New Hampshire, was arrested after leading state troopers on a high-speed chase late Friday night. The pursuit began on Interstate 93 when a trooper observed her vehicle traveling at 93 mph without its lights on.

She now faces multiple charges, including reckless conduct and disobeying a police officer, and is being held until her arraignment. Fortunately, no injuries were reported during the incident.</p>

          <p>Across the United Kingdom, an unusually hot and dry summer is causing nature to show signs of stress, leading to what experts are calling a "false autumn." Trees are shedding their leaves prematurely and dropping branches to conserve water, while classic autumn fruits like blackberries are ripening weeks ahead of schedule. Conservationists are concerned about the long-term consequences for wildlife, as an early harvest of fruits could lead to food shortages for birds and other animals later in the winter. These phenomena are seen as clear indicators of the escalating impact of climate change on natural cycles.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" chronicles the final creative burst of Elvis Presley, focusing on his studio recordings in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period yielded his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," as well as poignant ballads like "Separate Ways" and "Always on My Mind," which reflected the turmoil of his personal life. The collection offers a look into the King's artistic state after his '68 comeback, a time when he was both a musical icon and increasingly disconnected from the rock culture he helped create. It captures his expressiveness as a singer before his career declined.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced its intention to move Palestinian civilians to the southern part of the Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed military offensive.

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, who was severely emaciated, has died in a hospital in Pisa, Italy, less than two days after being medically evacuated for treatment. She suffered a cardiac arrest, with the hospital noting severe weight and muscle loss, and news agencies reporting she was suffering from extreme malnutrition. Her death underscores the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and potential famine conditions. She was one of over 180 patients brought to Italy for care since the start of the war, as conditions in Gaza's damaged medical system continue to deteriorate.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share rising to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip series, which offer a new form factor beyond the traditional smartphone slate. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly models to premium foldables, is intensifying its competition with Apple in the high-end market.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that foundational environmental laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 are under threat and must be defended with renewed vigor. While the act has been successful in helping some species recover, many marine mammals face growing dangers from climate change, pollution, ship strikes, and entanglement in fishing gear. The article points to the declining gray whale population as a cautionary tale, warning that weakening these protections for economic interests would be a grave mistake. It concludes that protecting marine life is essential for the overall health of our oceans and, ultimately, ourselves.</p>
