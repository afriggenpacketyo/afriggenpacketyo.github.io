          <h2>Court Overturns Ruling Against Former TEPCO Executives in Fukushima Disaster Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 04:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for their alleged failure to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 decision that would have required the executives to pay approximately 13 trillion yen in compensation. The focal point of the trial was whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable, considering a TEPCO unit estimated in 2008 that a tsunami of up to 15.7 meters could hit the plant. The lawyer for the shareholders criticized the ruling as fundamentally flawed, expressing his intention to appeal the decision, while TEPCO apologized for the trouble caused by the nuclear accident but declined to comment on the lawsuit. Optimism surrounding the ruling is low, considering the previous ruling and the impact of the Fukushima disaster.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer Fabio Wardley is preparing for a significant match against undefeated Australian contender Justis Huni, while also anticipating the birth of his first child. Wardley, who will be fighting at the home of his beloved Ipswich Town Football Club, speaks candidly about the challenges and uncertainties of impending parenthood. At 19, Wardley was working in recruitment before dedicating himself to boxing, and a victory over Huni could move him closer to a world-title shot as early as 2026. Wardley's dedication and determination in his boxing career suggest he will approach fatherhood with the same mindset, ready to embrace the new journey.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radar signals, maintaining radio silence. The innovation, called a ‚Äúspace-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,‚Äù was unveiled in China‚Äôs Journal of Radars and enables a silent Cessna aircraft to detect moving vehicles with clarity, even in cluttered environments. Traditional methods struggle to filter out reflections from land, sea, or buildings, but this new tech clears the screen of noise, allowing for the clear detection of moving targets. This development marks a significant advancement in bistatic airborne radar technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce regulations mandating that the "vast majority" of new build homes in England must be fitted with solar panels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this move is "just common sense" and could save the typical household ¬£500 annually on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the government's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The new rules will be part of the Future Homes Standard, detailing broader plans for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction, with the government aiming for near-universal solar panel adoption on new homes to meet its net-zero target by 2050. The new regulations are likely to reduce carbon emissions and energy bills.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched extensive drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, resulting in at least three deaths and 49 injuries, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, Lutsk, and the Ternopil region, with Zelensky reporting that over 400 drones and 40 missiles were used in the attack. Kyiv's train system experienced disruptions due to shelling that damaged metro tracks, and Ternopil's military chief described the strike as the most massive air attack on the region to date. Russia's defense ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 174 Ukrainian drones in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea, with these attacks following Ukraine's recent drone strike on Russian warplanes at military bases.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has delivered a larger-than-expected cut to its benchmark policy rate, reducing it by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth amid global uncertainty. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra stated that the Indian economy presents a picture of strength, stability, and opportunity, despite holding the full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. While the central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year, it cautioned about weather-related uncertainties and evolving tariff concerns impacting global commodity prices. Given the substantial rate cut, the RBI will shift its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative," carefully assessing incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

The ban, backdated to April 2024, applies to Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water, with regulator Ofwat empowered to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that profiting from pollution is over, though concerns remain about companies potentially raising base salaries to circumvent the ban.</p>

However, economists suggest that the influx of these affordable goods could alleviate inflationary pressures for consumers in inflation-hit economies.

          <p>A recent call between U.S. and Chinese presidents has not yet resolved a looming global shortage of rare earth exports, which businesses fear could halt production of cars and other industrial parts this summer. China has come to dominate the mining and production of critical minerals, and has gradually started to restrict international sales. Despite a breakthrough trade agreement on May 12, China's Commerce Ministry held a meeting to strengthen export controls on critical minerals without broadly rolling back restrictions. The American Chamber of Commerce in China reports that 75% of affected members expect their supplies to run out within three months, impacting sectors like research and development, resources, industrial, and tech.</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges six common myths about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less."
