          <h2>Measles Vaccination Rates Decline in Most U.S. Counties, Study Reveals</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Johns Hopkins University highlights a decline in measles vaccination rates among children across 33 U.S. states, with 78% of the counties studied showing a decrease from the 2017-2018 to the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccination rate dropped from 93.92% to 91.26% during this period, with significant variations within and across states. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported nationwide, primarily in West Texas. Experts emphasize the vulnerability of communities with vaccination rates below the 95% herd immunity threshold, as highlighted by the outbreak's epicenter in Gaines County, Texas.</p>

          <p>The Broadway play ‚ÄúJohn Proctor Is the Villain,‚Äù set in a high school during the MeToo movement, is generating intense emotional responses, particularly among women, with many leaving performances in tears. The play revolves around an honors English class studying Arthur Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Crucible‚Äù and explores the complexities and tensions surrounding the MeToo movement through the experiences of high school girls. Playwright Kimberly Belflower was inspired by the MeToo movement and her own experiences growing up in rural Georgia, aiming to capture the moment before the backlash against the movement. The play's power lies in its ability to transport viewers back to a time when MeToo felt full of potential, offering a glimpse of hope that is now scarce.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is planning to hire more than 100 people after nearly 600 employees were laid off or retired as part of government-wide budget cuts earlier in the year. This reversal comes as the agency seeks to bolster its capacity to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts and warnings to the public. The NWS plays a crucial role in public safety, and the new hires will help to ensure that the agency can continue to fulfill its mission effectively.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a strong stock market rally in May, U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows indicate lingering investor skepticism about the strength of U.S. equities. While equity ETFs saw roughly $3 billion in daily inflows at the start of 2025, these inflows have more than halved to $1.4 billion since the market recovered from April losses. Investors are primarily seeking refuge in ultra-short duration assets, such as the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL). This trend suggests a cautious stance on stocks, potentially reflecting a "reset year" pattern from bull market history, where the third year often sees more cautious trading and a wider dispersion in returns across equity sectors.</p>

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, the Council of Fashion Designers of America CEO Steven Kolb, and the American Apparel & Footwear Association CEO Stephen Lamar, met with White House officials to discuss potential tariff relief. The fashion industry supports ten million American jobs and has historically paid high tariffs, prompting the discussion about balanced trade and maintaining these jobs in the U.S. The industry representatives aimed to address how tariffs have burdened the fashion sector, leading to increased prices on goods. There has been long-standing tension between Anna Wintour and Melania Trump, as the former First Lady was never featured on the cover of Vogue.</p>

He oversaw a team of Justice Department attorneys handling the large number of criminal cases following the Capitol riot, emphasizing the overwhelming evidence that led to convictions in jury trials.

The bill reduces outlays by more than $1.5 trillion against current baseline spending but still adds about $3.1 trillion to the debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The White House argues the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years, but some senators remain skeptical.</p>

Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current baseball player, criticized Ernst's leadership and plans to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy.

The sun is currently in the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, leading to more frequent and widespread light displays.

Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman.

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing concerns about due process. The ruling limits the administration's practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua under the 1798 law. The judge stated that the government has not provided adequate notice for individuals to challenge their deportation. This decision adds to the legal challenges surrounding the use of the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in other states also raising concerns about due process and the legality of invoking the law in this context.</p>

          <p>Officials have released new information regarding the attack on a group of demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, who were marching in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crimes charge after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at the crowd, injuring 12 people. The victims include a Holocaust refugee and a university professor. Soliman, an Egyptian national, had researched how to make Molotov cocktails and allegedly told investigators he "wanted to kill all Zionist people."</p>

          <p>The State Department has directed U.S. embassies and consulates to expand vetting for all visa applicants wishing to come to Harvard University, including students, faculty, and visitors. This "additional vetting" involves a complete screening of the online presence of applicants, with consular officers instructed to consider the lack of an online presence as a potential sign of evasiveness. The new procedure is intended to identify applicants "with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence" and may be expanded to other groups of visa applicants. The Trump administration has previously accused Harvard of failing to address antisemitic activity on campus and has taken measures to restrict funding and enrollment of foreign students.</p>

President Trump has prioritized the project, aiming to build an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet for gas export to U.S. allies in Asia. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes securing commercial offtakers will facilitate financing, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum says the Department of Defense is prepared to support the project.

Under the settlement, the Water Authority will pay a fixed price to MWD for delivering these supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, with annual adjustments for inflation.

The election, championed by Sheinbaum, aimed to elect judges in a nonpartisan manner, but the low participation rate has drawn criticism. Opponents have labeled the vote a "festival of voter fraud," while experts attribute the low turnout to various factors, including the lack of partisan affiliation and the complexity of the balloting process. Despite the low turnout, experts anticipate that the election will likely reinforce the power of Sheinbaum's Morena party in the judiciary.</p>
