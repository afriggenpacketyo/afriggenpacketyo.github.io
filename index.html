          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled six upcoming concerts in June due to an ongoing battle with the flu, expressing devastation and sincere apologies to his fans on Instagram. The 80-year-old singer reassured fans that he would return to the stage soon, signing his message as "Sir Rod." The canceled shows raised concerns about his performance at Glastonbury later this month, where he is scheduled to perform for the first time in over two decades. Stewart also canceled a performance at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace earlier this week due to doctor's orders, citing a lingering sickness. </p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities expanded their operations in the Los Angeles area, leading to protests and clashes with law enforcement.

The Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, criticized the actions as meant to "sow terror," while ICE defended its enforcement of immigration laws. Protesters gathered outside a federal detention center, demanding the release of those arrested and denouncing ICE's presence in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, resulting in at least three deaths and 40 injuries, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov, who described the attack as "open terror." The attack included 48 drones, two missiles, and four gliding bombs, following a wave of strikes across Ukraine in response to Kyiv's raids on Russian air bases. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha urged allies to increase pressure on Moscow and strengthen Ukraine, while President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strikes as "pure terrorism."

          <p>Opposition activists from Kenya allege they were detained and tortured in Tanzania, straining relations between the two countries. The activists, Boniface Mwangi and Agather Atuhaire, traveled to Tanzania to support imprisoned opposition leader Tundu Lissu. The Tanzanian government denies the accusations, claiming the activists violated law and order. This incident highlights the growing fear of protests and the challenges to cross-border economic cooperation extending to human rights solidarity in East Africa.</p>

Despite the dominant performance, analysts caution that tougher tests lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The series win raises questions about whether the "new" England team can perform under pressure when it matters most. The team has regularly dominated home bilateral series but has struggled on the big stage.</p>
