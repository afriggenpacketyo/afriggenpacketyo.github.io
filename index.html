          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on credible intelligence that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This action would represent a severe violation of the current ceasefire agreement brokered by the U.S. and could undermine recent progress toward stability. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting armed gangs in the region and creating a pretext for further conflict. The warning highlights the fragile security situation and the ongoing internal power struggles within Gaza.</p>

          <p>A group of thieves conducted a swift, brazen robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, breaking in shortly after its opening. The perpetrators smashed display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon and stole jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value," including pieces from the French Crown Jewels. The entire operation lasted only a few minutes, after which the thieves escaped on motorcycles, prompting a full museum closure and a major police investigation. No injuries were reported during the incident, which has raised concerns about security at the world-renowned institution.</p>

          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow highlights a severe crisis facing local journalism, with thousands of print newspapers having closed since 2005 and newsroom employment plummeting. The article argues that local news outlets provide essential "connective tissue" for communities, covering everything from local government accountability to high school sports and wedding announcements. Their disappearance contributes to growing political polarization, as nationalized news sources often frame issues in partisan terms. The loss of these institutions is presented as a threat to community cohesion and an informed citizenry.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stood by his characterization of the nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump as "hate America" rallies. In a television interview, Johnson clarified that his criticism was aimed at the protesters' message, not the individuals themselves, citing what he described as violent rhetoric. He also defended linking elements like anarchists and antifa to the modern Democratic Party, pointing to what he perceives as a rise of Marxism within the party. The comments reflect the deep political divisions and heated rhetoric surrounding the ongoing protests.</p>

          <p>The Haskell Free Library & Opera House, a unique institution intentionally built straddling the border between Vermont and Quebec, is facing new restrictions from the Trump administration. For over a century, the library has allowed Canadians and Americans to mix freely, but new rules now require Canadian visitors to use a designated port of entry instead of the main entrance on the U.S. side. The changes were implemented for security reasons following the death of a Border Patrol agent, but locals argue it undermines a long-standing symbol of unity and friendship.</p>

The breach did not occur on Discord's own servers but through a third-party customer service provider, 5CA, which was compromised by hackers. The attackers reportedly attempted to extort a ransom from Discord following the incident. The company has since terminated its contract with the vendor, notified affected users, and is working with law enforcement to investigate the security failure.</p>

          <p>AI safety-focused startup Anthropic is facing challenges on two fronts: competing with the larger, well-funded OpenAI and navigating political criticism from the U.S. government. David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" to promote regulations that would stifle innovation and benefit its own agenda. This contrasts with OpenAI, which has partnered with the White House on major infrastructure projects. The situation highlights the deep philosophical and political divisions within the AI industry regarding the balance between rapid development and safety-conscious regulation.</p>

          <p>With Medicare's open enrollment period underway, beneficiaries are encouraged to carefully evaluate their coverage for the upcoming year rather than automatically renewing their current plans. Experts stress the importance of checking for changes in costs, covered prescription drugs, and networks of doctors, as these can significantly impact out-of-pocket spending. While the ongoing government shutdown might cause some delays in accessing phone support, online resources like the Plan Finder remain available. Beneficiaries can switch between original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans until the December 7 deadline.</p>

Liu defended China's retaliatory fees on U.S. ships as a necessary measure to protect its own industry. The escalating trade tensions in the maritime sector are raising concerns about potential disruptions to international supply chains and the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch Trump loyalist, has recently taken positions that align her with Democrats and against her own party's leadership. She has criticized the Republican stance on the government shutdown, supported the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, and called for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. While she remains a supporter of President Trump, her independent streak on these issues has won her unlikely praise and sparked speculation about her motives. Greene maintains she is staying true to her populist roots by siding with her constituents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece argues that Democratic-led states should consider "fiscal disobedience" to counter the Trump administration's weaponization of federal power. The proposed strategy involves states creating escrow accounts to temporarily hold federal tax revenues from their residents instead of sending them directly to the IRS. These funds would be released only when the federal government ceases punitive actions, such as slashing funding to blue cities or deploying troops without state consent. The author suggests this would create material leverage and force a constitutional confrontation over the limits of federal authority.</p>

          <p>Autistic researchers and advocates are pushing back against the Trump administration's focus on unproven causes of autism, such as acetaminophen use.

Advocates state that the administration's rhetoric is not only unhelpful but also harmful, promoting eliminationist ideas instead of focusing on inclusion and support.

The campaign reportedly uses a network of Republican-tied strategists and pollsters to frame health-focused policies, such as restricting soda purchases with SNAP benefits, as an attack on consumer choice that angers Donald Trump's "MAGA" base. This strategy pits the industry against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement. The effort involves industry-funded polls, paid social media influencers, and articles placed in conservative media outlets to pressure lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of pickleball in the United States has been accompanied by a significant rise in eye injuries, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that the incidence of injuries like corneal abrasions and lacerations has increased dramatically, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors call for the development of standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which could prevent up to 90% of such injuries. The findings suggest that many players are unaware of the risks associated with the fast-paced, close-quarters nature of the sport.</p>

Surovtsev, who came to the U.S. as a child refugee from the former Soviet Union, was detained during a routine ICE check-in and now faces deportation to Ukraine, a country where he has never lived and holds no citizenship. His lawyers argue the detention is unconstitutional because there is no significant likelihood of his removal, as both Ukraine and Russia have previously been unable to confirm his citizenship.</p>
