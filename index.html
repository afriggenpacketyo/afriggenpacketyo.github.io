          <p>Jonathan Gluck, diagnosed with incurable blood cancer over 20 years ago and initially given 18 months to live, reflects on the valuable lessons he has learned about living a happy and meaningful life. He emphasizes the importance of enjoying life, handling challenges, and appreciating the goodness in people, especially doctors and nurses. Gluck advocates for pursuing important goals without delay and fighting for good relationships, even during tough times. He also stresses the significance of offering support to those who are sick and practicing acceptance of life's uncertainties, and while cancer isn't something he'd wish on anyone, almost dying has taught him some hard, but valuable lessons about how to live a happy, meaningful, and regret-free life.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, applied for 647 jobs over 18 months before finally securing a trainee accountant position in London. Frustrated by numerous rejections and lack of feedback, she questioned the value of her degree and work experience. Morgan believes that the use of AI in resume screening programs initially hindered her applications, as her CV was not optimized for these systems. Despite the challenges, she adjusted her CV, reached the assessment stage for 221 roles, and ultimately found a job that aligns with her career goals. The experience highlighted the competitive nature of the graduate job market, where finance roles receive an average of 188 applications each, and the importance of tailoring resumes to pass AI screening processes.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline after President Trump indicated that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran. This statement signals a potential easing of U.S. pressure on Iran following a ceasefire with Israel, leading to market speculation about increased oil supply. Global benchmark Brent crude fell by 4.66% to $68.15 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 4.64% to $65.33 a barrel. The price drop reflects investor confidence that a major supply disruption in the Middle East is now less likely, reversing the price surge that occurred after initial bombings in Iran.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic observers suggest that the U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities may reinforce Beijing's perception of the U.S. administration's unpredictability. Despite President Trump's campaign promises of an anti-war stance, the strikes call into question his commitment to ending U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts. The attacks could lead Beijing to believe that Washington might intervene in regional conflicts, prompting stronger strategic preparations in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. This shift from an anti-war position, despite a subsequent ceasefire announcement, highlights the challenges in interpreting U.S. foreign policy under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Quebec's universal childcare program, costing less than $7 a day, provides high-quality early education, supports working mothers, and benefits the government financially. The program, enacted in 1997, aims to provide equal opportunities for all children, especially those from low-income families, and has become a model for the rest of Canada. The Quebec approach was partly inspired by U.S. research highlighting the economic benefits of early childhood education. While the U.S. faces a growing childcare crisis, Quebec's success demonstrates the potential for public investment to create a win-win situation for families, educators, and the government.</p>

While some commenters supported the user's choice, citing the peaceful nature of cemeteries and historical precedents, others found it disrespectful to the deceased and their loved ones. An etiquette expert weighed in, stating that there is nothing wrong with finding peace and reflection in a cemetery, but it is important to be mindful of mourners' feelings.</p>

En route, Trump questioned Article 5, a core tenant of the alliance, and refused to commit to mutual defense. Prior to his departure, Iran conducted retaliatory strikes at a U.S. base in Qatar, but Trump reported no American casualties. The conflict is expected to dominate the summit, where Trump aims to increase defense spending across all member nations to 5% of their GDP, a move that has already faced resistance from some countries.</p>

He acknowledged that the tariffs are likely to increase prices and weigh on economic activity, but emphasized the Fed's commitment to preventing a one-time price increase from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.

          <p>Two young bears escaped from their enclosure at a U.K. wildlife park and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The bears, Mish and Lucy, were monitored during the hour-long incident, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building. The park's experienced team used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error" as the cause.</p>

          <p>While traveling to the Netherlands for a NATO summit, President Donald Trump declined to affirm his commitment to Article 5, the collective defense agreement among NATO countries. Trump claimed there are multiple interpretations of Article 5, raising concerns about the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance. He stated his commitment to being friends with NATO leaders and helping them, but did not provide a clear answer regarding mutual defense. His remarks are likely to raise concerns among other nations, particularly in light of recent international tensions.</p>

          <p>JD Vance suggested that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, close to weapons-grade, may still be intact despite the recent US bombing campaign. While the US targeted nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, reports indicate the uranium may have been moved elsewhere. Vance stated that the goal was to eliminate Iran's ability to convert the fuel into a nuclear weapon, claiming the bombing achieved "mission success."

Payouts are influenced by interest rates, with higher rates translating to stronger payouts. Fixed immediate annuities offer guaranteed monthly checks but don't account for inflation, while inflation-adjusted annuities keep pace with the Consumer Price Index but start with lower initial payouts.

          <p>A review of the film *28 Years Later* describes the sequel as a bold and audacious addition to the horror franchise, diverging significantly from its predecessors. The film, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, introduces more developed zombies and an odd, dense plot. The reviewer notes that the film is a reinvention of the zombie genre, with elements that are both fantastical and ludicrous. Despite its unconventional nature, the film is grounded in the protagonist's desire to save his mother and effectively explores how isolation reshapes the human mind.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that world leaders should stop trying to decipher President Trump's actions and motivations, comparing it to futile attempts to understand inscrutable behavior in relationships. The author suggests that Trump's actions are primarily driven by a desire for attention and control. Instead of trying to find hidden meanings in his behavior, leaders should recognize that everything is always about him. The piece encourages leaders to wake up and realize that Trump is not interested in a genuine partnership.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Germany will contribute its fair share to Europe's defense, emphasizing that Russia's President Putin only understands the language of force. The statement comes as NATO leaders arrive at the Hague summit, which aims to ensure peace in Europe for future generations. US President Donald Trump is attending his first NATO summit since 2019, where all 32 leaders are expected to commit to spending 5% of national output on defense. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte urged European colleagues to focus on investing in defense and supporting Ukraine, rather than worrying about the US commitment to the alliance.</p>
