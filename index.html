          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has firmly rejected offers from the United States to resume negotiations regarding its nuclear program, labeling any potential agreement as a form of coercion. This declaration comes as Middle East experts note that Iran's strategy of demonstrating strength could be backfiring, with its regional influence and proxy groups significantly weakened. Following the reinstatement of UN sanctions, Tehran has reduced cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Analysts suggest the Iranian leadership is in a dilemma, attempting to project strength without provoking a direct military strike from Israel or the US.</p>

          <p>A fact-check has determined that widespread social media claims of Germany canceling its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, despite isolated closures of smaller local events. Viral posts on platforms like TikTok and X alleged hundreds of markets were being shut down due to security costs, but investigations revealed that major cities like Berlin, Cologne, and Dresden are proceeding as planned. The origin of the rumor was traced to a single, unverified article from a little-known outlet that used AI-generated images and lacked credible sources. While security costs have risen, there is no evidence of mass cancellations across the country.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Offer Strategies for Coping with Seasonal Affective Disorder During Winter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 04:04:43 EDT</div>

          <p>As daylight hours shorten with the end of daylight saving time, many people, particularly in northern latitudes like Scotland, face challenges with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression is linked to reduced exposure to sunlight and can cause low mood, anxiety, and fatigue. To combat these effects, health projects are promoting new strategies, such as using therapeutic lamps, which are now being distributed from libraries in Orkney. Experts also recommend adopting a more positive psychological mindset towards winter, redesigning interior light environments to be more welcoming, and taking advantage of available daylight by spending time outdoors.</p>

          <p>In her posthumously released memoir, "Nobody's Girl," Virginia Giuffre provides a harrowing account of being sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The book includes a disturbing allegation of being sexually assaulted by an unnamed former prime minister on Epstein's private island, an event she describes as a turning point in her understanding of Epstein's cruelty. Giuffre also recounts non-abusive encounters with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where she first met Maxwell, and Bill Clinton, who she notes flew on Epstein's plane and attended dinners. The memoir aims to shed light on the powerful network that enabled the abuse she endured.</p>

          <p>Counting is underway in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to President Michael D Higgins. Voters went to the polls on Friday to choose between two main contenders: independent politician Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, remains on the ballot paper despite withdrawing from the race too late for his name to be removed. Early indications suggest that voter turnout may be low, potentially failing to surpass the record low of just under 40% set in the 2018 election, with the final result expected to be announced at Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein scandal continues to present political challenges for President Donald Trump, due to his documented friendship with Epstein in the 1990s. Despite Trump's efforts to distance himself from the affair, public and political pressure is mounting for the full release of the "Epstein files" by the Justice Department. The recent posthumous publication of survivor Virginia Giuffre's memoir has intensified this scrutiny. However, political analysts suggest that revelations may not significantly damage Trump's standing with his core supporters, who often view the entire political establishment as corrupt and apply a different standard to him.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" after the Pentagon deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean. The move represents a significant escalation of US military presence in the region, officially justified as part of an anti-drug trafficking operation. However, given that the US does not recognize Maduro's legitimacy and has labeled him the leader of a drug-trafficking organization, there are widespread fears in Venezuela that the buildup is a prelude to military action aimed at regime change. Maduro claims the US is seeking an "eternal war."</p>

At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's deep technical understanding and vision for creating non-robotic AI voices. This investment strategy of identifying technically proficient founders in unpopular sectors has been key to Reina's success.

          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, questions have arisen about whether a week-long break negatively impacted the team's performance. The Dodgers earned the extended rest by sweeping the National League Championship Series, but historically, teams in this position have struggled in the World Series. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, who had not pitched competitively in 10 and 14 days respectively, both had uncharacteristically poor outings. While the team officially denies that the layoff was a factor, the rust appeared evident and contributed to them trailing in a postseason series for the first time this year.</p>

Former allies are now criticizing his government for ignoring the middle class and protecting officials suspected of corruption. With his popularity ratings falling, Milei's ruling party faces a tight race against the resurgent Peronist opposition, which is capitalizing on growing public disillusionment with the economic pain.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing a severe and prolonged demographic decline, characterized by a shrinking and aging population, which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and an exodus of young men. In response, the Kremlin has intensified its promotion of "traditional family values," enacting restrictive laws that ban the promotion of abortion and "child-free ideology" while outlawing LGBTQ+ activism. Despite these measures and financial incentives for larger families, birth rates have continued to fall, hitting a two-century low in early 2025.

          <p>An analysis of the donors funding President Trump's new $300 million White House ballroom reveals that many are major corporations with significant business before the federal government. The list of contributors includes tech giants like Google and Microsoft, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, and cryptocurrency firms such as Coinbase and Ripple. This raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as these companies may be seeking favorable policy decisions, regulatory approval for mergers, or lucrative government contracts. The White House has defended the private funding model, stating that critics would complain if taxpayers were funding the project instead.</p>

          <p>As the US government shutdown extends into its 25th day with no resolution in sight, the Pentagon has confirmed its acceptance of a $130 million anonymous donation. The funds are explicitly conditioned to be used to offset the cost of salaries and benefits for the approximately 2 million service members who risk going without pay. President Trump revealed the donation came from a "friend" whom he called a "patriot." Meanwhile, Congress remains at an impasse, with the House of Representatives canceling votes for a fifth consecutive week, ensuring the shutdown will continue and federal workers will miss paychecks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has departed for a five-day trip to Asia, where he will attend summits and hold key trade talks, even as the US government remains partially shut down. The tour includes stops in Malaysia for the ASEAN summit, Japan, and South Korea for the APEC summit, where a highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled. The trip juxtaposes the administration's focus on foreign policy and international deals with a significant domestic crisis that has left many federal workers without pay. The ongoing shutdown has created a challenging backdrop for the president's diplomatic efforts abroad.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, providing a significant boost to the frontrunner's campaign just before early voting begins. Jeffries stated that he respects the will of primary voters and Mamdani's commitment to addressing the city's affordability crisis. The endorsement from the powerful Brooklyn Democrat consolidates support within the party for Mamdani, a Democratic socialist. This move comes shortly after Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, secured the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, setting the stage for the final phase of the election.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth during that period. The report highlights several key trends, including that U.S. births have been a primary driver of this growth and that the Latino population is the youngest of any major racial or ethnic group, with a median age of 31. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations in the country.</p>

          <p>A protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge turned violent when law enforcement officers fired at a U-Haul truck outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred after the driver allegedly reversed the vehicle erratically toward a line of security personnel, who opened fire after verbal commands were ignored. The driver was wounded and is being held for a mental health evaluation. The protest was organized in response to a planned, but later canceled, crackdown by Border Patrol agents in the San Francisco Bay Area, which had created a tense standoff throughout the day.</p>
