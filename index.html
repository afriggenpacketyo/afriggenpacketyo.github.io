          <p>Thirteen-year-old Faizan Zaki from Allen, Texas, emerged as the winner of the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee, succeeding after being the runner-up in the previous year's competition. Zaki correctly spelled "eclaircissement" to secure the title, outlasting eight other spellers in the final rounds. The competition saw moments of suspense as other finalists misspelled words, creating opportunities for Zaki to clinch the victory, which he ultimately seized with confidence and precision. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual event in the United States that brings together students from across the nation to test their spelling skills on a progressively challenging list of words, and it marked its 100th anniversary this year. Optimism surrounds the future for Faizan Zaki as he continues his education. </p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's Police Commissioner during the 9/11 terror attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik's career began with the NYPD in 1986, culminating in his role as the 40th commissioner from 2000 to 2001 under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and he later served in Iraq as the head of a provisional police force in 2003. Despite his rise in law enforcement, Kerik's legacy was marred by a guilty plea to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2009, leading to a prison sentence, though he was later pardoned by President Trump in 2020. Kerik's passing has prompted reflections on his contributions to New York City and his complex career trajectory, with many remembering his service during a critical period in the city's history. </p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new arena for conflict in the rivalry between China and the United States. While Lian believes that full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, he suggests that Washington might gradually target specific Chinese entities, potentially leading to China's exclusion from the U.S. dollar system. Lian also noted that excluding China from the SWIFT system could significantly damage the system itself, as countries with trade and investment ties to China might shift to using China's alternative, CIPS. This warning underscores the growing concerns about the potential for financial warfare between the two economic giants. </p>

Trump also expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, suggesting they provided poor advice on judicial nominations. Leo, who formerly advised Trump on Supreme Court picks, responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts. </p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year, with positive sentiment dropping from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. The survey indicated that nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, while some 27% expect business travel spending to decrease. Concerns about business travel costs and visa processing problems are driving these changes, with a third of business travel buyers reporting that their companies have altered or are considering altering policies regarding travel to or from the United States. The report also showed that some companies have relocated events from the U.S. to other countries. </p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours with only minor injuries, thanks to his wife's quick thinking and a stroke of luck. Morris' wife held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers to arrive after the boulder crashed onto him during a hike near Godwin Glacier. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and offered its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible to all-terrain vehicles. Rescuers used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder off Morris, who was then airlifted to a hospital and later released unscathed. </p>

          <p>President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs is under threat as a court fight challenges his use of emergency powers. The US Court of International Trade ruled that he exceeded the authority of the emergency powers he was using, giving the White House 10 days to remove almost all tariffs, though this ruling was stayed by a federal appeals court. The administration argues that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. Trump has defended his use of tariffs, arguing that they are necessary to address economic problems and revive American manufacturing. </p>
