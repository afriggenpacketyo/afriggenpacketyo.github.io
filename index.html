          <h2>Colorado Man Receives Life Sentence for Fatal Drunk Driving Incident</h2>

          <p>A 57-year-old man in Colorado has been sentenced to life in prison plus 92 years for a drunk driving crash that killed an Air Force veteran and injured his four children. The incident occurred in August 2024 when the man, who had a blood alcohol level 2.5 times the legal limit, crashed his truck into the family's vehicle at a gas station. This conviction marked his third DUI, and the district attorney pursued a first-degree murder charge to send a strong message against drunk driving. The victim's family expressed that the verdict provides a small amount of closure for their loss.</p>

          <p>As Germany's key manufacturing index shows signs of a slow recovery, the European Union is growing more concerned about protecting its industrial base from Chinese competition. Analysts suggest that Europe's desire to rebuild its own manufacturing sector is a central factor in its relationship with Beijing, as it cannot afford a large influx of inexpensive Chinese imports. While the EU remains a major global manufacturing power, with an output of $2.72 trillion in 2024, it faces an uphill battle to regain its former glory amidst China's dominant $4.66 trillion output.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders have expressed strong outrage following the House passage of a major Republican tax and spending bill, framing it as a betrayal of ordinary Americans in favor of billionaires. Critics like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez highlighted that the legislation provides permanent tax breaks for the wealthy while cutting social benefits, such as Medicaid and food assistance. The bill also dramatically increases funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), making it larger than several other federal agencies combined. Democrats are signaling these points will be central to their campaigns for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the recently passed Republican budget bill is a perverse outcome of American politics, as a measure that seems widely disliked and harmful was passed with little effective resistance. The author contends that despite concerns over its massive deficit increase and deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, most Republicans ultimately fell in line with Donald Trump's demands. The legislation is described as a transfer of wealth from the sick, poor, and elderly to billionaires and immigration enforcement, which will profoundly and cruelly reshape American life.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," calling it the best possible birthday present for America. During the event, he championed the bill's tax cuts and border security funding while deriding the Democratic opposition. Trump also used the rally to kick off plans for the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026, announcing a "Great American State Fair" and a plan to host a UFC fight on the White House lawn. In a policy shift, he also suggested he would allow some migrant farm laborers to remain in the U.S.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu is preparing for a significant challenge at Wimbledon as she faces world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round. After a strong victory over the 2023 champion, Raducanu acknowledged the need to elevate her game and add more "weapons" to compete with the sport's top stars. Sabalenka is the overwhelming favorite, known for her powerful serve and dominant baseline game that has seen her reach at least the quarterfinals in her last ten Grand Slam appearances. Raducanu hopes that playing on grass and having the support of the home crowd will help her bridge the gap.</p>

          <p>Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has admitted to feeling nervous ahead of the band's final farewell performance at Villa Park in their home city of Birmingham. The concert will feature the original lineup playing together for the first time in 20 years, an event Iommi described as "totally different from anything else we've done." He noted that while preparations have gone well, the two-hour performance is physically demanding for the aging rock legends. Iommi confirmed this will be the band's last show, hoping to finish on a high note in front of 40,000 fans.</p>

          <p>A strike by refuse workers in Birmingham has now lasted for six months, leaving residents to contend with apocalyptic piles of uncollected rubbish and a persistent stench. The industrial action by the Unite union began over council plans to downgrade some roles to address equal pay liabilities, and there is still no deal in sight. The city has suspended kerbside recycling and green waste collections, and its recycling rate has plummeted to the lowest of any major authority in England. Residents without cars are struggling to dispose of their waste, as many tips do not allow pedestrian access.</p>

In a BBC interview, Starmer revealed that Trump had called to console him after his brother's death, and he believes this personal connection is in the national interest and has helped secure vital trade deals. He asserted that this rapport was instrumental in getting UK industries exempted from some of Trump's sweeping tariffs. The comments aim to portray Starmer as a pragmatic leader capable of building relationships with ideologically different world figures.</p>

          <p>The newly passed Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill" is a massive legislative package that fulfills many of Donald Trump's key campaign promises through a combination of tax cuts and major spending initiatives. The bill allocates billions to increase immigration enforcement, resume border wall construction, and boost military spending, while also incentivizing fossil fuel production. To fund this, the legislation makes significant cuts to social programs, with new eligibility rules for Medicaid and food aid that could cause millions to lose coverage. While a political victory for Trump, the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A jury in Oregon has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of first-degree sexual assault and other related charges. The conviction stems from an incident in October 2021, when McLemore assaulted a 21-year-old woman at a lake house party attended by his then-teammates from the Portland Trail Blazers. Prosecutors argued the woman was incapacitated from heavy drinking and unable to consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The district attorney stated the verdict demonstrates that celebrity status does not shield individuals from prosecution for criminal acts in their jurisdiction. McLemore is scheduled for sentencing next week.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially become the first country in the world to formally recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move the Taliban's foreign minister called "courageous." The decision was conveyed by Russia's ambassador in Kabul and marks a significant diplomatic shift nearly four years after the Taliban returned to power. Since their takeover in 2021, the Taliban have sought international recognition despite widespread condemnation of their human rights abuses, particularly the severe restrictions placed on women and girls. Russia, which has kept its embassy open in Kabul, sees potential for economic cooperation with the regime.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's announcement that he plans to host a large-scale UFC fight on the White House lawn for the nation's 250th anniversary has been met with criticism and ridicule. The plan, revealed at an Iowa rally, would involve an audience of up to 25,000 spectators for a championship mixed-martial arts event organized by UFC CEO Dana White. Critics quickly took to social media to pan the idea as undignified and beneath the office of the presidency, with many comparing the proposal to something from the dystopian comedy film "Idiocracy." Trump has a long-standing relationship with White and the UFC.</p>
