            <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell Over Interest Rate Policy</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-17 10:36:20 EDT</div>

            <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates, claiming Powell is "too late and wrong." Trump argues that lower rates are needed, citing falling oil and grocery prices, and the supposed economic benefits of tariffs. However, reports contradict Trump's claims about tariff revenue and grocery prices. Powell has voiced concerns that Trump's tariffs will lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, creating a potential conflict between the White House and the independent Federal Reserve.

            <p>President Trump escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that Powell's "termination cannot come soon enough." This remark followed Powell's warnings about the negative economic impact of Trump's tariff policies, including potential stagflation. Trump's attacks on Powell, despite the Fed's supposed independence, echo his first term's sentiments. Experts note that while the President can remove a Fed governor "for cause," policy disputes are unlikely to meet that standard, highlighting the ongoing tension between the White House and the central bank.</p>

            <p>Mitchells & Butlers (M&B), the owner of Toby Carvery, has issued an apology for cutting down a 500-year-old oak tree near one of its pubs in Enfield, admitting the company needs to tighten its protocols.

M&B initially claimed the tree was dead and posed a safety risk, but later amended their statement. The incident has sparked outrage among local residents and environmental groups, prompting a review of the company's procedures.</p>

            <p>The Texas Senate passed a bill that would ban nearly all consumable hemp products containing THC, the main intoxicating element in cannabis, reversing a previous legalization that spurred a multi-billion dollar industry.

            <p>Campaigners warn that the UK Supreme Court's ruling defining "woman" as biological sex could have "dire consequences" for the safety and well-being of trans people. The ruling, stemming from a case brought by For Women Scotland, has sparked fears that trans individuals may lose access to single-sex spaces and services, despite holding Gender Recognition Certificates (GRCs). The EHRC is updating its code of conduct to reflect the ruling, while trans rights advocates express concern that the decision will fuel a culture war and undermine the rights of trans people.</p>
