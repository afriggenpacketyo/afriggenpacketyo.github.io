          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid his trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The decision came after a judge ruled Bolsonaro violated previous precautionary measures by using his sons' social media to communicate with supporters. The case has attracted international attention, with the U.S. Trump administration condemning the court's order and imposing trade tariffs on Brazil, escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 after a strong start from pitcher Tyler Glasnow was wasted by a shaky bullpen. Glasnow allowed only one run over seven innings, but the Cardinals took the lead in the eighth and secured the win with a go-ahead single in the ninth. Despite a fourth-inning solo home run from Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome the Cardinals' pitching and relief efforts, leading to a frustrating defeat at home.</p>

Croatia celebrates it as a heroic victory and a foundational moment for the nation, recently holding a large military parade in Zagreb. In contrast, Serbia commemorates the anniversary as a tragedy, viewing the operation as a pogrom that led to the mass expulsion and murder of ethnic Serbs from the Krajina region.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting in Geneva to negotiate a legally binding global treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution. After two years of talks, significant disagreements remain, particularly between a coalition of countries pushing for production caps and oil-producing nations who favor focusing on recycling. The treaty seeks to address the entire lifecycle of plastic, from production and harmful chemical content to waste management, as scientific evidence of its environmental and health damage grows.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Poland's liberal democratic government, led by Donald Tusk, is at risk of failing less than two years after ousting the populist Law and Justice party. The author contends that by maintaining some populist policies, failing to deliver on key promises like liberalizing abortion laws, and lacking an inspiring vision, the government is losing public support. This trend suggests the current administration may become a brief interlude before a potential return of right-wing populism.</p>

          <p>A sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, is under internal investigation after posting a controversial video on TikTok while in uniform. The deputy, Jennifer Escalera, posted a clip with a caption that used slang to imply her professional conduct, specifically her issuance of traffic tickets, was influenced by her personal sex life. The video quickly went viral and sparked public outrage, with many criticizing the post as highly unprofessional and a betrayal of public trust.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could force many towns to transition to costly paid departments. The number of volunteers has declined by over 20% since 1985, while the volume of emergency calls has more than tripled, leading to burnout among remaining crews. To address the crisis, some lawmakers are proposing incentives such as student loan forgiveness to help recruit and retain the next generation of volunteer first responders.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlights Taiwan's significant energy vulnerabilities in the event of a military blockade by China. The analysis, based on war-gaming scenarios, concluded that Taiwan's natural gas reserves would last only about two weeks, with coal lasting seven weeks and oil 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would be a high-risk, high-cost option for Beijing, with a strong likelihood of escalating into a broader, more destructive conflict.</p>

Trump's endorsement of the ad and Sweeney, whom he called a "registered Republican," fueled the debate and caused American Eagle's stock to surge over 20%.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has issued a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were discovered with blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. Lab tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by the ingestion of diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target wildlife from accessing bait and are advising hunters to avoid consuming any game animal that shows signs of such contamination.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among Americans aged 45 to 49. This positive trend is attributed to the updated recommendation to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, which led to a 62% jump in screenings for that age group. The findings underscore the success of the public health initiative in catching cancer earlier, though experts note that overall screening rates still remain suboptimal.</p>

In a letter to the President, the lawmakers argue that the current crisis highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and that recognition is crucial for regional stability. The letter proposes a framework where a new Palestinian state would fully recognize Israel and guarantee its security, reflecting a growing international push.</p>

          <p>Maui firefighters have been battling a brush fire that ignited near Ka'anapali, just a few miles north of the area devastated by the 2023 Lahaina wildfires. The blaze prompted the temporary closure of both lanes of the Honoapiʻilani Highway to facilitate firefighting efforts. Officials reported that the fire was slowly being contained, but smoke continued to affect the highway, raising concerns in a community still recovering from the previous year's catastrophic fires.</p>
