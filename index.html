          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence of a near miss incident involving a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over international waters. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi conveyed Japan's "serious concern" to China, emphasizing the potential for a collision. China insists its military activities comply with international law, blaming Japanese reconnaissance activities for security risks. The incident involved a Chinese J-15 warplane flying close to a Japanese P-3C patrol plane, raising concerns about safety in the region. Japan remains vigilant amid increased Chinese military activity. The overall stability of the region is at risk due to these military tensions.</p>

          <p>The government's Spending Review aims to foster long-term economic growth through capital spending, but faces the challenge of public impatience for immediate change. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the public's desire for change, highlighting initiatives like expanded free school meals. The government's strategy hinges on achieving sustained economic growth, which is currently hindered by sluggish GDP figures. Critics suggest that the review's emphasis on long-term investments may not address the immediate needs of an electorate feeling financially strained.

          <p>UAE oil giant ADNOC is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a potential takeover of the energy major. BP has faced underperformance relative to industry peers, making it an attractive target. ADNOC's interest is seen as a significant development given its growing, cash-rich business and existing relationship with BP. BP is seeking to restore investor confidence through a strategic reset, which includes increasing oil and gas spending while reducing renewables investment. The company aims to fend off a potential takeover by improving its financial performance.</p>

          <p>The recent protests in Los Angeles against immigration raids reflect a broader tension between state power and public compliance, recalling Hannah Arendt's analysis of authoritarianism. The protests were sparked by border patrol actions in a predominantly Latino area, leading to the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and Marines. While protests can be used by authoritarian rulers to justify displays of force, the alternative is to allow unjust actions to proceed unchallenged. The protests aim to prevent the arrest of community members, highlighting the importance of action and hope in the face of repression. The situation underscores the need to resist conditions of fear and hopelessness.</p>

          <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has warned that some Jolly Rancher sweets are unsafe to eat due to the presence of chemical compounds, mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH), which are non-compliant with UK laws. MOAH can cause DNA damage and increase the risk of cancer, particularly with prolonged consumption. The FSA is urging UK businesses and consumers to stop buying and selling the affected products, which include Jolly Rancher Hard Candy and Jolly Rancher Gummies. Consumers are advised to dispose of the products and notify Trading Standards or environmental health departments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is partially evacuating its embassy in Baghdad due to heightened security risks, with non-essential staff and their dependents being removed. This decision comes as U.S. talks over Iran's nuclear program appear to have stalled. Officials have stated that Israel is ready to launch an operation into Iran, which could prompt retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. The U.S. State Department is constantly assessing personnel posture at embassies and decided to reduce the mission's footprint in Iraq. President Trump reiterated that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>

Gyokeres previously played for Brighton without making a single Premier League appearance, before loan spells in the Championship and Germany.

          <p>China's recent debut in mass-producing high-performance photonic chips is expected to position the country for major advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's CHIPX has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips. TFLN is known for its ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption. The breakthrough is the result of nearly 15 years of effort and may overcome global limits for high-speed optical links. The progress highlights China's growing capabilities in advanced technologies.</p>

          <p>India's central bank plans to tighten regulations on overseas remittances by resident Indians, preventing them from holding foreign currency deposits with lock-in periods.

The RBI's move is part of a comprehensive review of the legal framework governing the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).

          <p>South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, faces the challenge of ending the cycle of political revenge that has plagued the country's leadership.
