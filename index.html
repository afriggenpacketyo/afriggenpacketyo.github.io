          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year career in the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, deployed a government satellite for monitoring greenhouse gases before its retirement. This series, which had a 98% success rate, is being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. The new H3 is intended to make Japan more competitive in the global satellite-launch market, which is currently dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Following its recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran's government has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing several men accused of spying for Israel and arresting hundreds more. Human rights activists report that those executed were denied due process and that the regime is instilling a climate of fear to suppress dissent. Citizens express concern that the government is taking revenge on its own people after suffering significant military and infrastructure losses. The regime has also implemented new surveillance measures, creating what state media calls an "intelligence jihad" to monitor online activities.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered faint, ancient radio signals originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049, which took 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This finding suggests that the energetic processes shaping the universe, such as supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, were active much earlier than previously thought. The discovery opens a new window into the evolution of galaxy clusters in the early universe.</p>

While his workload is still being carefully managed following his second Tommy John surgery, this outing was his most impressive yet, demonstrating a powerful and effective return to his two-way role.

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, while the U.S. maintains a significant lead in AI chip technology, China is quickly catching up in the development of sophisticated algorithms. Speaking at an economic summit, the former head of AI at Microsoft noted that computing power remains a major challenge for Chinese firms due to chip constraints. However, he highlighted the success of Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors using far fewer resources. This suggests China is making significant progress in algorithm engineering despite hardware limitations.</p>

Concurrently, the court reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the Trump administration.

The evidence indicates that husbands likely relocated to their wife's household after marriage and that grave goods were offered preferentially to females. This discovery challenges the common Western assumption of patrilineal societal structures and points to a system where identity and rights were passed through the mother.</p>
