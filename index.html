          <p>President Trump has announced a second U.S. military strike in international waters against a boat allegedly carrying narcotics from Venezuela. The operation, conducted under the U.S. Southern Command, reportedly resulted in the deaths of three individuals described as "male terrorists" transporting illicit drugs. This action follows a similar strike that occurred two weeks prior, reinforcing the administration's aggressive stance against drug trafficking in the Caribbean. The President issued a stern warning that the U.S. will continue to target those involved in transporting drugs.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded significantly, closing Monday at a price that erases all its losses for the year. The shares have surged 85% from a low point in April, a recovery bolstered by CEO Elon Musk's recent purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of company stock. Despite this rally, the electric vehicle manufacturer is still navigating a multi-quarter sales slump due to an aging product line and increased competition. The company is also attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots to sustain its growth narrative. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate, this article explains the indirect relationship between the Fed's policies and mortgage rates. The central bank controls the short-term federal funds rate, while fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note. Although a Fed rate cut doesn't guarantee an immediate drop in mortgage costs, lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of such moves. Experts suggest that future guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have a more significant impact on the market than the cut itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former MMA fighter Conor McGregor has announced he will not be a candidate in Ireland's upcoming presidential election, citing the need for "careful reflection" after consulting with his family. McGregor, who has become a prominent anti-immigration voice, claimed the country's political rules are "fixed" against non-establishment candidates. His withdrawal follows recent legal troubles, including losing an appeal in a civil case where a woman claimed he had sexually assaulted her in 2018.

The suspect, a Cuban national, was under a final deportation order but remained in the U.S. because Cuba refused to accept him due to his criminal record. Trump stated the individual should never have been in the country and highlighted his administration's policy of deporting individuals to third-party countries when their home nations refuse them.

This year's calculations may be more complex for some due to tax changes enacted by the Trump administration, which could lead to overpayment if not properly adjusted. To avoid underpayment penalties, taxpayers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's.

Her case is one of many legal challenges from DOJ employees terminated during the current administration.</p>

          <h2>New England's Shrimp Fishery Faces Extended Shutdown Amid Population Decline</h2>

          <p>The New England shrimp industry is facing the possibility of a longer moratorium after fishermen found very few of the crustaceans during a recent sampling program. The fishery has been largely closed for over a decade due to low population levels, which scientists attribute to the warming waters of the Gulf of Maine. Regulators now have the authority to extend the shutdown for five years at a time, a change from the previous annual reviews. The continued poor condition of the shrimp stock casts doubt on the future of what was once an iconic regional seafood delicacy.</p>

          <p>The New England Revolution have fired head coach Caleb Porter after a period of poor results left the team unlikely to make the MLS playoffs. The decision followed a 1-1 draw against Toronto FC, continuing a season where the team has struggled significantly. Porter was in charge for less than two seasons, during which the team's performance did not meet expectations despite a major roster overhaul. Assistant coach Pablo Moreira will serve as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season while the club begins its search for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is facing scrutiny for his use of social media during the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing. Critics, including former FBI agents, have raised concerns about his frequent and sometimes premature posts, such as an incorrect announcement that a suspect was in custody shortly after the shooting. This approach marks a significant departure from the traditionally cautious communication style of previous FBI directors. While Patel and his deputy defend their actions as a commitment to transparency, some veterans of the bureau argue that it could jeopardize active investigations and undermine the agency's credibility.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting to bypass legal protections for asylum seekers by deporting a group of African migrants to Ghana, a third country. The deportees, who are not Ghanaian nationals, have legal orders preventing their removal to their home countries due to fears of persecution or torture. Attorneys argue that Ghana is now planning to return them to those very nations, and Judge Tanya Chutkan has ordered the U.S. government to explain what it is doing to prevent this. The case highlights the controversial use of third-country deportation agreements.</p>

          <p>Israel's ongoing war in Gaza is leading to increasing international isolation, with comparisons being drawn to the pressure faced by apartheid-era South Africa. Several European nations, including Belgium and Spain, have imposed sanctions, such as import bans from West Bank settlements and arms embargoes. At the UN, multiple countries plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state, while cultural and sporting boycotts are also emerging. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government remains defiant, former Israeli diplomats express deep concern over the country's deteriorating global standing, though some analysts believe it has not yet reached a critical tipping point.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed that public companies report their earnings on a semi-annual basis instead of quarterly, arguing it would save money and encourage long-term strategic thinking. While many corporate executives support the idea, citing the pressures of short-term profit targets, investor advocates and finance experts express concern. Critics warn that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency, increase market volatility, and potentially create more opportunities for insider trading or accounting fraud. Any change to the current SEC mandate, which has been in place since 1970, would require a lengthy regulatory process.</p>

          <p>This article details the experience of a borrower whose federal student loans were transferred to a new servicer, Central Research Inc. (CRI), with little advance notice. This situation is becoming more common as the Department of Education shifts accounts among its contracted servicers. When loans are transferred, they are often placed in a temporary administrative forbearance, which can cause confusion for borrowers. Experts advise borrowers to save their payment amounts during the transfer period and pay once the new account is fully active to avoid potential issues, and to verify their credit reports afterward for any errors.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have been on a downward trend, recently hitting a near-yearly low, and could fall further this week. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut, which lenders have likely already started pricing into their mortgage offers. While a standard 25-basis-point cut is anticipated, a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction could lead to a more significant drop in mortgage rates. Prospective homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely, as these lower rates may not last long, and to ensure their credit score is strong to qualify for the best offers.

          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows that wind and solar are more affordable to generate than fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While renewables have high initial capital costs, their operational expenses are very low. The debate over energy policy continues, with the current administration's tariffs potentially increasing costs for projects reliant on imported components, especially battery storage.</p>

          <p>As annuities grow in popularity for retirement planning, understanding how to access the funds within them is crucial for account holders. This article outlines seven strategic ways to get money out of an annuity, including waiting for scheduled payments to begin, making partial penalty-free withdrawals, or surrendering the contract for its cash value. Other options involve taking a loan, using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a new contract, or selling future payments to a third party. Each strategy comes with different tax implications, fees, and impacts on long-term financial security that should be carefully evaluated. (not investment advice)</p>
