        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area, temporarily freezing a lower court's order. The district court had previously barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argued the injunction hindered law enforcement, while dissenting justices warned the decision allows the government to "seize anyone who looks Latino." This ruling comes amid the administration's broader campaign for mass deportations in a region it considers a top enforcement priority.</p>

The company plans to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." The move signals a rebound in the IPO market after a period of uncertainty. This is StubHub's latest attempt to go public, having previously postponed its efforts in 2024 due to market volatility.

          <p>Reach, the company that owns major UK newspapers including the Daily Mirror and Daily Express, has announced plans to eliminate over 300 jobs. The move is part of a significant overhaul aimed at increasing the use of video and artificial intelligence (AI) while focusing on digital subscriptions. The restructuring will result in 321 redundancies but also create 135 new roles. A key part of the new strategy involves creating a "live news network" where a single journalist can produce breaking news content for multiple publications simultaneously.</p>

          <p>Following the collapse of its government, France's significant fiscal problems are raising concerns about a potential new debt crisis in the eurozone. The nation's sovereign debt has reached approximately €3.35 trillion, about 113% of its GDP, and it runs the largest budget deficit in the EU. Financial markets have responded with higher risk premiums on French bonds, reflecting investor anxiety. While some economists believe the immediate risks are manageable, they warn that prolonged political deadlock could prevent necessary economic reforms, potentially destabilizing Europe's second-largest economy and the single currency.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted the Trump administration an interim stay, allowing it to proceed with the removal of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter for now. A lower court had previously ordered Slaughter's reinstatement, finding her firing unlawful under a law that limits a president's power to remove commissioners. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to challenge the independence of various federal agencies. The Supreme Court will take more time to consider the administration's request to fully lift the lower court's order.</p>

          <p>The French government has collapsed after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a parliamentary confidence vote, plunging the nation into renewed political uncertainty. The crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election gamble, which resulted in a hung parliament unable to pass key legislation, including necessary budget cuts to address France's massive public debt. Macron must now either appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years or call another risky snap election. This instability threatens France's ability to tackle its economic challenges and maintain its leadership role within the European Union.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit $4 Billion in Foreign Aid Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has urgently requested that the Supreme Court allow it to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid that Congress has already allocated. A lower court previously ruled that the administration had a legal obligation to spend the funds, a decision an appeals court declined to freeze. The administration is attempting to use a rarely invoked legislative tool to cancel funding for programs it deems misaligned with its objectives. The Solicitor General argued the lower court's injunction represents a "grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers."</p>

          <p>An Ebola outbreak of the Zaire strain has killed 16 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 28 suspected cases confirmed. The World Health Organization (WHO) is working to contain the spread, but a regional official warned that recent U.S. funding cuts "will definitely have an impact" on the global response capacity. The Trump administration's decision to pull out of the WHO has fueled concerns about the ability to manage deadly diseases and prevent them from crossing borders. The outbreak adds pressure to Congo's already strained healthcare system, which is also battling a major mpox epidemic.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has stated that the party must choose a woman from outside London to be its next deputy leader. The party has announced an accelerated timeline for the leadership contest, which is seen as a battle over Labour's future direction. Baroness Harman argued the role requires someone who can complement the party leader, broaden his reach, and galvanize members. The contest was triggered after Rayner resigned over a breach of the ministerial code, prompting a major cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million jury verdict against President Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The three-judge panel unanimously rejected Trump's arguments that he was protected by presidential immunity and that the damages awarded were excessive. The court affirmed that the jury's conclusion was "fair and reasonable" given the "extraordinary and egregious facts" of the case. This ruling marks another significant legal defeat for Trump in the long-running legal battle initiated by Carroll after he denied her sexual assault allegations.</p>

          <p>American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to a record low, according to the New York Federal Reserve's August Survey of Consumer Expectations. The perceived probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped sharply to 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant cooling of the labor market and a reversal of the "Great Resignation" trend. The sentiment aligns with recent government reports showing a dramatic slowdown in hiring, leading workers to "job-hug" their current positions amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
