          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move to invigorate its underperforming U.S. coffee business. Following the acquisition, anticipated in the first half of 2026, the company intends to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed entities, effectively reversing the 2018 Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple merger. This restructuring is projected to yield $400 million in cost synergies over three years and aims to broaden its market appeal, particularly among thrifty at-home coffee drinkers and new cold coffee consumers. The announcement led to an 11% drop in Keurig Dr Pepper's stock, contrasting with a 15% rise for JDE Peet's shares.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, clarified to CNBC that he is not in the market to acquire another railroad but recently met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to explore greater cooperation for freight rail efficiency. This discussion follows a new partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX, aiming to achieve similar operational benefits as a merger without the premium cost. The announcement caused CSX shares to drop by approximately 5%, with Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern also experiencing declines, as earlier speculation about a potential Berkshire takeover had inflated their stock prices. Buffett's statement provides a clear direction for his involvement in the railroad sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Raja Jackson, son of former UFC champion Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, is under police investigation after a livestreamed wrestling event in Los Angeles saw him allegedly launch an unscripted attack on opponent Stuart Smith. Video shows Jackson slamming Smith and delivering multiple punches, prompting others to intervene. Event organizers stated the incident was not planned, contradicting Quinton Jackson's initial claim that his son was seeking "payback" for a prior confrontation. Smith reportedly suffered several broken facial bones and lost teeth, leading the LAPD to open a felony battery report, though no arrests have been made.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) fiercely criticized Democratic lawmakers for their support of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national detained by ICE for deportation. DHS labeled Garcia a "criminal illegal alien" and a "public safety threat," accusing Democrats of glorifying an alleged MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, domestic abuser, and child predator. This article highlights the Trump administration's strong stance against sanctuary politicians and their perceived interference in immigration enforcement. Democrats, including Senators Chris Van Hollen and Elizabeth Warren, condemned Garcia's detention and the proposed deportation to Uganda as unjust and a weaponization of government.</p>

Musk's firms allege that ChatGPT benefits from exclusive access to user prompts and that Apple deprioritizes rival AI apps in its App Store.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to punish individuals who burn the American flag, accusing them of hostility towards the United States and suggesting one-year prison sentences for convictions. The order directs the Justice Department to prosecute flag desecration under "content-neutral laws" that cause harm unrelated to expression, while acknowledging the Supreme Court's 1989 ruling that flag burning is protected speech. Legal experts argue the president cannot unilaterally change the First Amendment, which has consistently upheld flag burning as expressive conduct.

          <p>Several European postal carriers, including those from Germany, Spain, and France, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the U.S. as they grapple with the end of the "de minimis" trade exemption. President Trump's executive order, effective Friday, eliminates the rule allowing goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Carriers cite system unpreparedness for new customs requirements, particularly concerning duty collection and data transmission.
