          <p>Sean Dickson guided Somerset to a dramatic quarter-final victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast tournament with a remarkable late-game performance. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson struck two sixes and a four to secure the win with just one ball to spare, finishing with an unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls. This thrilling conclusion overturned what seemed like a certain defeat, sending Somerset to a record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day and continuing the Bears' streak of last-eight losses.</p>

          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer, with hiding an 18th-century painting looted during World War II. The artwork, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was discovered after 80 years when Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing for Kadgien's home. The heir of the original Jewish Dutch owner has filed a legal claim to reclaim the painting, which is part of a broader effort to recover over a thousand works of art lost during the war.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in central London against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in more than 425 arrests. The majority were detained for showing support for the organization, which was banned under the Terrorism Act in July, making such displays a criminal offense. The Metropolitan Police reported significant abuse towards officers, while protest organizers and Amnesty International criticized the police response as heavy-handed and an infringement on the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago has elicited sharply divided reactions from the city's residents. In neighborhoods with high crime rates, some welcome the potential for increased security, while community organizers and other residents argue that local violence prevention programs are already effective and that a military presence is not the answer. The plan has also heightened anxiety in the city's large Latino communities, where many fear the troops could be used for widespread immigration raids.</p>

          <p>This article serves as a buyer's guide for several older Lexus models that are appreciating in value due to their exceptional reliability and enduring luxury. Models such as the 1993 LS 400, 1997 LX 450, and 2009 GX 470 are highlighted as sought-after vehicles in the used car market. The brand's reputation for long-lasting engines and high-quality construction means these older cars can offer significant value, but their growing popularity suggests prices may soon rise, making now a good time for enthusiasts to purchase them.

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has publicly stated that President Trump should "absolutely" fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams described Kennedy's recent policies on vaccines and his shake-up of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as "dangerous" and a threat to the nation's health. His comments echo growing criticism from the medical community and some lawmakers who are concerned that Kennedy's actions are undermining public trust in science and medicine.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their place in the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive test matches. Despite the lopsided final score, England delivered a shaky and undisciplined performance in the first half, trailing early before finding their rhythm. The win was also marred by injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman, giving future opponents hope against the tournament favorites.</p>
