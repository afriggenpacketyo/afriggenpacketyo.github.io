          <p>This opinion article contends that the recently declassified annex to the Durham Report highlights the FBI's failure to investigate 2016 intelligence suggesting a Clinton campaign plan to link Donald Trump to Russia. The author argues that media outlets have focused on the authenticity of specific memos while ignoring the core issue: the intelligence accurately predicted the political strategy that unfolded. The piece asserts that unlike the FBI's inaction on this front, Special Counsel John Durham conducted a thorough investigation, interviewing key figures and corroborating parts of the intelligence. This disparity in investigative rigor is presented as the central revelation of the annex, suggesting a deliberate effort by federal agencies to ignore information that contradicted the prevailing narrative.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born into slavery, will finally receive a headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Known as "Bruce Grit," he founded several newspapers and was a leading voice in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but died without the funds for a proper grave marker in 1924. A century later, a coalition of private and public donors, organized by the urban think tank RiseUp, has funded a black granite headstone to honor his legacy. The effort aims to rectify a historical oversight and celebrate a figure who dedicated his life to preserving and acknowledging Black history and culture.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas to prevent the Republican-led legislature from achieving a quorum needed to vote on a controversial redistricting plan. The proposed map, encouraged by former President Trump, could create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts. The Democrats, now in states like Illinois, say they are prepared to stay away for the remainder of the special session, despite threats of arrest from Governor Greg Abbott. They argue they are protecting representative democracy from an egregious gerrymander, while Republicans accuse them of abandoning their duties and holding disaster relief funding hostage. The lawmakers state they are willing to face any consequences for their actions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean 'Diddy' Combs' request for release on bail, ordering him to remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing on October 3. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking. The judge was not convinced by arguments that Combs was not a flight risk or that he faced significant danger in the facility, noting that staff had so far kept him safe. The decision came despite a letter of support from a woman identified as a victim in the trial, who believed Combs was making efforts to change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appellate court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop summarily deporting migrants under a sweeping asylum ban instituted by the Trump administration. The policy had allowed for the rapid removal of individuals entering the country illegally without an opportunity to claim asylum. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore other laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face torture or persecution. This effectively reopens humanitarian protection screenings, though officials will likely process migrants under expedited removal, which still allows for asylum claims, and continue to limit releases into the U.S. interior.</p>

          <p>Joshua Taylor, a Michigan resident living with a genetic condition that causes incontinence, is leading a campaign to make adult changing tables a standard feature in public spaces. Taylor highlights that teenagers and adults with disabilities often face the indignity of being changed on restroom floors or in cars, or are forced to stay home to avoid such situations. He argues that these facilities are a necessary accommodation, not a mere convenience, for millions of people. Working with the national organization Changing Spaces USA and local officials, Taylor is successfully advocating for the installation of these tables to improve accessibility and allow individuals with disabilities to participate more fully in community life.</p>

          <p>As Texas Democrats remain out of state to block a redistricting vote, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove them from office, citing a nonbinding attorney general opinion. However, legal and political experts suggest his options are extremely limited, as Texas law primarily allows for removal through a two-thirds expulsion vote by the legislature or at the ballot box. While the Republican-led House has issued civil arrest warrants, these are unenforceable outside of Texas. Governor Abbott has also suggested bribery charges could be pursued, but experts believe this is unlikely to succeed under the state's loose ethics laws, framing the threats as political pressure rather than viable legal action.</p>

As of mid-July, over 220,000 acres have burned statewide, nearly double the five-year average for this point in the year. The surge is driven by large fires like the 65,000-acre Gifford fire, fueled by exceptionally dry vegetation and heat waves. While Northern California has had a slower start, officials warn that a coming heat wave could elevate fire risk across the entire state, potentially causing "abnormally elevated fire behavior" and unpredictable, plume-dominated fires.</p>

          <p>Following the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner over a large downward revision to jobs numbers, experts are clarifying that such revisions are a standard and essential part of the reporting process. Former BLS officials and labor economists explain that initial reports are estimates based on data received by a deadline. Revisions in subsequent months incorporate late responses from surveyed businesses and households, providing a more accurate picture over time. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision was large, they stress it is not evidence of manipulation but a reflection of the challenge of timely data collection, especially with declining survey response rates.</p>

          <p>In an interview following the sentencing of Bryan Kohberger, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson discussed the decision to accept a plea deal that spared Kohberger the death penalty. Thompson stated that securing guilty pleas and a waiver of appeals provided finality for the victims' families and the community, which was the primary goal. He addressed criticism for not requiring a full confession as part of the deal, explaining his belief that Kohberger would only offer self-serving statements that would further victimize the families. Thompson described the crimes as incomprehensibly evil and noted that even FBI profilers believed the killer's true motive might never be understood by ordinary people.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of weakness in July, with employers hiring fewer people than expected and the government sharply revising down job growth for the previous two months. Economists suggest this stagnation is driven by uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade and tariff policies, causing many businesses to delay hiring and investment. While sectors like healthcare added jobs, manufacturing saw losses, and many other areas showed no growth. The data indicates a challenging environment for job seekers, as companies hesitate to expand their payrolls, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that some experts believe could worsen if tariff-related uncertainty persists.

Erivo's portrayal of Jesus as a queer Black woman was described as divine and modern, while Lambert's Judas was a thrilling, rock-styled foil.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to counter a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas by preparing a retaliatory measure. State Democrats will craft a bill to redraw California's own congressional maps, but it will include a "trigger" so that it only goes before voters if Texas moves forward with its plan to add five GOP seats. The move sets up a high-stakes political showdown that could influence control of the U.S. House.

The violation occurred when allies broadcast a live call from Bolsonaro at a rally where he repeated claims of election fraud. Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly leading a coup attempt after his 2022 election loss.

An estimated 20% of the initial victims were Koreans, many of whom were in Japan as forced laborers under colonial rule. Survivors like Shim Jin-tae and Lee Jung-soon, now living in Hapcheon, South Korea, describe a lifetime of illness, disfigurement, and social stigma. They feel abandoned by all parties—the U.S., Japan, and their own government in South Korea—as they fight for recognition and support for multi-generational health problems they believe are linked to radiation exposure.

Opponents argue this move will rob veterans of the freedom to control their own bodies, particularly impacting the more than half of female veterans who live in states where abortion is already banned or heavily restricted.
