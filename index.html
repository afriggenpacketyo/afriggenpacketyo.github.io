          <p>Sean Combs, also known as Puffy, Diddy, or Love, faces a significant legal challenge with a sex trafficking trial set to begin next month, adding to a three-decade-long history of allegations of violence and misconduct. The article recounts incidents from a 1991 charity basketball game stampede to more recent charges of running a criminal enterprise that coerced women into sexual acts. Combs denies the accusations, asserting the relationships were consensual, but the trial and over 50 civil suits threaten to tarnish his image as a successful music mogul. The New York Times article details Combs' rise to fame, his influence on hip-hop culture, and the various controversies that have marked his career, painting a picture of a man whose charmed life is now under serious scrutiny.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has attributed recent economic challenges, including stock market performance, to President Biden's policies, despite data indicating that the current economic climate is a result of his own administration's actions, particularly the implementation of tariffs. The article notes that the first three months of Trump's second term have been defined by sweeping changes to the federal government and the imposition of tariffs against U.S. trade partners. Trump maintains that his tariffs will stimulate domestic production and boost the U.S. economy, although economists express concerns about potential disruptions and negative impacts on consumer spending.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is impacting the golf cart industry, highlighting the complexities of global supply chains even for products assembled in the United States. While companies like Club Car and E-Z-Go assemble their golf carts in the U.S., they source components from various countries, including China, Taiwan, and Europe, making them vulnerable to tariffs. The article details the specific components sourced from different countries and notes that the ITC is considering tariffs on Chinese-made golf carts, which could benefit domestic players but also force them to raise prices or sacrifice profit margins. The article also notes that First Solar said Trump's tariffs create a significant economic headwind for its plants in India, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of failing to deliver on its promise to establish five local inquiries into grooming gangs, alleging that only one inquiry has been set up despite pledges of funding. The Conservative leader criticized Sir Keir Starmer, suggesting he was shielding Labour-run councils from scrutiny. This accusation comes amidst growing demands for transparency regarding grooming gang inquiries and a heated exchange in Parliament, with Badenoch linking the issue to upcoming local elections. The article also mentions the Conservative's call for a national inquiry into grooming gangs and Baroness Hazarika's apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the actions of these gangs.</p>

          <p>Experts are weighing the risks and benefits of Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) in the current economic environment, noting that while they offer lower interest rates than credit cards, the variable nature of HELOC rates can create financial risks. While HELOCs can be useful for homeowners with stable incomes and clear purposes for borrowing, such as home improvements or debt consolidation, they may not be suitable for those with unstable income or a tight budget. Experts suggest considering alternative home equity borrowing options like home equity loans or cash-out refinance loans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a sharp slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate, according to the Commerce Department. The contraction is attributed to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies, with economists cautioning that the figures may be skewed due to the surge in imports. Concerns about the tariffs have led to changes in business and consumer behavior, signaling potential headwinds for the economy in the coming months. The report also notes a decline in government spending and a miss on ADP employment numbers, raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that GLP-1 drugs, used for diabetes and weight loss, can lead to reduced medical costs for employers within two years due to improved health outcomes for patients. Aon researchers analyzed medical claims data for 139,000 U.S.-based workers and found that patients taking GLP-1 medications experienced a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events and the onset of diabetes. This reduction in health issues led to a slowing of the medical cost trend, suggesting that the pricey medications can pay off by improving worker health and lowering overall health costs over time.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S. since the start of President Trump's second term, coinciding with the implementation of new tariffs. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Chobani are investing billions of dollars in building and expanding U.S. factories, although not all directly cite tariffs as the primary motivation. While the White House touts these moves as supporting job creation, economists remain skeptical that tariffs alone are sufficient to drive such strategic pivots, noting that factors like labor costs and the regulatory environment also play a significant role.</p>

          <p>The NFL has fined the Atlanta Falcons and their defensive coordinator, Jeff Ulbrich, for a prank call made to Shedeur Sanders during the NFL Draft. Ulbrich's son, Jax, admitted to making the call, posing as a New Orleans Saints general manager, after obtaining Sanders's number from his father's iPad. The league fined Ulbrich $100,000 and the Falcons $250,000 for failing to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, but Sanders downplayed the incident, stating that it did not have a significant impact on him.</p>

          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop after the social media company withheld its second-quarter guidance, citing concerns about the uncertain macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on advertising demand. The company's finance chief noted that some advertisers are already seeing an impact from changes to the de minimis exemption, while fears of a weakening economy have fueled concerns that companies could reduce advertising spending. Despite a 9% year-over-year increase in ad revenues during the quarter, Snap's decision to withhold guidance reflects the challenging economic climate and the potential for further disruptions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown at the beginning of 2025 due to the chaotic implementation of President Trump's tariffs, leading to a decline in gross domestic product.
