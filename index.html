            <h2>Trump Administration to End Protected Status for Afghan Nationals</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 21:37:33 EDT</div>

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation. This decision reverses the Biden administration's earlier extensions of TPS, which were based on the dangerous conditions in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Critics argue that conditions in Afghanistan have not improved and that ending TPS would undermine America's commitment to its allies, especially those who worked with the U.S. government during the war. Advocates for Afghan refugees express concern about the uncertainty this decision creates for individuals who have built lives in the U.S.</p>

            <p>President Trump asserted that he "got every answer right" on a cognitive test during his annual physical exam, but he did not release detailed medical information. This follows a pattern of limited transparency regarding his health, especially compared to his criticism of his predecessor, Joe Biden. The public has not had a detailed look into Trump's health since 2018, despite promises to provide updates during the 2024 campaign. The White House press secretary stated that the president's physician would provide an update on the report in the interest of transparency.</p>

            <p>Bella Thorne has accused Mickey Rourke of misconduct during the filming of "Girl" in 2020, alleging that he used a metal grinder on her genitals through her jeans instead of her kneecap. Thorne claims she sustained bruises and felt humiliated by Rourke's behavior, including revving his engine to cover her in dirt. Rourke's representatives stated that he denies any intentional misconduct and was unaware of any discomfort expressed by Thorne at the time, offering to cooperate with any inquiry.

            <p>Experts are warning that a prolonged trade war between the U.S. and China could have devastating consequences for African economies. The U.S. tariff policy could deal a blow to African exports, particularly impacting resource-rich countries like South Africa and those with clothing manufacturing industries benefiting from the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). While Trump announced a pause on "reciprocal tariffs" for most countries, the increased tariffs on China could indirectly harm Africa if China's economy stumbles, given the continent's reliance on trade with China.</p>

            <p>A small plane crashed near I-95 in Boca Raton, Florida, killing all three people on board and injuring one person on the ground. The Cessna 310, en route to Tallahassee, crashed onto the Tri-Rail tracks, causing significant disruptions to train traffic and road closures. Aviation experts suggest the plane may have experienced trouble shortly after takeoff and attempted to return to the airport before crashing. Witnesses reported seeing the plane flying low and then a large explosion, leaving debris scattered across the area.</p>

            <p>President Trump underwent his annual medical examination, prompting anticipation for details about his health. Despite questioning his predecessor's fitness, Trump has maintained secrecy around his own health information.

The examination follows an assassination attempt against Trump in July, after which only a memo describing a gunshot wound to his ear was released. Trump's health has been a topic of discussion, especially given his age, making him the oldest president to be sworn into office.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was detained last month, with the government citing a Cold War-era immigration law that allows deportation if a person's presence is deemed adverse to American foreign policy interests. The ACLU criticized the decision, stating it was based solely on Khalil's speech, while the Trump administration claims the deportation is to protect Jewish students from harassment. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal the decision.</p>

The execution is part of a series of executions in South Carolina after a 13-year pause, driven by difficulties in obtaining lethal injection drugs.

            <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" Garcia's return, acknowledging that Judge Paula Xinis may have exceeded her authority. Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error," though the administration alleges he is a member of MS-13, which his lawyer denies.

            <p>Following the successful resurrection of dire wolf puppies, the Trump administration is reconsidering the Endangered Species Act. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum expressed enthusiasm for "de-extinction" technology and its potential to strengthen biodiversity protection efforts. Burgum suggested that the only thing that should "go extinct" is the need for an endangered species list, emphasizing innovation over regulation. This shift in perspective could lead to changes in how the U.S. protects and manages endangered species.</p>

            <p>Australia's iconic gumtrees are facing an increasing threat from climate change, with a quarter of eucalypt species at risk of extinction. Droughts, heatwaves, and bushfires, fueled by climate change, are pushing these historically hardy trees to their limits. Many eucalypt species have small distributions and are highly adapted to specific areas, making them particularly vulnerable to localized climate impacts. The story highlights the broader impact of climate change on Australia's unique ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Analysts suggest that the record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could serve as a stress test for China's ability to withstand Western economic pressure in a potential Taiwan Strait crisis. If China weathers the tariffs, it could boost Beijing's confidence in facing future sanctions. However, decisions regarding Taiwan remain complex political and military considerations for Beijing. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports, signaling a strong stance against any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has authorized the U.S. military to take jurisdiction over federal lands along the southern border to enforce his immigration agenda. The order directs the transfer of jurisdiction over federal land to the Department of Defense, designating the areas as "National Defense Areas." The move is intended to address what Trump calls an "invasion" at the border, despite a dramatic drop in illegal border crossings in recent months. Critics argue that the military's increased role could lead to more severe charges for migrants and raise concerns about the militarization of the border.</p>
