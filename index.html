            <p>A recent poll by the NASUWT teaching union in the UK indicates that social media influencers, particularly controversial figures like Andrew Tate, are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism in schools. Teachers reported instances of students, even as young as 10, expressing sexist views influenced by these online personalities. The Department for Education (DfE) acknowledges the damaging impact of such influencers and is working to support teachers in addressing this issue. The union plans to debate motions at its annual conference regarding the shift of far-right and populist recruitment to social media platforms. </p>

            <p>The ACLU is seeking emergency intervention from the Supreme Court to temporarily halt the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law. These detainees, transferred to a detention facility in Texas, are allegedly being deported to El Salvador, where some have already been sent to a mega-prison. The ACLU argues that these removals violate due process, as the detainees are not given adequate opportunity to challenge their cases before deportation. This legal battle tests the limits of the President's deportation plans and powers, especially in light of previous Supreme Court rulings requiring proper notice and due process.</p>

Despite not being convicted of any crime, the White House claims he is a member of the gang, citing a 2019 detention where police identified him as an MS-13 member based on his clothing and a confidential source. However, his lawyers argue that the alleged gang clique is based in New York, where he has never lived, and that he was granted a "withholding of removal" order due to fear of persecution by a rival gang. The case highlights the complexities of immigration policy and the challenges of verifying gang affiliations.</p>

This unusual behavior, where investors are not flocking to US bonds as a safe haven, suggests a loss of confidence in the US economy. Higher bond yields can lead to increased borrowing costs for the government, businesses, and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth.

            <h2>Supreme Court Ruling on Definition of "Woman" Sparks Debate</h2>

            <p>A Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" as a biological woman has ignited contrasting reactions, with some praising it as "common sense" and others condemning it as "devastating." The ruling provides clarity for the Equality Act, stating that single-sex spaces should be reserved for biological women. While some women's groups celebrate the ruling, trans rights advocates express concerns about exclusion and increased harassment. The EHRC is updating its guidance to reflect the ruling, and organizations are grappling with the practical implications of the decision.</p>

            <p>Artists and creatives are protesting against the growing trend of using AI to generate images, particularly the "starter pack" images of people as toys. They argue that this trend devalues creativity and threatens their livelihoods. The #StarterPackNoAI movement has gained traction on social media, with artists showcasing their handmade creations as a counterpoint to AI-generated content. Artists also express concerns about intellectual property rights and the potential for AI to reduce opportunities for human artists.</p>

            <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that the U.S. may cease its efforts to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine if there is no progress in the coming days.

Rubio's comments came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.</p>
