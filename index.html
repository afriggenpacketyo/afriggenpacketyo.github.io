        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US President Donald Trump has declared his intent to impose additional 100% tariffs on imports from China starting next month, alongside new export controls on critical software. This move follows China's decision to tighten rules for rare earth exports, which Trump described as "very hostile." Financial markets reacted negatively, with the S&P 500 experiencing its steepest fall since April. Experts suggest China's actions aim to gain leverage in upcoming trade talks, highlighting the ongoing tension in the US-China trade relationship. The situation underscores the complex interplay of economic policy and geopolitical strategy between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>During a Maine school board meeting in Augusta, two women undressed to protest state policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports and use their locker rooms. This act occurred as a local parent condemned the board for enforcing these policies, arguing it creates discomfort for young girls. Similar protests have taken place in California, reflecting a growing national trend. The U.S. Department of Justice is suing both states over these policies, while some local school districts are adopting resolutions to oppose state guidelines. Public opinion in Maine appears divided, with a majority supporting sports participation based on biological sex.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a lawsuit against Southern California Edison (SCE), claiming its equipment ignited the 2019 Saddle Ridge fire, which devastated nearly 9,000 acres and over 100 homes. The complaint alleges negligence in the design, construction, and maintenance of SCE's high-voltage transmission line in Sylmar, also linking it to the more recent Hurst fire. SCE has denied responsibility for the 2019 blaze in a separate lawsuit by victims, despite acknowledging its equipment may have caused the Jan. 7 fire. The federal government seeks recovery costs for national forest damage and fire suppression efforts, highlighting ongoing concerns about utility infrastructure and wildfire risk.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems, a military explosives plant in Tennessee, has left 19 people missing and multiple fatalities. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis described the scene as one of the most devastating in his career, stating the affected building was "gone." Four or five individuals were hospitalized, though exact numbers are unconfirmed. The cause remains unknown, with federal agencies like the FBI and ATF on site for an investigation expected to last days. The company, which produces explosives for military and commercial markets, was cited by OSHA in 2019 for safety violations, adding a layer of scrutiny to the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly in advanced discussions to acquire key talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI. Prompt AI, an 11-person company, informed employees of the pending transaction, with those not joining Apple offered reduced salaries. The startup, founded in 2023, had raised $5 million but struggled with its business model, leading to the retirement of its Seemour app. Apple, known for smaller, strategic acquisitions, likely seeks to integrate Prompt's sophisticated camera detection capabilities into its HomeKit smart home division. This move aligns with Apple's efforts to bolster its AI capabilities, particularly in computer vision, despite past criticisms of its overall AI progress.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown extends into its second week, Senate Democrats are holding firm against President Trump's pressure tactics, expressing confidence in their position. They insist on extending health-insurance subsidies before agreeing to reopen the government, a stance that has surprised and pleased House Democrats. Despite Trump's administration initiating federal worker layoffs and threatening to cut funding for Democratic-leaning states, Republicans are showing signs of internal strain. The political impasse has elevated health care as a central issue, with some Republicans and even Trump himself now acknowledging the electoral impact of rising health-care costs. The resolution remains uncertain as both sides dig in.</p>

          <p>The latest installment in the Disney franchise, 'Tron: Ares,' is reviewed as visually stunning but narratively perplexing, continuing a pattern seen in its predecessors. The article notes the film's attempt to update its techno-futuristic world, with sentient computer programs now unleashed into metropolitan streets, seemingly responding to contemporary AI discussions. However, the review criticizes the screenplay for its 'rock-brained' internal logic and superficial engagement with AI's potential, prioritizing glossy aesthetics over conceptual depth. Despite thrilling action sequences and a Nine Inch Nails score, the film's protagonist, played by Jared Leto, is described as a 'charisma vacuum,' hindering the emotional core of the story.</p>

Judge Paula Xinis expressed frustration with the administration's lack of progress in removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, his preferred destination, which has indicated willingness to accept him. The administration has explored options like Eswatini and Ghana, but faces rejections and has not assessed safety concerns. Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue his continued detention is illegal, suggesting the government's aim is punitive rather than lawful removal.

          <p>Wendy Osefo, a star of ‘Real Housewives of Potomac,’ and her husband, Eddie Osefo, have been arrested on multiple fraud charges related to an alleged staged burglary and theft. A Carroll County grand jury indicted the couple for fraudulently reporting a burglary at their Finksburg home last year, claiming over $200,000 worth of jewelry and luxury goods were stolen while they were on vacation. Detectives discovered the Osefos had returned some 'stolen' items and that Wendy was seen wearing a ring she claimed was missing. Prosecutors allege the couple fabricated the incident to defraud their insurance company, seeking $450,000 in claims.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what the White House described as a "routine yearly checkup," six months after his last annual physical. The White House did not explain the reason for the second checkup, though Trump is considering a trip to the Middle East soon. The president stated he feels to be in "great shape" both physically and mentally. His previous physical in April reported no abnormalities, aside from minor sun damage and scarring from a 2024 assassination attempt, though a later readout revealed chronic venous insufficiency. Presidents typically visit Walter Reed for extensive medical examinations.</p>

          <p>A Chicago woman, Marimar Martinez, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon after being shot multiple times by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. Prosecutors allege Martinez rammed a federal vehicle and was armed, prompting agents to fire in self-defense. However, Martinez's lawyer, Christopher Parente, claims body-worn camera footage contradicts this account, showing an officer saying, "Do something, bitch," before shooting. The incident occurred amidst heightened immigration enforcement in Chicago by the Trump administration, raising questions about agent conduct and the use of force.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Dismiss Mortgage Fraud Case Against New York AG Letitia James as 'Bupkis'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 16:31:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are highly skeptical of the mortgage fraud charges brought against New York Attorney General Letitia James, with some calling the case "bupkis." Career prosecutors previously found no probable cause, but a Trump-appointed interim US attorney proceeded with the indictment. James is accused of bank fraud for allegedly misrepresenting a second home as her primary residence to secure a better mortgage rate, saving her about $18,933. However, experts argue the mortgage rider does not explicitly prohibit rentals and includes exemptions for "extenuating circumstances" like the Covid-19 pandemic. The politically charged nature of the case, coupled with the low alleged financial benefit, strengthens James's claim of selective prosecution.</p>
