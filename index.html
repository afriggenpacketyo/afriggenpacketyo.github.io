          <p>Senate Democrats have requested that the Government Accountability Office investigate FBI Director Kash Patel's use of government aircraft for personal travel. The inquiry follows reports that Patel has used FBI jets for trips to visit his girlfriend and attend sporting events. Executive branch policy requires FBI directors to use government aircraft for all air travel but to reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. The GAO's review will examine Patel's flight records, bureau spending, and whether Patel reimbursed the government for personal trips, echoing concerns raised about his predecessor's travel habits.</p>

          <p>New York City has ended its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which since 1997, purchased over 1,800 properties to protect the city's drinking water supply. The city spent $518 million to acquire 156,350 acres to keep waste out of the watersheds, allowing the city to avoid filtration. The decision to halt the program came after an independent review concluded further land purchases would be of little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring Catskill townships to approve any land transactions.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that American girls "could be very happy" with fewer dolls due to new tariffs, sparking criticism for seeming out of touch. He said children don't need excessive amounts of toys and can manage with fewer items. This follows Trump's acknowledgement that tariffs may lead to emptier shelves, but he insists China will struggle more. Critics like Sen. Bernie Sanders have condemned the comments as showing a lack of understanding of working-class families' struggles.</p>

It also imposes a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100m annually.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world. This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad. Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on. But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.</p>
