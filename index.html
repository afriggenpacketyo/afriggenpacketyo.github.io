          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were previously let go. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the department's critical functions and obligations mandated by Congress, noting that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of twelve offices responsible for enforcing civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination. The judge also pointed out that the entire team supervising the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was eliminated. This action follows a lawsuit filed by 21 states against the Trump administration over the staff reductions, underscoring concerns about the agency's ability to fulfill its duties. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant drop after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. Residential solar installer Sunrun plummeted by more than 35% because the legislation ends tax credits for installers who lease equipment to customers. Analysts at Jefferies described the GOP bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, with Guggenheim analysts noting the disastrous impact on companies like Sunrun, as lease arrangements are used by about 70% of the rooftop solar industry. The bill also ends investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, but manufacturing tax credits remain relatively untouched, which is good news for First Solar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, estimating between 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 strengthening into hurricanes and 3 to 5 becoming major hurricanes. Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham emphasized technological advancements allowing for more accurate forecasts. The forecast considers the neutral condition of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation cycle and the influence of warmer waters due to climate change. NOAA's forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead, with potential updates later in the season.</p>

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, with 431,000 more people arriving than leaving. This decrease was primarily driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK, following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. The drop was also influenced by large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving the country. The Home Office also reported a decrease in the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels, although the figure remains higher than when Labour came to power.</p>

California leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have vowed to challenge the Senate vote and restore the ban, citing its importance for reducing smog and maintaining the state's environmental leadership.

The ruling referenced Trump's previous calls to shut down the department and argued that the reduction in force was a means of achieving this goal without congressional consent. This decision follows a similar ruling where another federal judge blocked the administration from firing members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new missile defense project called the "Golden Dome for America," aimed at protecting the U.S. from foreign missile threats. The multilayered system would involve space-based sensors and interceptors and could cost hundreds of billions of dollars. It would include detecting and destroying missiles ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse, and stopping them in the final moments of approach. China has criticized the plan as a potential militarization of space and a catalyst for a global arms race.</p>

Over half of the NSF research grants terminated since April fund STEM education programs, totaling a loss of $773 million. Canceled projects include initiatives aimed at engaging high school students with autism in engineering and creating hands-on programs for Indigenous youth.

          <p>A small jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego early Thursday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities among those on board and the destruction of several homes. The aircraft, a Cessna 550, crashed in Murphy Canyon near the Tierrasanta neighborhood, causing multiple homes to catch fire. Residents were quickly evacuated, and there were no reports of serious injuries among people on the ground. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted to revoke Californiaâ€™s vehicle emission standards that would have effectively banned the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035. The 51-44 vote overturned a Biden-era waiver that enabled California and other states to enforce zero-emission requirements. Republican senators argued that Californiaâ€™s requirements threatened the American auto industry, while Democrats warned of serious health effects. The vote proceeded despite warnings from the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian that the waivers could not be overturned with the Congressional Review Act.</p>

          <p>The House has approved a bill that includes a stricter requirement for Medicaid recipients to provide proof of employment as a condition of receiving health insurance. This policy, which Republicans have sought for a decade, would require childless adults without disabilities to prove they worked, volunteered, or attended school for 80 hours in the month before enrollment. Experts estimate this could leave millions uninsured, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that these changes would cause 7.6 million people to become uninsured. The legislation still needs to pass the Senate, where its future is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in April declined 0.5% from March, reaching the slowest April pace since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. High interest rates and low consumer confidence continue to hinder the spring housing market. Inventory jumped 9% month to month, with 1.45 million homes for sale at the end of April, representing a 4.4-month supply, the highest level in five years. The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, an increase of just 1.8% year over year.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue manufacturing the penny, citing that it costs more to produce than its actual value. The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out in early 2026. The move is expected to save the Mint approximately $56 million annually. The Trump administration had signaled its intent to stop making the 1-cent coin due to rising production costs.</p>

The company's new facility is part of a joint venture with the software giant Oracle, the chipmaker Nvidia, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and G42, an Emirati artificial intelligence firm. G42 is also expected to contribute money to the construction of OpenAI data centers in the United States. The complex arrangement overlaps with a separate agreement reached last week between the United States and the United Arab Emirates to build an A.I. campus in Abu Dhabi powered by five gigawatts of electrical power.</p>
