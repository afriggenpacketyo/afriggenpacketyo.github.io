          <p>The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, citing the country's continued purchases of Russian oil. This raises the total tariff rate on Indian goods to 50%, one of the highest US levies. The new rate is set to take effect in 21 days, escalating trade tensions amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. India's foreign ministry has condemned the move as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," vowing to take necessary actions to protect its national interests.</p>

          <p>The new 25% tariff on India is the latest move in a broader trade strategy by the Trump administration, as detailed in this article's timeline.

          <p>The city of San Diego is set to dramatically increase the cost of street parking around Petco Park during games and other special events. Starting September 1, hourly meter rates in the designated zone will quadruple from $2.50 to $10 for a six-hour period, making the cost comparable to parking at Dodger Stadium. This move, part of a city-wide effort to generate more revenue, has been met with objections from the San Diego Padres, who were surprised by the action and its potential impact on fans.</p>

          <h2>Experts Predict Housing Affordability for Fall 2025 Hinges on Mortgage Rate Stability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 11:11:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to lending experts, the key factor for housing affordability this fall will be the stability of mortgage rates rather than a significant drop. While rates are expected to remain relatively steady, this predictability could help both buyers and sellers make plans with more confidence. National housing inventory is on the rise, which may help moderate prices, but affordability remains a major challenge. The market is highly specific to location, with some areas experiencing bidding wars while others see more balanced conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of server manufacturer Super Micro Computer plunged by 20% after the company released fiscal fourth-quarter results and a future outlook that both fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company's performance was negatively impacted by U.S. tariffs, a shortfall in working capital, and design changes requested by a major customer. This disappointing report marks a significant slowdown for a company that had previously experienced a massive surge in growth driven by high demand for AI servers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to place Washington D.C. under direct federal control, potentially revoking its long-standing "home rule" charter. The threat came in response to an alleged assault on a former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), with Trump citing what he called "out of control" crime in the city. This proposal to strip the capital of its elected local government has ignited a political firestorm and raised significant constitutional questions about the federal district's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Marking 80 years since the world's first atomic bombing, Hiroshima held a solemn commemoration ceremony at its Peace Park. Elderly survivors, known as hibakusha, shared their harrowing experiences and repeated their urgent message that "nuclear weapons and humanity cannot co-exist." With fewer than 100,000 survivors remaining, there is a deep concern that their stories will fade, alongside hope that younger generations will continue the mission for a world free of nuclear weapons. Japan's prime minister also spoke, reaffirming the nation's commitment to this goal.</p>

          <p>In a significant move, the Tennessee attorney general's office has subpoenaed four medical groups for several years of abortion-related records. This action is part of the state's defense in a lawsuit challenging the clarity and application of the medical exceptions in its near-total abortion ban. The sweeping request for documents and communications has alarmed reproductive rights advocates, who fear it will create a chilling effect on doctors and represents a new front in government efforts to track abortion providers post-Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <h2>Study Estimates Los Angeles Wildfires Caused Hundreds of Additional Deaths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 11:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the medical journal JAMA suggests that the official death toll from the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year is a significant undercount. Researchers estimate the disaster led to approximately 440 additional deaths beyond the official count of 31. These excess fatalities are likely due to indirect factors such as exacerbated heart and lung conditions from poor air quality and disruptions in access to necessary healthcare. The findings highlight the hidden mortality burden of climate-related emergencies.</p>
