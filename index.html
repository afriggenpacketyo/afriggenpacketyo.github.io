          <p>FedEx announced fiscal first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise over 5% in after-hours trading. The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.83 per share on revenue of $22.24 billion, beating analyst forecasts. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's resilience amid global trade volatility, noting improvements from higher domestic package volumes. The company is also navigating headwinds from the elimination of the "de minimis" tax exception for small shipments and is proceeding with its plan to spin off FedEx Freight.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed optimism about passing a 52-day continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown, with a vote scheduled for Friday morning. The short-term funding measure is designed to give appropriators more time to finalize spending bills, but it faces opposition from Democrats. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has stated his party will not support the bill, citing Republican efforts to cut healthcare funding. With a slim majority, Speaker Johnson can only afford to lose two Republican votes, making passage uncertain despite an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The helicopter carrying President Donald Trump, known as Marine One, was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Luton Airport due to a minor hydraulic issue during his state visit to the UK. The White House confirmed the diversion was made out of an abundance of caution, and the president and first lady were safely transferred to a support helicopter to continue their journey to Stansted Airport. The incident occurred as Trump concluded a multi-day visit that included meetings with King Charles and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Emergency services were present at Luton, but the situation was resolved without further incident.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is introducing new safety measures for ChatGPT to address concerns about the AI chatbot's impact on teenagers, following a Senate subcommittee hearing where parents blamed the technology for contributing to youth mental health crises. CEO Sam Altman announced plans for an "age-prediction system" to identify users under 18 and implement stricter content filters, particularly around topics like self-harm. The company will also roll out parental controls, including usage limits, by the end of the month.

          <p>Versant, the new public company being spun off from Comcast to house its NBCUniversal cable networks, has reported declining revenue and profits in a recent SEC filing. The entity, which includes channels like USA, CNBC, and MSNBC, generated $7 billion in revenue last year, down from $7.8 billion in 2022, with net income also falling. This financial downturn reflects the broader industry trend of viewers shifting from traditional cable to streaming services, which has pressured advertising and subscription revenues. The spinoff is intended to isolate the declining cable assets from Comcast's more profitable businesses as Versant prepares to trade on the Nasdaq. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by parent company Disney has ignited widespread public backlash, with critics calling for a boycott of the media giant. The decision followed pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr over Kimmel's monologue addressing the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Advocacy groups argue the move represents state-sanctioned censorship and an attack on First Amendment rights, particularly as media companies like Nexstar and Sinclair face pending FCC business deals. The controversy has mobilized activists who are urging the public to contact the companies and express their opposition to what they see as capitulation to authoritarian pressure.</p>

This has alarmed legal experts, who note that even offensive speech is broadly protected by the First Amendment.

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a shift in economic policy away from traditional Republican pro-market principles towards a form of "state capitalism." This approach combines conventional tax cuts and deregulation with unconventional interventions like tariffs, protectionism, and taking government equity stakes in private companies such as Intel. Analysts note this transactional, deal-based strategy treats the market as a stage for negotiation rather than an efficient allocator of resources. While some see it as a necessary revival of industrial policy, critics argue the erratic and politicized nature of these interventions creates profound uncertainty and encourages corporate lobbying over innovation.

This reopening marks the latest chapter in the trail's troubled history, which includes a devastating wildfire in 2008 that led to a 13-year, $2 million renovation. The short, scenic hike is a major attraction in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, drawing thousands of visitors annually to its 60-foot waterfall. Repair crews have now replaced the damaged bridge section with a stronger, fiber-reinforced polymer to better withstand the region's notoriously fragile environment.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers is warning that President Trump's tariffs are severely harming Asian-American-owned businesses, with some facing the risk of closure due to soaring costs. At a Capitol Hill event, members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus shared constituent stories, such as a family business whose import costs for a single shipment increased from $500 to $13,000 overnight. They argued that these small "mom and pop" stores are being treated as collateral damage in the administration's trade policy. The lawmakers urged the administration to reverse the duties to prevent further economic pain and uncertainty for these communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is projected to face a shortage of nearly 5 million college-educated workers by the year 2032, according to new research from Georgetown University. The study indicates that while almost 14 million young workers with postsecondary education will enter the labor market, this will not be enough to replace over 18 million retiring workers in the same period. Key professions expected to be most affected include management, teaching, nursing, engineering, and accounting. The report suggests that without a massive and immediate increase in educational attainment, 171 different occupations will face significant skills shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arie Perliger, a scholar specializing in political violence, argues that the public fixation on the specific political ideology of Charlie Kirk's assassin is unproductive. He suggests that this focus allows each political side to cherry-pick details that fit their narrative while ignoring the larger environmental factors that facilitate such violence. Perliger's research indicates that political assassinations are often a product of extreme polarization and a loss of faith in a dysfunctional political system. He contends that the current political climate, which incentivizes extremism and delegitimizes opponents, creates a vacuum where individuals may see violence as a viable tool for change.</p>

          <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is urgently seeking to lease hundreds of private office spaces across the country to support a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. According to GSA employees, an "ICE surge" team was created to accommodate the rapid expansion of enforcement officers conducting widespread raids. This push for new facilities comes just months after a White House advisory group initiated significant cuts to GSA staff and federal leases. The effort reflects a government-wide diversion of resources toward immigration enforcement, as ICE aims to hire over 10,000 new officers and increase its detention capacity.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that TV networks providing what he deems to be negative coverage of him should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. The statement, made a day after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's show, escalates concerns about governmental pressure on the media. Trump specifically mentioned that the decision would be up to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who had hours earlier warned ABC's parent company of potential FCC action over Kimmel's monologue. The FCC is an independent agency legally prohibited from censoring broadcast content, but the president's remarks have intensified the debate over free speech and regulatory intimidation.</p>

          <p>The decision by Disney-owned ABC to indefinitely suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" followed direct threats from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, highlighting the leverage the Trump administration holds over media corporations. Carr warned that station owners could face regulatory consequences, prompting major affiliate groups like Nexstar and Sinclair to drop the show before ABC acted. This sequence of events has been condemned by Hollywood unions and free speech advocates as "corporate cowardice" in the face of state censorship. The situation underscores the precarious position of media companies that require FCC approval for mergers and other business deals, creating a chilling effect on critical commentary.</p>
