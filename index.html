          <h2>Study Challenges Beliefs About Healthier Food Choices: Homemade vs. Processed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 07:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in *Food Science* challenges the notion that homemade foods are inherently healthier than their industrially processed counterparts, finding no significant nutritional superiority or fewer harmful compounds in homemade versions of common foods. Experts suggest that both at-home and manufactured foods can contribute to a healthy lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of monitoring nutritional parameters such as sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats regardless of the food's origin. The article highlights that food processing is essentially a larger-scale version of home cooking techniques, often with tighter controls and hygiene standards, but also notes that at-home preparation allows for more control over ingredient quality and selection. Michelle Patidar, a health nutrition coach, supports making food at home with whole ingredients to avoid unwanted additives. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the mass deaths of chicks shipped through the US Postal Service, highlighting a broader issue of animal welfare in the meat industry. A recent incident involving 4,000 chick deaths in Delaware brought attention to the transportation of live animals as commodities, often resulting in significant mortality rates. The author points out that billions of chickens are raised in factory farms, where many die before reaching slaughterhouses due to poor conditions. The piece also sheds light on the lack of federal protections for animals during transportation, leading to millions of deaths annually and argues that the meat industry prioritizes profit over animal welfare. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, amid his administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Since Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth took office, there have been major changes to military academies, including the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and the removal of books related to diversity from academy libraries. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue that these changes undermine the values and education of the academies, while two protests are planned during the ceremony. Trump last spoke at West Point in 2020, where his appearance raised questions about his health. </p>

          <p>A taskforce of experts is working to save Florida's coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient and fast-growing species. The reefs have suffered significant decline due to record ocean heat and climate change, losing 90% of their healthy coral cover in the last 40 years. The project, a collaboration between the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium, aims to restore the reefs and create a habitat for marine life.

          <p>Federal agents are arresting immigrants immediately after their deportation cases are dismissed in court, leading to expedited removal proceedings. This practice, occurring across the country, involves government lawyers dismissing cases only for agents to arrest individuals as they leave the courtroom. Advocates criticize this tactic as a way to speed up deportations, targeting those who followed the rules by entering the U.S. through legal channels. The courthouse arrests have frustrated immigrant rights advocates, who say the rules of the game are changing daily for migrants trying to work within the system. </p>

          <p>The remaking of the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) under President Trump has left civil rights lawsuits as a key defense against alleged civil rights violations, as the DOJ has been restructured. Under Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon, the DOJ's Civil Rights Division has shifted its focus away from protecting minority communities and marginalized people, towards enforcing voter fraud and limiting transgender rights. Attorneys say that without federal oversight, systemic abuse is more likely to run rampant in law enforcement agencies, but California will continue to investigate law enforcement agencies for compliance with civil rights laws. Some worry about the impact on accountability for repeat offenders and delays in cases involving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. </p>

The rise in homelessness, exacerbated by budget cuts, erodes commercial real estate value and public safety.

Assemblymember Matt Haney is leading an initiative in California focused on homelessness response to help people off the streets and into shelters, arguing that this is essential for economic recovery.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues have discovered that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Initially, Haridy sought to understand how vertebrate skeletons first came to be, studying fragments of Anatolepis, an ancient organism thought to be the earliest vertebrate. Upon closer examination, she discovered that Anatolepis was actually an invertebrate, resembling the teeth of vertebrates and suggesting a shared purpose related to sensitivity. This research explains why humans experience toothaches and links the ability to sense pain and temperature to the evolutionary history of teeth. </p>

The strike, ongoing since January, centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with negotiations at a standstill. </p>

Ravec's role is to oversee security for key public figures by assessing risks, and the government successfully argued that Ravec had thought carefully and fairly about what to do.
