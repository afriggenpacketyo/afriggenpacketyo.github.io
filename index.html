            <p>Following a record-setting rally, technology stocks experienced a significant downturn, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 4%. The initial surge was fueled by President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on some tariffs and a reduction to 10% for most countries, but the White House later clarified that the cumulative tariff rate on China would reach 145%. This reversal triggered a market correction, impacting major tech companies like Apple, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, all of which saw substantial declines in their stock values.

            <p>A Senate committee convened to discuss the possibility of establishing a year-round time standard, moving away from the current system of switching between daylight saving time and standard time. While there is broad agreement that the current system needs reform, senators are divided on whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time. The hearing also explored the potential for states to opt out of a national standard, acknowledging the complexities and potential confusion arising from differing time zones. Public opinion is largely in favor of eliminating the twice-yearly time changes due to concerns about health and safety.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to third countries, citing concerns about the lack of due process and potential safety risks for those being removed. The judge expressed misgivings about the policy, suggesting that noncitizens lack a meaningful way to raise concerns about their safety when they are rushed onto deportation flights. The DOJ argued that delaying removals could backlog the courts, while lawyers for the noncitizens described the new policy as inadequate. The judge plans to issue a decision on a preliminary injunction the following week.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's decision to temporarily pause some tariffs, experts caution that the remaining levies, particularly those on China, still pose a significant risk of inflation and recession. The high tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to raise prices for a wide range of consumer products, potentially leading to decreased consumer spending and economic slowdown. Economists point to the potential for businesses to face higher tax costs and for consumers to reduce spending in response to rising prices and economic uncertainty. Some analysts estimate a 60% chance of a recession this year.</p>

            <p>Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, experienced a pullback as investors reduced gains from a recent rally fueled by the U.S. tariff pause announcement. Bitcoin's price decreased by over 3%, reflecting broader market concerns that economic activity could be slowed despite the tariff reprieve. Investors are particularly worried about the higher tariff rate imposed on China. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin has shown resilience and remains near its $80,000 support level.

            <p>The House adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders convinced GOP holdouts to back it. The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans joining all Democrats to vote against it. House conservatives initially resisted the plan but ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings. The budget plan opens the door to implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, and energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.</p>

The surge in Treasury yields created instability in financial markets, prompting Trump to eventually pause some of his tariff plans.

While the stock market initially rallied in response to the policy shift, concerns about market stability remain. (not investment advice)</p>

The company estimates direct losses tied to the fires to be approximately $7.6 billion, although reinsurance will lower its losses to around $612 million.

Even before the global tariffs threats from the Trump administration sent shockwaves through the stock market and economy, the feeling of financial security was slipping further out of reach for Americans across all income levels. Nearly half (48%) of Americans say they are more stressed now than one year ago, with only one in three (32%) citing an improvement in their financial anxiety, and one in five (19%) citing no change. Financial anxiety is the new normal, and unsurprisingly, it is highest among lower-income Americans (less than $50,000 in annual income).</p>

            <p>Two former Torrance police officers pleaded guilty Thursday to charges they spray-painted a swastika inside a car in 2020, a vandalism incident that revealed the officers were part of a larger text thread in which city cops used racist and homophobic slurs and joked about killing Black men. Cody Weldin, 31, and Christopher Tomsic, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of felony vandalism each. They will spend two years on probation and must give up their right to serve as law enforcement officers in California, according to the terms of the plea.</p>
