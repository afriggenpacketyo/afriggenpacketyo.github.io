          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 12:10:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's executive order concerning birthright citizenship. The ruling, which grants a preliminary injunction and certifies the challenge as a class-action lawsuit, follows a recent Supreme Court decision that limited nationwide injunctions but allowed for class-action relief. The judge stated that the petitioners, including pregnant immigrants and their families, would likely suffer irreparable harm if the order was enforced. The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as a significant victory for protecting the constitutional rights of all children born in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has initiated discussions with Nottingham Forest to potentially sign midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White in a deal that could be valued at £60 million. According to sources, the 25-year-old English player has a release clause for this amount, and a move is expected to gain momentum soon. Gibbs-White, who was previously on Manchester City's radar, had a strong season with seven goals and eight assists. The potential transfer comes as Forest is not under financial pressure to sell, having recently agreed to a major transfer for another player.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing negotiations and meetings between U.S. and Israeli leaders, a ceasefire agreement for Gaza has not been reached, with the conflict continuing unabated. Recent Israeli strikes across the territory have resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties. In a particularly tragic incident, a missile strike in Deir al-Balah reportedly killed 15 civilians, including women and children, who were waiting for nutritional aid at a health clinic run by the U.S. charity Project HOPE. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" and expressed regret for any harm to civilians, announcing an investigation into the event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The President cited Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his close professional ties to Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has significant NASA contracts, as reasons for pulling the nomination. Duffy, who will serve in a dual-hatted role, expressed his honor in accepting the position at a critical time for the agency, which is focused on lunar missions and future human exploration of Mars. The move highlights a growing trend of dual appointments within the administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has charged seven Chinese nationals for their alleged involvement in a multi-million dollar marijuana trafficking operation across the Northeast, primarily in Massachusetts and Maine. Authorities arrested six of the individuals, with one remaining at large. The criminal enterprise allegedly smuggled migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border to work in illegal grow houses, withholding their passports until their smuggling debts were repaid. Searches of the properties uncovered large quantities of marijuana, over $470,000 in cash, Chinese passports, and luxury items, including a Rolex watch.</p>

The former official, who helped install the system, noted that over an hour passed before the alert was considered, by which time first responders were already conducting water rescues.

          <p>A new, non-addictive painkiller called Journavx is offering hope for patients with severe pain, but its high cost and restrictive FDA approval are limiting access. The drug, the first new type of painkiller in over two decades, is approved only for short-term acute pain, such as post-surgery, leaving chronic pain sufferers often without insurance coverage. Even for eligible patients, the price is a significant barrier, costing around $15 per pill compared to pennies for generic opioids. While some patients have found temporary relief through manufacturer coupons, the narrow approval and limited insurance adoption mean this potential opioid alternative is out of reach for many.</p>

While Swiss farmers must use pain relief for such procedures, the country still imports products from nations where this is not required.

          <h2>Liberia's Unique History with the U.S. Provides Context for Trump's Remarks on President's English</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 11:42:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent praise of Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English" highlights the deep, historical connections between the United States and the West African nation. Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, often spoken with an American-influenced accent. The country's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. This shared heritage, which includes ten U.S.-born Liberian presidents, explains the cultural and linguistic ties that might have seemed surprising to President Trump but are fundamental to Liberia's identity.</p>

Hundreds of the best seats, including 500 for Centre Court daily, are reserved for those willing to wait in a grassy field near the venue. This has created a vibrant social scene with a festival-like atmosphere, complete with tennis-themed parties, singalongs, and strict etiquette rules enforced by stewards.

CEO Ed Bastian stated that bookings have stabilized after a previous dip, though at lower levels than initially forecast at the start of the year. The airline now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 a share. The positive forecast is driven by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express, indicating a reliance on less price-sensitive travelers and a stabilization in corporate travel demand, which has boosted investor confidence in the sector.

While some affiliates have had to turn away Medicaid patients, others are continuing to provide care under the court's order, highlighting the chaotic impact of the legislation on low-income patient access to healthcare.</p>

A key factor in this turnaround is the state's relative financial independence from Washington D.C., as the study incorporated new metrics gauging risks from potential federal budget cuts. The state's economy, the most heavily weighted category, improved significantly. However, Massachusetts still faces challenges, including being the second-most-expensive state to do business in and having the nation's highest wage costs, alongside a heavy regulatory environment that hampers its business-friendliness rating.

The analysis points to the Trump Organization's real estate deals with autocratic regimes, the acceptance of a $400 million jet from Qatar, and the use of lawsuits against media organizations that result in settlements benefiting Trump's interests. The author contends that the dismantling of anti-corruption agencies and norms, combined with a favorable Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, has created an environment where foreign and domestic entities can seek influence through financial means, setting a new bar for kleptocracy.</p>
