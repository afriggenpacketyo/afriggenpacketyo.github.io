          <p>Mexican authorities, in coordination with U.S. federal agencies including the FBI, arrested three individuals, one of whom is an American citizen and another a dual national, in Ciudad Juárez and seized 110,000 fentanyl pills. The arrests followed intelligence work and surveillance actions, leading to the discovery of the pills divided into 10 clear plastic packages inside a vehicle. The suspects have been handed over to the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the seized pills are now in police custody, as this operation is part of Mexico's broader efforts to combat illegal drug distribution and prevent drugs from reaching young people under President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski, known for throwing triple-digit fastballs, made MLB history after taking a perfect game into the seventh inning in his second career start.

After issuing a walk and then allowing a home run, Misiorowski was pulled from the game to a standing ovation, having thrown 86 pitches, 60 for strikes, as the Brewers went on to secure a 17-6 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</p>

The Fed kept interest rates unchanged, acknowledging both positive and negative economic indicators, as the Fed is expecting higher inflation this year than it did in March, which would support the need for higher interest rates.

          <p>A pilot in North Carolina died after raising a wheel on landing to avoid a turtle on the runway, according to a preliminary NTSB report. The communications operator warned the pilot about the turtle, and the pilot landed about 1,400 feet down the runway before lifting the right main wheel, after which the plane crashed in a heavily forested area. The pilot and a passenger were killed, while a second passenger was seriously injured, as the NTSB continues to investigate the crash.</p>

          <p>The UK experienced its hottest day of the year, with temperatures surpassing 33C, as a heatwave intensifies across the country, and a Met Office warning is in place for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Wales due to potential thunderstorms. An amber heat-health alert is in effect in England, with research suggesting hundreds of heat-related deaths may occur in the coming days, as passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault amidst the high temperatures. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change.</p>

          <p>Experts say US sunscreens are less effective than those available overseas, particularly in protecting against ultraviolet radiation in the form of UVA rays, as a heatwave approaches. The concern stems from regulatory differences, as sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug in the US, leading to a lengthy approval process for new UV-filtering ingredients. While US sunscreens generally do a good job at blocking UVB rays, experts point out that the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in more than 20 years, as a bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations.</p>
