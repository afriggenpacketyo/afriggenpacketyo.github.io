        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, citing a lack of significant inflation boost from tariffs. In a CNBC interview, Waller emphasized a gradual easing approach, suggesting that current inflation levels do not pose a substantial economic threat. He advocated for proactive rate cuts to mitigate potential labor market slowdowns, cautioning against waiting for a market crash before acting. Waller's perspective contrasts with other officials who are hesitant to cut rates due to uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Contagion Research Institute reveals that foreign adversaries, particularly Russia and Iran, are using social media to sow division within the MAGA movement. These entities employ thousands of bots to amplify extreme rhetoric and artificially inflate the influence of content creators promoting radical agendas. The manipulation aims to create a false perception of widespread division and animosity, particularly on platforms like X, where hate speech and divisive content are being amplified. The report suggests targeting bot farms and the countries that support them as a means to combat this malign foreign influence.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting a yellow warning for thunderstorms in parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The Met Office forecasts torrential downpours, localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning from Saturday afternoon into Sunday. An amber heat-health alert is in effect until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. While the current heat is record-breaking for 2025, temperatures remain below the June peak of 35.6C in 1976, and some relief is anticipated on Sunday with cooler air moving in from the west.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel presents India with a challenging diplomatic situation, requiring a delicate balance between its relationships with both nations. India maintains strong ties with Israel in defense and technology while also valuing its historical and strategic connections with Iran, particularly regarding energy security and regional connectivity. India's approach involves strategic ambiguity and nonalignment to avoid being drawn into the conflict, prioritizing its national interests and geopolitical stability. The country has also launched "Operation Sindhu" to evacuate its nationals from both Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>The conversation around transitioning to clean energy and net zero is dominated by cost, especially for households considering electric vehicles (EVs). Incentives like London's Cleaner Vehicle Discount (CVD) are crucial, but more is needed to supercharge the switch. To truly promote EV adoption, both industry and government must reduce the cost and complexity involved, addressing concerns about charging costs and reliability. Subscription models that remove upfront costs and include cashback for charging can make EVs more accessible and affordable.</p>

          <p>China's export shipments of magnets to the US experienced a significant decline in May, plummeting by 93.3% year-on-year due to Beijing's rare earth curbs.

This drastic decrease, resulting from export controls imposed by Beijing, has put pressure on US manufacturers in sectors like defense, energy, and automotive.

This automation is already affecting entry-level hiring in professions like law, with the potential to render many skills obsolete.
