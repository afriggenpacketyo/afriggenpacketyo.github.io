          <p>Reports indicate a rising number of U.S. military veterans and their family members are being detained or deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration. The article highlights several cases, including the deportation of a veteran's son born on a U.S. army base who holds no citizenship, and the detention of a Marine's wife who was breastfeeding. These actions are part of a broader push for mass deportations, with ICE data showing a significant increase in the detention of individuals with no criminal record. The incidents have drawn criticism for disrespecting military service and creating fear within veteran communities.</p>

          <p>California Republican Representative Young Kim has indicated she will oppose the new version of President Trump's major tax and spending bill if changes made by the Senate, particularly concerning Medicaid, are not reversed. The article states that Kim is one of several moderate Republicans expressing serious concerns to House Speaker Mike Johnson about the Senate's text. The primary issue involves modifications to Medicaid provider taxes, which moderates argue would unfairly impact states and harm hospitals. With a narrow GOP majority in the House, this opposition could jeopardize the bill's final passage.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya have resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, with reports of police using live ammunition against demonstrators. The government's attempt to ban live media coverage of the protests has intensified concerns over press freedom, even though a court quickly revoked the order. Journalists and social media activists have been targeted, with some facing violence or arrest under a controversial cybercrime law. The protests, largely driven by "Generation Z," reflect deep dissatisfaction with the economic situation and President William Ruto's government, which has labeled the demonstrations a "coup attempt."</p>

          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party held a congress bidding farewell to former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who used his speech to defend his government's policies and warn against Russian aggression. In a separate address on Armed Forces Day, current Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized that Germany's security cannot be taken for granted and called for greater defense efforts. Meanwhile, the UN has urged Germany to resume its participation in a refugee resettlement program, which was suspended after the recent change in government.

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's primary victory for New York City mayor, Republican leaders are using his self-identification as a democratic socialist to frame the entire Democratic party as radical. Figures like Donald Trump and RNC Chair Michael Whatley have labeled Mamdani a "communist" to energize their base, while some moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from him. The article notes that this strategy also includes what some critics call Islamophobic attacks on Mamdani's background. In response, Mamdani has focused on his platform of addressing inequality, while some Democrats defend him against the attacks but remain divided on his policies.</p>

          <p>The social media accounts of several deceased U.S. lawmakers, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Rep. Gerry Connolly, have remained active, posting endorsements and campaign messages from beyond the grave. This phenomenon has sparked confusion and debate online, highlighting a lack of clear protocols for managing the digital legacy of politicians. The article explains that while congressional offices may remain open for constituent services after a member's death, there are no official rules for their social media. This raises concerns about security, constituent communication, and the ethical implications of posthumous political messaging.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The nearly 1,000-page Republican bill before the Senate aims to make Trump-era tax cuts permanent while introducing new ones, such as for tips and overtime pay. It allocates significant funding for border security, including a wall and mass deportations, and boosts defense spending. To offset these costs, the legislation proposes major cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food stamps by implementing new work requirements and other restrictions. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the House version would increase the number of uninsured Americans and add trillions to the national deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

While the event brings glamour and a reported multi-million euro donation from Bezos for city preservation, it has fueled the debate over "over-tourism" and its impact on Venice. Protesters argue that billionaires using the city as a private "amusement park" exacerbates problems for residents facing eviction and a loss of community. However, some Venetians, including the city's deputy mayor, welcome the "high-quality tourism" as a needed economic boost.</p>

The march was not only a stand for LGBTQ+ rights but also a protest against what many see as eroding democratic freedoms in Hungary. The massive turnout, supported by numerous EU officials, was viewed as a major demonstration of civil society's strength against the government's policies.</p>

Klopp warned that the intense schedule could lead to unprecedented injuries and a decline in performance quality, which would ultimately devalue the sport.

          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Bangkok, demanding Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra resign over her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. The demonstrations, organized by a nationalist group, were sparked by a leaked phone call in which the prime minister's comments to Cambodia's former leader were seen as deferential and damaging to national pride. The long-standing dispute concerns the historic Preah Vihear temple, which an international court ruled belongs to Cambodia. The protests reflect growing public dissatisfaction and nationalist sentiment regarding the government's foreign policy approach with its neighbor.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced it will eliminate artificial colors from its entire product line, including brands like Hostess, by the end of 2027. This move follows similar commitments from other major food corporations like Nestle, Conagra, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills. The decision aligns with increased federal scrutiny of synthetic dyes, such as the recent ban on Red 3 due to potential health risks. The company noted that many of its products are already free from these additives, but items like some sugar-free jams and Hostess snack cakes still contain them.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is under severe strain after the Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party, pulled out of President Cyril Ramaphosa's "National Dialogue" initiative. The move came after Ramaphosa dismissed a DA deputy minister, prompting the DA to demand the removal of allegedly corrupt ministers from the ruling ANC party. DA leader John Steenhuisen accused Ramaphosa of "double standards" but confirmed the party would remain in the government for now.

The operation involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them from close range, bypassing conventional air defenses. This low-cost, high-impact strategy demonstrates that rear-area bases, once considered safe, are now vulnerable. The article argues this playbook could be replicated elsewhere, forcing militaries worldwide to rethink airbase security and accept that their runways are now a new front line in modern warfare.</p>
