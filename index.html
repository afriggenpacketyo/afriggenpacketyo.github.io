          <p>The U.S. Senate has initiated a "vote-a-rama," a rapid-fire series of votes on numerous amendments to President Trump's major domestic spending package. This procedural marathon allows both parties to force votes on politically sensitive topics, often for strategic messaging rather than legislative success. Democrats are using the process to highlight controversial aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid work requirements, while some Republicans are using it to register dissent on specific items. The outcome will shape the final version of the bill as Senate leadership navigates a very narrow majority.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will sign an executive order to terminate the majority of U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to support the country's stability following the collapse of the Assad regime. This move follows months of lobbying by Syria's new transitional government, which argues the sanctions have hindered economic recovery and reconstruction. While broad sanctions will be lifted to encourage new investment, targeted sanctions will remain on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and entities linked to human rights abuses or terrorism.</p>

          <p>Deliberations have begun in the federal trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, but a potential issue has already emerged from within the jury room. The jury foreperson sent a note to the judge expressing concern that one juror, identified as Juror #25, is having difficulty following the judge's legal instructions. The judge is now considering how to address the situation, which could complicate the jury's task of reaching a verdict on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. Combs, who has denied all charges, awaits the verdict from the 12-person panel in Manhattan.</p>

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's proposed spending bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for service workers, a move the White House champions as relief for the working class. However, the proposal is receiving criticism for its limited scope and temporary nature, as the tax cut would expire in 2028. Policy analysts note that over a third of tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income tax anyway, meaning they would not benefit. Critics argue that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-wage workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former U.S. women's soccer star Abby Wambach described the Trump administration as "geniuses" for their ability to foster a strong sense of community among their supporters. Speaking on a podcast, Wambach analyzed the political landscape from a team-building perspective, suggesting this skill allows supporters to overlook controversial policies. She believes this strategy effectively keeps people invested in a movement they perceive as good, even with negative consequences. Wambach also speculated that some Trump voters may be questioning their choice but feel too entrenched in that community to change their minds.</p>

Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, announced he would not seek reelection after opposing the bill's Medicaid provisions, highlighting the pressure within the GOP.

          <p>Athletic apparel company Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the wholesale retailer of selling "knockoff" versions of its popular products, including its Define jacket and Scuba hoodie. The lawsuit claims that Costco's products are so similar that they infringe on Lululemon's "trade dress," confusing consumers and unfairly capitalizing on its brand reputation. Lululemon is seeking damages and an order for Costco to stop selling the items in question. The lawsuit highlights the growing trend of affordable "dupes" that closely mimic high-end brands.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has suffered its most significant first-half decline in over 50 years, falling more than 10% against a basket of other major currencies since the start of 2025. This sharp sell-off is attributed to investor concerns over President Trump's economic policies, including widespread tariffs and a budget bill expected to increase national debt. Analysts suggest these factors, combined with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, are eroding the dollar's traditional role as a safe-haven asset. The decline has pushed the dollar index to its lowest point since March 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada has canceled its planned digital services tax (DST) in a strategic move to bring the United States back to the negotiating table for a crucial trade and defense deal. The 3% tax, which would have primarily affected large U.S. tech companies, was labeled a "blatant attack" by President Trump, who had suspended negotiations in response. By shelving the tax, Canada has potentially averted retaliatory tariffs and revived talks with its largest trading partner.

          <p>The economic relationship between the United States and Canada has been tense since President Trump took office, marked by a series of tariff threats and negotiations.

While some tariffs were paused, new ones on autos and steel followed, creating significant friction. The latest flashpoint was Canada's planned Digital Service Tax, which prompted the U.S. to suspend talks until Canada reversed its policy, setting the stage for renewed negotiations.</p>

          <p>In England's recent Test victory over India, the performance of fast bowler Josh Tongue in dismissing India's lower-order batsmen was a decisive factor. An analysis in this article highlights that quickly and ruthlessly removing the "tail" is a critical, often overlooked skill in Test cricket, preventing opponents from adding valuable late-inning runs. Tongue's aggressive and intimidating bowling was particularly effective, taking three wickets in each innings against India's last four batsmen. This ability to prevent the opposition's tail from "wagging" will be essential for England's success in future series, including the upcoming Ashes.</p>

          <p>Legendary entertainer Dick Van Dyke, who is 99 years old, was unable to host his recurring "Vandy Camp" fan event due to an unspecified illness. His wife, Arlene Silver, informed the audience that while he has good and bad days, that particular day was unfortunately not a good one for him. Silver hosted the event, described as a "whimsical, vintage circus," on her own, and attendees sent well wishes to the beloved actor, who was reportedly watching from home. The event took place at the couple's namesake theater at Malibu High School.</p>

          <p>Following Canada's decision to rescind its digital services tax (DST), a senior White House official indicated that the Trump administration expects other countries to do the same. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the removal of such taxes will be a key part of ongoing trade negotiations. The administration views these taxes, which primarily target large U.S. tech firms, as unfair trade practices. The statement signals a hardline U.S. stance and suggests that countries maintaining DSTs could face retaliatory actions as the administration finalizes its tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has announced its intention to acquire GMS, a major distributor of building products, in a deal valued at approximately $4.3 billion. This strategic purchase is part of the retailer's ongoing effort to capture a larger share of the lucrative market for professional contractors, such as electricians and renovators. The acquisition, which will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary SRS Distribution, is expected to close by early 2026. The move also effectively ends a potential hostile takeover bid for GMS from another building-products distributor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Royal Mail has reported that its staff in the UK were subjected to nearly 2,200 dog attacks in the past year, highlighting a significant safety risk for postal workers. The highest number of incidents were recorded in the Sheffield and Portsmouth postcode areas. Experts from the Royal Veterinary College have raised concerns that many dogs acquired during the pandemic may be more prone to problem behaviors due to a lack of socialization with strangers.
