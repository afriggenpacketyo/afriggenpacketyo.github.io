          <p>The FBI conducted a court-authorized search at former National Security Advisor John Bolton's residence in Bethesda, Maryland, confirming the activity was linked to a classified documents investigation. Bolton, who served under President Trump, had previously faced legal challenges from the Trump administration over his memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," which was alleged to contain classified information without proper prepublication review. Although the Biden administration later closed that specific inquiry and dropped the lawsuit against him, this new search underscores persistent federal scrutiny into the handling of sensitive government materials by former high-ranking officials. The FBI reassured the public that there was no immediate threat to safety during the operation.</p>

          <p>Representative Ilhan Omar publicly condemned the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) for revoking its endorsement of state Senator Omar Fateh, a self-described democratic socialist running for Minneapolis mayor. Omar labeled the decision "inexcusable," asserting that a small group, mostly residing outside Minneapolis, overrode the democratic process of local delegates. This action highlights significant internal divisions within the Democratic Party, particularly the friction between its progressive and moderate wings. Fateh, who was the first Black mayoral candidate to receive DFL endorsement in three decades, had previously unseated the current mayor in the endorsing convention.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday as investors eagerly awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's address at the Jackson Hole economic forum. Market participants are closely scrutinizing his remarks for any hints regarding a potential interest rate cut at the central bank's upcoming September meeting, especially given the Fed's cautious stance this year despite pressure for lower rates. The Federal Reserve faces the complex task of balancing inflation control with maximum employment, a challenge exacerbated by recent job growth slowdowns and tariff-driven price increases. Powell's assessment of inflation trends towards the 2% target will be a key determinant for market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez is scheduled for a parole board hearing in California, following his brother Erik's denial of parole the previous day. Both brothers were convicted in 1996 for the 1989 murders of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in Beverly Hills, and recently became eligible for parole under the state's youth offender law. They have consistently maintained that they acted in self-defense after enduring years of alleged physical, sexual, and emotional abuse from their parents, a claim contested by the Los Angeles County District Attorney. Erik's parole was rejected largely due to documented prison policy violations, despite the panel's acknowledgment of the tragic family history and alleged abuse.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court ruling that granted Epping Forest District Council a temporary injunction, preventing asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is committed to closing all asylum hotels in a "properly managed way," arguing against piecemeal court decisions that could create problems elsewhere. This legal challenge arises amid significant local protests and community tensions, exacerbated by an alleged sexual assault involving an asylum seeker from the hotel. The government remains legally bound to provide accommodation for asylum seekers awaiting claim decisions.</p>

          <p>Major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, indicate that rising tariff costs have not yet significantly impacted consumer spending, as they implement creative strategies to mitigate price increases. These tactics involve diversifying supply chains, negotiating with vendors, and selectively adjusting prices to avoid spooking customers or attracting White House scrutiny. While overall consumer spending remains resilient, lower-income households show greater sensitivity to price shifts. Some companies, like Walmart, are leveraging new revenue streams such as advertising and third-party marketplaces to bolster earnings amidst economic pressures. The evolving trade landscape continues to present challenges and uncertainties for the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Florida state government controversially painted over a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that served as a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub mass shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer condemned the "callous action" as a "cruel political act," emphasizing that the community's dedication to honoring the victims cannot be erased. This move aligns with a series of anti-LGBTQ+ laws and measures passed under Governor Ron DeSantis's administration, drawing sharp criticism from Democratic state senators and LGBTQ+ advocates. Opponents argue that the removal, conducted under cover of night, reflects a hostile stance against the city's memorial efforts and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>A new 1% tax on cash remittances, included in President Donald Trump's recent spending bill, is poised to drain billions from the world's poorest families, starting January 1, 2026. This "hidden tax" is projected to cost Haitians approximately $61 million annually and result in a global loss of about $4.5 billion, potentially exacerbating existing humanitarian crises. Immigrant rights advocates argue this measure, coupled with significant cuts to USAID, dismantles a vital global social safety net, particularly for countries heavily reliant on remittances for essential needs like food, housing, and medical care. Critics warn that such policies could further destabilize vulnerable nations and drive more people into extreme poverty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This personal essay chronicles the author's search for a life partner in Los Angeles, a quest initially influenced by his mother's desire for him to marry a Jewish woman. Defying these expectations, he encountered a diverse array of women, including a Russian emigrant, an art gallery employee, and a Michael Jackson impersonator. His journey ultimately led him to Carol, a Korean woman, resulting in an interfaith marriage that beautifully integrated Jewish and Korean traditions, complete with a chuppah and hanboks. The article celebrates their unique union and the subsequent creation of their mixed-race, interfaith family, with their daughter symbolizing the unifying force of their diverse backgrounds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced a "continuous vetting" process for over 55 million visa holders, involving a review of records for potential violations such as overstays, criminal activity, or threats to public safety and national security. This broad initiative, a key component of President Donald Trump's stringent anti-immigration agenda, also includes social media vetting to identify "anti-American ideologies" or hostility towards U.S. institutions. Visas will be revoked for individuals showing support for terrorist organizations or perpetrating unlawful antisemitic harassment. This move follows recent actions like pausing worker visas for truck drivers and imposing high deposits for citizens from certain African nations, signaling a significant tightening of U.S. immigration policies.</p>

The storm, which briefly intensified to a Category 5 before weakening to Category 1, brought tropical storm conditions and coastal flooding to areas including North Carolina's Outer Banks and Virginia, leading to evacuations and numerous beach rescues.

          <p>Myanmar's military rulers have ended the state of emergency and scheduled national elections for December 28, 2025, transferring power to an interim civilian government. However, analysts view these moves as "purely symbolic" and a "disguise" for continued military rule, aimed at dividing the opposition rather than unifying the country. The regime controls less than half the country, and international monitors have condemned the polls as a charade. Economic pressures and regional frustration over the civil war's spillover have intensified calls for elections, with China and Russia expected to endorse the outcome, while Western countries will likely reject it.</p>
