          <p>A US-based dating app, Tea Dating Advice, designed for women to conduct background checks, suffered a major data breach. Over 70,000 images, including verification IDs and selfies, were leaked and posted online, leading to maps showing 33,000 user addresses. This breach caused significant fear among users, including one who worried her stalker ex-partner could now find her. Google has since removed the maps, and multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed against the company, which is offering identity theft services.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission (ECI) is under scrutiny due to opposition allegations of voter fraud, manipulation, and inconsistencies in electoral rolls. Rahul Gandhi, a prominent opposition leader, has launched a protest march, claiming the ECI colluded with the ruling party to rig the 2024 general elections. The ECI denies these claims, calling them misleading, and has demanded an affidavit from Gandhi. This article highlights the challenges to the ECI's long-standing reputation as a trusted institution.</p>

The initiative is part of a 'whole-of-government approach' to address national security threats, according to a DHS spokesperson.

The initial report of a kidnapping from a store parking lot was determined to be false, with investigators citing inconsistencies in the mother's story. This article notes the father's prior conviction for child cruelty in 2023, and another child was recently removed from their home. The search for Emmanuel's body continues, as authorities seek justice for the tragic incident.</p>

The company had relentlessly pursued Robinson for thousands in charges, despite her efforts to pay and the rule being criticized by MPs and subsequently banned. This article highlights Robinson's perseverance and the eventual legal victory, which she hopes will empower others facing similar unjust demands against predatory parking practices.</p>
