          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a standout performance in its trading division. The bank posted earnings of $10.91 per share on $14.58 billion in revenue, surpassing estimates as its trading operations generated $840 million more than anticipated. The strong report contributed to the bank's stock climbing 23% year-to-date, reflecting a broader trend of major U.S. banks benefiting from resilient market conditions in the first half of the year.

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, increased amid renewed investor optimism that the U.S. House could pass key stablecoin legislation this week. The GENUIS Act, if passed, would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which has been seen as a positive step for the industry's legitimacy. Despite a temporary dip when the bills failed to advance, market players and analysts remain confident that the legislation's passage is a matter of when, not if, providing a boost to crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and Circle.

          <p>The man accused of fatally shooting Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in June has been indicted on six federal charges, including stalking and murder. Prosecutors state that Vance Boelter, 57, could face life in prison or the death penalty for what they termed targeted political assassinations. According to court documents, Boelter also shot and wounded another state senator and his wife, and had plans for a larger attack that was thwarted by police. He remains in custody and has not yet entered a plea.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary, John Healey, has stated he is "unable to say for sure" if anyone was killed following a significant data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who aided British forces. The data was mistakenly leaked in February 2022, but the government only learned of it in August 2023. A super-injunction hiding the breach was recently lifted, prompting political scrutiny and apologies. A special resettlement scheme has brought 4,500 affected Afghans to the UK, but hundreds of soldiers and their families are believed to still be in Afghanistan.</p>

The administration's suggestion to replace them with Medicaid recipients required to work is dismissed as unrealistic.

The effort is spurred by large, opaque donations, including a Boeing 747 from Qatar and multimillion-dollar legal settlements from major corporations. The proposed legislation would cap individual donations at $10,000 while a president is in office, require quarterly disclosures, and impose a "cooling-off" period for foreign donations.

          <p>This article analyzes the political fallout from the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, arguing it represents a fundamental betrayal of the MAGA movement's populist ideology. By dismissing the issue and demanding loyalty to his Attorney General, Trump is shifting from a narrative of "the people vs. the corrupt elite" to one of personalist authority. The Epstein case had become a core symbol of elite corruption for his base, and his current stance exposes a conflict between his populist rhetoric and his personal political interests, testing the loyalty of his supporters.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that while the home run swing-off that ended this year's All-Star Game was exciting, Major League Baseball must innovate further to keep the event relevant. The author suggests that the Home Run Derby itself could be enhanced with creative elements like judging bat flips for flair, similar to an NBA slam dunk contest. The article also addresses the issue of top players withdrawing from the game, proposing a schedule change to encourage participation. The central argument is that the league needs to actively cultivate entertainment and ensure its best talent is showcased.</p>

          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over their responsibilities, also suggests standardized uniforms and a rule preventing them from making new diagnoses before a patient is triaged. The recommendations follow tragic cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. While the doctor's union, the BMA, feels the review could have gone further, the union for PAs has expressed concern that the new limits could lengthen waiting lists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods group Richemont reported a 6% rise in quarterly sales, slightly beating analyst expectations, though its growth was hampered by a significant downturn in Japan. Sales in Japan fell 15% as a strengthening yen reduced spending by tourists, particularly from China, ending a period of currency-fueled growth for the region's luxury market. However, the owner of Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels was buoyed by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division, which saw sales rise 11%. The results show Richemont as a relative bright spot in a broader luxury sector slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A volcanic eruption on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula has once again forced the evacuation of the popular Blue Lagoon geothermal spa and a nearby campsite in the town of Grindavik. The eruption began early Wednesday following intense seismic activity, with lava flowing from a fissure nearly a mile wide. Iceland's Met Office reported that the lava flow is not currently threatening any infrastructure, and the town of Grindavik is not in danger. This is the latest in a series of disruptive eruptions in the area since a volcano, dormant for 800 years, reawakened in late 2023.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Indonesia have finalized a trade deal that will reduce American tariffs on Indonesian goods from a proposed 32% down to 19%. President Trump stated the reduction was in exchange for "full access" for American firms into the Indonesian market. As part of the agreement, Indonesia will reportedly purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The pact is the latest development following the White House's tariff threats against dozens of countries, aimed at renegotiating trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critiques the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly its tariffs and immigration restrictions, arguing they are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S. labor market. The author contends that with unemployment near historic lows, there is no large pool of idle American workers to fill the jobs that would be created by protectionist trade policies or vacated by mass deportations. The administration's proposed solutions, such as pushing Medicaid recipients into the workforce, are dismissed as fantastical. The piece concludes that these policies will likely lead to labor shortages, inflation, and geopolitical isolation.</p>

The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, brought by Peggie against the health board under the Equality Act, resumed.

This action temporarily stopped the assailant, allowing the church's armed security team to intervene and fatally shoot the suspect.
