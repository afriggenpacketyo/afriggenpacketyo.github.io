          <p>The U.S. air traffic control system is under immense pressure due to years of understaffing, lack of investment, and outdated equipment, as highlighted by recent equipment failures at Newark Liberty International Airport. These outages have led to significant flight delays, affecting thousands of travelers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has proposed a plan to overhaul the system, replacing old radar and communication systems, which could cost billions and require congressional approval. Airlines and unions support the upgrades, emphasizing the need for smart investments to maintain aviation safety standards, with United Airlines already cutting flights to ease the strain on operations at Newark. This article underscores the urgency to modernize the air traffic control system to prevent future disruptions and ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are advocating for a "full, unconditional ceasefire" with Russia for at least 30 days, commencing on Monday, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

The author suggests that ensuring economic and social support for people who want children is crucial, and that progressive policies such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare could help address this issue.

Critics argue that individuals seeking influence with the president can enrich him by buying his cryptocurrency, undermining public trust and national security.

The result is that many low-wage workers struggle to make a decent living due to inconsistent schedules and fluctuating paychecks, and the author suggests policy changes to address the problem of underwork and ensure workers have access to stable, predictable employment.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has filed a lawsuit against the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV) after the agency labeled the far-right party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The BfV has complied with the AfD's request to follow a "standstill commitment," putting its official reclassification of the AfD on hold, but the classification was not withdrawn. This decision allows the court time to properly review the case, and experts emphasize that this is routine administrative procedure and does not indicate the AfD's likelihood of success in the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a rocket booster failure. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious space program and its focus on Venus exploration during that era. The article also highlights the challenges of building spacecraft capable of withstanding Venus's harsh conditions, and the legacy of the Venera program, which achieved several firsts in planetary exploration.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has implemented a strategy to increase global dependence on China's exports and manufacturing, aiming to counter foreign interference. This approach involves increasing state-controlled lending to industries, imposing export controls on critical minerals, and using antimonopoly laws to retaliate against American companies. While this strategy has strengthened China's position in certain sectors, it has also led to increased tensions with trading partners and internal economic challenges, including a property crisis and weakened consumer confidence. The article questions whether this approach will ultimately enable China to surpass the United States as the dominant superpower.</p>

While European leaders are willing to invest more in weapons production, it will take time to increase production capacity, and the focus on their own protection diminishes what they can provide to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's White House has launched a media offensive characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts designed to engage his base and dominate the "attention economy." The administration's approach involves bypassing traditional media outlets and using viral far-right culture to connect directly with supporters, often through provocative imagery and messaging. Critics warn that this strategy undermines decency and promotes unchecked misinformation, while supporters argue it effectively communicates the president's message and disrupts conventional political norms. The approach has included the use of AI-generated images, ASMR videos, and direct attacks on political opponents.</p>
