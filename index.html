          <p>Japan's real wages experienced a decrease of 1.8% in April, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline, according to Kyodo News. This trend indicates ongoing challenges in the Japanese economy, as real wages reflect the purchasing power of workers after accounting for inflation. The continued decline may impact consumer spending and overall economic growth in Japan. Further analysis will be needed to determine the underlying causes and potential policy responses to address this issue. The economic outlook is uncertain as the situation develops.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging Americans to tell lawmakers to "kill the bill." Musk argues that the bill would increase the US budget deficit and burden Americans with unsustainable debt. This marks Musk's first public disagreement with Trump since leaving his role in the administration, where he worked on cutting costs. The White House has defended the bill, asserting that it will improve the fiscal trajectory of the United States and unleash economic growth. The bill faces opposition from various factions within the Republican Party, creating challenges for its passage in the Senate.</p>

Johnson acknowledged policy differences but maintained that he considers Musk a friend. The Senate is proceeding with the legislation despite the controversy, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledging Musk's influence but downplaying his sway over Senate Republicans.

          <p>Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, has responded to the Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) decision to classify his organization as a "hate group," calling the label "discouraging" and "dangerous." The SPLC's classification stems from Focus on the Family's belief in traditional marriage, which Daly says they will not abandon despite societal shifts. Daly cited the 2012 shooting at Family Research Council, another Christian nonprofit labeled as hateful by the SPLC, as a potential consequence of such labels. He emphasized that Focus on the Family remains committed to its work in foster care, pregnancy resource services, and marital support, questioning why an organization doing so much good would be targeted. The organization is considering a legal response to the SPLC's designation.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman on trial for serving poisonous death cap mushrooms that killed three of her guests, testified that she was trying to fix a "bland" meal. Patterson denies intentionally poisoning her estranged husband's parents and their relative, claiming the tainted beef Wellington was a tragic accident. She stated that she believed she was using dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket and that she foraged wild mushrooms weeks before the incident. Patterson admitted to lying about having cancer to her in-laws and said she threw up after the meal, which may have spared her from the worst effects.

OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after facing homophobic acts of violence in Guatemala. The Trump administration said federal immigration officials were working to bring OCG back to the United States.

Isaacman suggested the timing of the withdrawal was related to Musk's criticism of Trump's tax-cut bill. He has led two private spaceflights through SpaceX and Shift4 invested in SpaceX.

Recent graduates face a challenging job market, with unemployment rates at their highest since 2021. While the college wage premium remains high, its growth has stagnated since 2010, and the relative value of college for lower-income students has declined.

Both Egypt and Greece agreed to work together to protect the monastery's rights and legal status.

Judge James Boasberg found that the men, removed under the Alien Enemies Act, had been "plainly deprived" of their due process rights. The administration argued the law allows deporting Venezuelans identified as gang members, but the judge rejected this. The Justice Department has one week to say how it will provide the men an opportunity to seek relief under habeas corpus.
