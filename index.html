          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:43:46 EDT</div>

          <p>The death toll from a multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has tragically risen to 16, with search and rescue operations continuing for a second day. Officials confirmed that ten more bodies were recovered overnight, adding to the six found immediately after the collapse on Friday. At least eight more people are believed to be trapped under the debris, but rescue efforts are hampered by the building's location on a narrow street. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards and a lack of regulation often lead to unsafe structures.</p>

          <p>A physician working at a public hospital describes the harsh realities his patients face, arguing that new Medicaid work requirements will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. The article uses the example of a homeless patient with severe scoliosis who, despite being medically exempt, would struggle to navigate the bureaucracy to prove his status due to a lack of a fixed address, phone, or ID. The author contends that these administrative hurdles, or "time tax," are designed to cut costs by disenrolling people who are entitled to benefits, projecting that millions will lose insurance as a result.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for Reform UK, has had the party whip removed following allegations concerning business propriety during the pandemic, before he was elected. The party's chief whip stated that McMurdock removed the whip from himself pending a full investigation, with which he has agreed to cooperate. This development reduces Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four. McMurdock is the second of the five Reform MPs elected in 2024 to lose the whip, reflecting ongoing turmoil within the party's small parliamentary group.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researcher Mo Gawdat promotes a '90-second rule' for better emotional regulation, based on the work of neuroscientist Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor. The concept posits that it takes only 90 seconds for the physiological effects of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline to dissipate from the body. After this initial period, any lingering anger or upset is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-engaging with the negative thought. By allowing oneself this brief window to feel the emotion and then choosing to shift focus, individuals can avoid prolonged rumination and recover more quickly from life's daily frustrations.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies. The experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by building community, and redefine her concept of self-care away from passive appointments to active engagement. The article argues that hobbies are not a luxury to be pursued after finding work-life balance, but are the very secret to achieving it by forcing individuals to set boundaries and find joy outside of obligations.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Arwa Mahdawi argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inadequacy in addressing intimate partner violence. While Combs was convicted on lesser charges, he was acquitted of the most serious ones, which the author suggests is because existing domestic violence and coercive control laws are often ill-equipped to handle cases involving wealthy and powerful abusers. The article contends that prosecutors often turn to trafficking charges due to longer statutes of limitations and more severe penalties, highlighting a systemic failure to achieve justice for survivors of domestic abuse.</p>

This figure is more than double that of the second-ranked state, North Carolina. The primary draws for Florida include its lack of state income tax, which means Social Security benefits and retirement account withdrawals are not taxed, as well as an absence of estate or inheritance tax.

          <p>This article explores the idea of detaching exercise from the goal of weight loss and instead finding forms of movement that foster a sense of well-being and bodily comfort. For many, physical activity has been linked to an aesthetic goal, but this can create a negative association. By finding a new community or type of movement, such as weight lifting or running, individuals can rewire this connection. The piece suggests that the most effective fitness routines are those that make a person feel strong and comfortable in their body, rather than simply pursuing a specific physical appearance.</p>

This exchange of fire occurred after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone call with President Donald Trump to discuss strengthening Ukraine's air defenses and efforts to end the war, though Trump later expressed disappointment with a separate call to Vladimir Putin.</p>

Unlike many sci-fi narratives where AI yearns for human connection, Murderbot finds humans messy and prefers to be treated as a machine.

          <p>This commentary reflects on the soft power of the British monarchy, highlighted by the upcoming granting of Royal Warrants by the Prince and Princess of Wales. These warrants, a seal of approval on goods and services, bestow a touch of class and an image of quality that is particularly popular with consumers, including those in America. The article humorously notes a recent poll where a surprising number of young Americans said they would favor replacing the U.S. President with the British monarch. This suggests that despite a lack of formal power, the royal family's influence as cultural influencers remains potent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has voiced her distrust of the electronic line-calling system being used at Wimbledon this year, which has replaced human line judges. Following her loss to Aryna Sabalenka, Raducanu pointed to several "dodgy" calls she felt were incorrect, a sentiment echoed by other players like Jack Draper. The controversy centers on the perceived inaccuracy of the automated system, with players also complaining that the 'out' calls are too quiet to hear in a noisy stadium. Despite the criticism, All England Club officials have expressed confidence in the technology's accuracy and its implementation.</p>

          <p>Eight member nations of the OPEC+ alliance, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the 411,000-barrel increase that was anticipated and continues the process of unwinding previous voluntary supply cuts. In a statement, the OPEC Secretariat cited a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories, as the basis for their decision. This move signals the group's confidence in current market stability and demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article profiles the Reverend William Barber and the revived Poor People's Campaign, a national movement dedicated to fighting poverty and systemic injustice through nonviolent moral protest. Drawing on a prophetic tradition, Barber frames policies that harm the poor, such as cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, as "policy murder." The movement organizes diverse, "fusion" coalitions to bear witness and demand a moral reckoning in the public square. It aims not just to resist a single administration but to challenge the deeper political and religious structures that perpetuate inequality in America.</p>

Researchers describe the OGC as a new breed of extremist organization that builds offline social networks to mainstream far-right activism.

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop, is facing a severe crisis due to a combination of factors. Climate change is causing more volatile weather, including early thaws followed by damaging frosts, which has devastated this year's harvest. Additionally, farmers are grappling with rising land prices due to development, labor shortages for harvesting and processing, and the economic impact of tariffs. These compounding threats are putting multigenerational family farms in dire straits and endangering one of Michigan's most iconic and economically significant specialty crops.</p>

          <p>Fears of a potential serial killer are growing in Austin, Texas, after authorities have recovered 38 bodies from the city's Lady Bird Lake since 2022, with 30 of them being men.

A forensic psychiatrist quoted in the article argues that the consistencies cannot be ignored and that dismissing the possibility of a serial killer is premature without further investigation into the morbid coincidences.</p>

          <p>A new study from researchers at several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in impotence drugs like Viagra, may have cancer-fighting properties. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug can strengthen the body's anti-tumor immune response by restoring dendritic cells. These crucial immune cells, which act as intelligence agents for the immune system, often become depleted or impaired as cancer progresses. The discovery is being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy, offering hope for a novel approach to cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>This column critiques the recent rise of the "tradwife" (traditional wife) movement, which encourages young women to prioritize marriage and homemaking over careers. The author argues this is a tired, anti-feminist trope that ignores the historical context of gender inequality and the crucial rights secured by the feminist movement, such as property ownership, equal pay, and reproductive freedom. The piece points out the hypocrisy of successful career women promoting this lifestyle and suggests that it wrongly blames feminism for women's unhappiness, rather than the broader stresses of modern life.</p>

While Israeli and U.S. strikes significantly damaged enrichment facilities and killed key scientists, experts believe Iran retains the foundational knowledge, technology, and materials to reconstitute its program. Iran has already moved to limit international inspections, signaling its defiance. The conflict is seen less as a definitive end and more as an intermission, with the potential for a continued, clandestine cat-and-mouse game of rebuilding and surveillance, leaving the long-term threat unresolved.</p>
