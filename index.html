          <p>A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 46-year-old woman who was found with stab wounds at a house in Stoke Newington, east London, following a suspected gas explosion. The Met Police and London Fire Brigade responded to reports of a blast with a person trapped inside a terraced house on Dumont Road. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, while the man was taken to hospital with slash wounds that are not life-threatening. The explosion appeared to have blown out a downstairs window of the house. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated his desire for Iran to completely abandon its nuclear program, not just achieve a ceasefire with Israel, while traveling on Air Force One after shortening his G7 summit visit.

Trump predicted that Israel would continue its strikes on Iran and mentioned he would monitor the situation from the White House Situation Room.

          <p>President Trump has signed an order confirming parts of a trade deal between the UK and US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The agreement, reached last month, allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The order also includes a similar system for steel and aluminium, though specific details are yet to be announced, and removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. The UK government has stated it will continue to pursue 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed, while granting a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion litres of US ethanol. </p>

          <p>Israel has claimed responsibility for killing an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general, while in a separate incident, dozens of Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured near a Gaza aid distribution center. According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, Israeli forces attacked civilians heading to the aid site in Khan Younis, though the Israeli army has not yet commented on the incident. Eyewitnesses reported that Israeli drones and tanks fired at the citizens, resulting in a large number of casualties. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), supported by Israel and the US, has been distributing aid as an alternative to UN assistance, which Israel alleges has been misappropriated by Hamas. </p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an appeal to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," ending a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," but the court sided with earlier rulings in Sheeran's favor. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Sheeran, expressed immense relief, stating that the copyright trials had been haunting her for the past 10 years. The court agreed that the chord progression and harmonic rhythms in Gaye's song are too commonplace to be legally protected. </p>

          <p>President Trump's actions and strategy of "masterful ambiguity" in the third round of the Iran-Israel conflict have dominated international and national events. Analysts in Israel believe Trump gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a green light to strike Iran after Iran failed to negotiate the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. Trump has maintained a deliberate ambiguity about his role, offering to mediate peace while warning enemies against harming Americans. The article suggests that Trump's approach has allowed Israel to degrade Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and that Trump is using the situation to message various political objectives. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US immigration system, initially driven by xenophobia and racism, has evolved into a tool for multinational corporations to exploit labor and increase profits. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and subsequent immigration laws have created an imbalance between labor and capital, trapping Mexican workers and giving artificial negotiating advantages to corporations. Taxpayers subsidize the violent border security measures that enforce this system, with the budget for the US Border Patrol increasing dramatically since 1994. Protests reflect a growing sentiment that someone's right to life should not depend on their immigration status or corporate interests. </p>

This move has sparked controversy, with many in the music industry expressing concern over the potential erasure of human creativity and the devaluation of artistic labor.

The executive explained that taking the biggest player from their biggest opponent, even for a short period, did not align with their strategy. They are focusing on reinforcing the team in the traditional transfer window after the tournament. </p>

          <p>British Steel has secured a five-year contract worth Â£500m to supply train tracks for Network Rail, potentially safeguarding the future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The company will provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialist rail products. The contract guarantees work for the plant for at least five years, following government intervention to prevent the closure of blast furnaces. The deal comes ahead of the government's national infrastructure strategy and aims to strengthen domestic manufacturing and supply chains. </p>
