          <p>Tesla announced a 14% year-over-year decline in second-quarter vehicle deliveries, reporting approximately 384,000 units, which was slightly below Wall Street expectations. This marks the second straight quarterly drop for the electric vehicle manufacturer, which faces heightened competition from Chinese EV makers and political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite the decline, the company's production numbers remained relatively stable at over 410,000 vehicles. The report also noted multiple recalls for the Cybertruck and ongoing tensions between Musk and the Trump administration over federal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on transshipped items. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a move Trump suggests will open new opportunities for American products like large vehicles. The agreement aims to curb the practice of transshipping, where countries like China use Vietnam to circumvent U.S. trade barriers. Critics express concern that these tariffs, paid by U.S. importers, could lead to higher prices for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major spending bill passed by the Senate, backed by President Trump, proposes approximately $1.1 trillion in healthcare spending cuts over the next decade, with over $1 trillion coming from Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these changes could cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance by 2034, primarily through new work requirements and restrictions on state provider taxes. Critics argue these cuts will disproportionately harm vulnerable populations and threaten the financial stability of rural hospitals, which heavily rely on Medicaid funding.

This move aims to prevent interference from the Chinese government, which claims authority over the selection of his reincarnation. In his statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader reinforced that the tradition will continue after his death and that his successor should be chosen according to traditional Tibetan Buddhist procedures. Beijing responded by reiterating its stance that the selection must occur within China and receive its approval.</p>

The decision was made based on Australia's Migration Act, which includes character requirements for non-citizens.

States prone to natural disasters are seeing the steepest hikes, with Louisiana facing a 28% increase and California a 21% rise following recent wildfires. Experts attribute the trend to the increasing frequency and severity of weather events, as well as rising home replacement costs. This national trend affects household budgets and is becoming a significant factor in the overall cost of living and homeownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has apologized to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, for mischaracterizing his record. During a radio interview, Gillibrand claimed Mamdani had made "references to global jihad," a comment that drew sharp criticism. In a subsequent phone call, Gillibrand apologized for her tone and for misrepresenting his statements, acknowledging that the attacks on him are unacceptable. The controversy stemmed from a debate over Mamdani's refusal to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada," which he argues has been deliberately misinterpreted by critics.</p>

          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) in July could be a strategic way to secure high returns on savings. By locking in a fixed rate, savers can protect their money from future rate declines that would affect variable-rate accounts. Current CD rates, some exceeding 4.5%, can generate significant, predictable interest on a substantial deposit like $20,000. This approach also provides a stable place for funds while allowing savers time to assess the uncertain economic landscape and plan their next financial moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a meeting with top European Union officials in Brussels, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for China and the EU to join forces against "unilateralism and bullying," a clear criticism aimed at the United States. Wang emphasized that if the two major economies insist on dialogue and cooperation, it would be difficult for confrontational blocs to form. The discussions, which included meetings with the presidents of the European Council and Commission, were intended to set the agenda for an upcoming leadersâ€™ summit and covered contentious issues like China's ties with Russia.</p>

          <p>Maxwell Hairston, a first-round NFL draft pick for the Buffalo Bills, is being sued by a woman who alleges he sexually assaulted her in a university dorm room in 2021. The civil lawsuit, filed in federal court in Kentucky, accuses the 21-year-old cornerback of forcing himself on her after she rejected his advances. The Bills' general manager stated the team was aware of the Title IX investigation conducted by the university before drafting Hairston and, after its own research, felt there was "zero information saying that this actually happened."</p>
