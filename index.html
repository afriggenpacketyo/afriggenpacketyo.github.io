          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a significant restructuring plan that includes laying off 900 non-retail employees in North America and closing underperforming stores. The closures will affect locations in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland, and Austria, part of an effort to improve financial performance after six consecutive quarters of declining sales. CEO Brian Niccol stated the goal is to build a more resilient company, while the Workers United union criticized the decisions for lacking employee input. The company plans to open 80 new stores in the U.K. this year despite the closures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, legal scholar Jonathan Turley contrasts the views of academic and media elites, who increasingly label the U.S. Constitution as "broken," with the patriotism he observed in Grand Lake, Colorado. He argues that while some prominent professors describe the system as a crisis rooted in authoritarianism, most Americans see the Constitution as a unifying gift. Turley suggests this disconnect is not a constitutional crisis but rather a crisis of faith among a specific establishment class. He concludes that the document remains a shared covenant that defines the nation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of used auto retailer CarMax plummeted by over 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company's CEO described the fiscal quarter as "challenging," with overall vehicle sales dropping by 4.1% and net income declining by approximately 28% compared to the previous year. This poor performance sent the stock to its lowest price since March 2020. The results are often viewed as a barometer for the auto retail sector, causing shares of other car retailers to fall as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to some economic analysts, the United States government appears to be adopting an industrial policy playbook similar to China's to bolster key strategic sectors. This shift involves a more interventionist approach to ensure domestic supply capacity for critical industries like defense technology and advanced electronics, including semiconductors and lithium. Experts note that escalating geopolitical tensions are a primary driver for these concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. The move is seen as a realization that market forces alone may not be sufficient to secure national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured highly detailed images of Sagittarius B2, the most active star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy. Located near the galactic center's supermassive black hole, the region is densely packed with stars and cosmic dust. The telescope's infrared instruments pierced through the clouds to reveal young stars and molecularly rich areas, providing new insights into the star formation process. Researchers hope these observations will help explain why star formation is relatively low in the galactic center despite the abundance of gas.</p>

          <p>Youth-led protests in Nepal, fueled by anger over perceived corruption and inequality, have resulted in significant political upheaval, including the resignation of the prime minister. The demonstrations, which turned violent and led to dozens of deaths, were initially sparked by a government social media ban and viral posts showcasing the luxurious lifestyles of the political elite. Young activists, or "Gen Z protesters," are now organizing to form a new political party ahead of the 2026 elections. They aim to replace the established political order with new leadership focused on the country's future.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. were nearly unchanged in August, according to the National Association of Realtors, reflecting the impact of higher mortgage rates.

Limited supply continues to support prices, with the median home price rising 2% year-over-year, marking 26 consecutive months of annual gains. The share of first-time buyers remains historically low, while all-cash purchases are a significant portion of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has placed all agency facilities on higher alert after a deadly shooting at a Dallas field office. The incident, which the FBI is investigating as an "act of targeted violence," left one detainee dead and two others critically wounded. The suspected shooter, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly fired from a nearby rooftop, and recovered rounds contained anti-ICE messages. The attack has been condemned by officials as politically motivated amid a reported 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE officers.</p>

          <p>Newly released architectural renderings provide a more detailed look at the large ballroom currently under construction in the White House's East Wing. The 90,000-square-foot facility, which will have a seated capacity of 650, is a project initiated by the Trump administration. According to the White House, construction costs are being covered by private and corporate donors, with nearly $200 million pledged so far. The new structure will be significantly larger than the main White House building, representing a major addition to the historic presidential residence.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly close to deciding whether to seek a criminal indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent target of President Donald Trump. The potential charges may relate to allegations of lying to Congress in 2020, with the statute of limitations approaching. The situation has drawn scrutiny following the recent replacement of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia with a former personal lawyer for Trump. This development marks a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to investigate perceived political adversaries from past administrations.</p>

The agency was already facing criticism for its slow response, which was also hampered by a new policy requiring the Homeland Security Secretary to personally approve any expenditure over $100,000.

Proponents argue a 64-team format would be a fitting way to mark the tournament's centenary and would be more inclusive, while critics, including UEFA's president, worry it would dilute the competition's quality and strain logistics.

This article provides an overview of current national average CD rates for various terms, while also highlighting that top rates from online banks are significantly higher. It explains that short-term CDs currently offer better yields than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks, consider short-term CDs, and potentially use a laddering strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Machar's recent suspension by President Salva Kiir has effectively dissolved the unity government formed under a 2018 peace deal that ended a devastating civil war. The trial, which has limited media access, is seen by some observers as politically motivated and risks reigniting ethnic tensions between the Dinka and Nuer communities.

A memo told agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices for employees in programs with discretionary funding, particularly those "not consistent with the President's priorities." This move escalates the stakes in the congressional funding dispute and is a departure from past shutdowns where non-essential workers were typically furloughed temporarily.

Critics argue that the administration is prematurely claiming it as an effective autism treatment based on limited and inconclusive research.
