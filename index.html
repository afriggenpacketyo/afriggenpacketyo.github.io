          <p>Two children and one adult were struck by a car outside a preschool at Sunrise Presbyterian Church on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, in what authorities suspect may have been an intentional act.

The suspect fled the scene on foot and is believed to be armed with a knife, prompting an active manhunt with drones and checkpoints.

          <p>Nvidia has criticized Anthropic's stance on U.S. AI chip export restrictions to China, dismissing Anthropic's claims of Chinese smuggling tactics as "tall tales." Anthropic had argued for tighter controls and enforcement, suggesting chips were being smuggled in creative ways to circumvent restrictions. Nvidia maintains that American firms should focus on innovation instead of relying on such claims. The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent China from advancing in AI.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has stated that the BBC's response to his complaint about a Spotlight program concerning the murder of Denis Donaldson was "insulting." Adams is suing the BBC for damages at the High Court in Dublin, alleging that the program and accompanying online article falsely claimed he sanctioned Donaldson's murder in 2006. Adams' lawyers sought an apology and compensation, accusing the BBC of malice and sensationalism, but the BBC rejected these remedies, maintaining that the program was responsible journalism. Adams denies the allegation and claims the BBC has doubled down on the allegations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in the Southern District of Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed to be criminals. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the White House's use of the statute was illegal, stating that the president cannot simply declare an invasion and invoke wartime authority during peacetime. The ruling, prompted by a case involving Venezuelans accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, is limited to the Southern District of Texas but could influence other similar cases.</p>

          <p>Stylist Misa Hylton is reportedly suing Mary J. Blige, her longtime friend, for $5 million, alleging that Blige undermined her business relationship with rapper Vado. Hylton claims Blige withheld Vadoâs completed album to pressure him into leaving Hylton's management company. Hylton's attorney suggests the lawsuit is not solely about the Vado album but stems from a breakdown in communication and friendship. The attorney also mentioned that the current situation with Sean Combs is also impacting the situation, as Hylton is the mother of Combs' son.</p>
