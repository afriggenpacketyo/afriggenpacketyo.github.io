          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed past 45,000 for the first time, buoyed by positive reports from President Trump regarding US-China trade negotiations in Spain. This surge led gains across Asia-Pacific markets, with South Korea's Kospi and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 also rising. The market optimism was further supported by a "framework" deal for TikTok's divestment and an upward trend in US major averages ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are anticipating a potential interest rate cut by the Fed this week, contributing to the generally positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump initially claimed unfamiliarity with the assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, when questioned about the lack of flags at half-staff compared to the tribute for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Trump stated he would have lowered flags if the governor had requested it, despite previously calling Governor Tim Walz "whacked out." This exchange highlighted the administration's perceived selective response to political violence and its tendency to blame the "radical left" for such incidents, while largely overlooking violence against Democrats.</p>

          <p>Kristy Kim, a South Korean immigrant, faced significant hurdles in the U.S. due to lacking a credit score, which she termed being a "credit ghost." After struggling to secure an apartment and an auto loan, she founded TomoCredit, a fintech startup that helps individuals, particularly immigrants, build credit. The company generated over $20 million last year, addressing a systemic inefficiency Kim experienced firsthand. She advocates for early credit education and starting with small, manageable loans to establish a positive credit history, empowering others to navigate the U.S. financial system more effectively.

          <p>A UCLA Equity, Diversity and Inclusion official, Johnathan Perkins, has been placed on investigative leave following social media posts expressing satisfaction and indifference over the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Perkins, who claimed to receive death threats, defended his remarks by stating it is acceptable to feel happy when a "racist who called for your eradication dies." UCLA condemned the celebration of violence, emphasizing that while free expression is a core value, such remarks are unacceptable. This incident highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, institutional values, and public reactions to political violence.</p>

          <p>The US Senate narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, President Trump's pick, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors with a 48-47 vote. Miran, currently chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is the first sitting White House official to join the Fed board since the 1930s, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. He is expected to participate in a crucial Fed policy meeting this week, where a quarter-percentage point rate cut is anticipated. Miran supports Trump's tariffs and stricter immigration policies, aligning with the president's push for significant interest rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that nearly one in four NHS dementia service staff feel unable to provide optimal care, and fewer than a third believe current diagnostic processes are adequate. Alzheimer’s Research UK highlights that over a third of the estimated 982,000 people with dementia in the UK lack a formal diagnosis, with many waiting over a year for help. Carers describe the process as devastating due to lack of answers and support. The charity is advocating for GP referrals to specialists within six weeks and diagnosis/treatment plans within 18 weeks to address these systemic failures.</p>

In an interview, Zelenskyy expressed frustration with Western powers for not increasing pressure on the Kremlin, arguing Trump's previous summit with Putin was a mistake that led to "de-isolation." He believes the U.S. is strong enough to impose robust sanctions and provide air defense systems, asserting that Trump has the "force to make Putin afraid of him."</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that U.S. companies shift from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, arguing it would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed it is actively reviewing this proposal. Supporters, including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, have previously advocated for ending quarterly guidance, citing its focus on short-term profits. While current regulations require quarterly reports, a change could be implemented by the SEC, where Republicans hold a majority, potentially aligning U.S. practices more with the UK and EU.

The fluorescent dye, released in batches, will be tracked by monitors to gather crucial data.

          <p>President Trump criticized the NFL's new "dynamic kickoff rule" as "sissy" football, sparking commentary from a public humanities professor who deemed the language "derogatory" and reflective of "toxic masculinity." The NFL implemented the rule to improve player safety and increase returns, moving kickoffs and placing players closer together. Professor Deepak Sarma argues Trump's use of "sissy" belittles men not fitting hyper-masculine ideals and insults women, highlighting a "disturbing" trend of normalized abuse and discrimination online.

This period, marked by the US giving Beijing a "hall pass" on Ukraine and a potential China-India reset, positions China to potentially reshape global trade and development.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" deal with China that could prevent a nationwide ban on TikTok, which was mandated by Congress for January 2025. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed a "basic consensus" has been reached, requiring TikTok's sale to a US-based owner. Concerns about Chinese influence, potential data access, and propaganda spread through the app prompted the initial ban efforts. President Trump is scheduled to discuss the final terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, highlighting the political sensitivity of TikTok's massive user base, particularly among young voters.</p>

Critics question the "obscene" amount and the board's reverential stance, especially given Musk's volatile behavior and recent acknowledgment of "rough quarters" for Tesla's core EV business. The proposal underscores the board's belief that Musk's presence is essential to Tesla's valuation, despite risks. (not investment advice)</p>
