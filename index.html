        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of corporate bankruptcies in Japan increased by 5.7 percent in April compared to the previous year, reaching 828 cases, which is the highest level in 11 years for the month. The increase is attributed to businesses struggling with labor shortages and funding difficulties due to elevated prices. Bankruptcies related to manpower shortages reached a record high of 36 for April, while those related to rising prices stood at 56. This reflects the economic challenges faced by Japanese businesses in the current environment.</p>

The proposal includes new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats argue will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate suggests the proposals would reduce health care coverage for 8.6 million people over the next decade. While Republicans claim they are eliminating waste and abuse, Democrats criticize the cuts as an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>

          <p>Former members of UK Special Forces have broken their silence to provide eyewitness accounts of alleged war crimes committed by colleagues in Iraq and Afghanistan. Veterans described seeing members of the SAS murder unarmed people in their sleep and execute handcuffed detainees, including children. The new testimony includes allegations of war crimes stretching over more than a decade, implicating the SBS for the first time in executions of unarmed and wounded individuals. The Ministry of Defence stated its commitment to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the Japanese temple. The return follows a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, ending a legal battle initiated by a South Korean temple claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The artifact is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion, primarily from Medicaid, to fund tax breaks, triggering a major political fight over health care. The proposal includes new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats argue will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate indicates the proposals could reduce health care coverage for 8.6 million people over the next decade. While Republicans claim they are eliminating waste and abuse, Democrats criticize the cuts as an attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act.</p>

          <p>Diplomats and experts from India and Pakistan believe the recent US-brokered ceasefire over Kashmir, while welcome, may not lead to long-term peace. Both sides needed a ceasefire but were hesitant to request it first, and the US played a crucial role in facilitating the agreement. Analysts suggest the ceasefire is likely to hold in the short term due to international pressure and the recognition of the costs of escalation. However, long-term challenges, including terrorism and water security, remain, and the situation remains fragile.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. These measures are seen as a response to the surge of Reform UK in recent local elections. Migrants will need to "earn the right to stay" and demonstrate their commitment to British society, according to government statements. Critics question the effectiveness of the plans and raise concerns about the lack of a cap on numbers, while supporters argue they will ensure a fairer system.</p>
