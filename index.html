          <p>A new congressional map proposed by Texas Republicans could significantly alter the state's political landscape by adding up to five GOP seats. The plan has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, as it would redraw district lines in major cities like Dallas and Houston, potentially forcing incumbents into primary battles. Notably, the proposed map would move the home of Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett out of her current district, an action she and other party leaders have decried as a partisan power grab designed to silence voters.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman has been arrested in New Zealand after a two-year-old girl was found inside her suitcase in the luggage compartment of a bus. The driver became suspicious after noticing the bag moving and discovered the child, who was reportedly very hot but otherwise physically unharmed. The girl was taken to a hospital for medical assessment, and the woman faces charges of ill-treatment and neglect of a child. Police commended the bus driver for his immediate action, which likely prevented a more tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with payouts expected to be less than £950 per person. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, deemed exceptionally large commissions unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator advised affected consumers to contact their loan providers directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a wave of new spicy menu items in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are using spicy sauces and limited-time offers as a low-cost strategy to generate buzz and drive sales amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests frequently go viral, creating a powerful marketing cycle for these new products.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and a prominent ally of Donald Trump, to the position of U.S. attorney for Washington D.C. The confirmation passed on a party-line vote of 50-45. Pirro, who previously served as a district attorney and judge in New York, has been a controversial figure for promoting baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Her appointment has been praised by Republicans as bringing a "warrior for law and order" to the role, while Democrats have criticized her for what they describe as "blind obedience" to Trump.</p>

          <p>A volcano in Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in what scientists believe to be several hundred years.

According to officials, the ash cloud spread eastward over the Pacific Ocean without affecting any populated areas. The Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team stated that while the initial activity is decreasing, moderate explosive activity could continue.</p>

The museum faced public criticism after a placard detailing the impeachments was removed from its National Museum for American History. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any political pressure from the Trump administration, explaining the temporary placard was removed because it did not meet museum standards for presentation. The original label was part of a section on the limits of presidential power.</p>

          <p>New footage released by Chinese state media appears to show the country's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducting its first test of an electromagnetic catapult system. The successful launch of an aircraft marks a significant milestone for the vessel, which is the first in China's fleet to be equipped with this modern technology, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy. The drill indicates that the Fujian is progressing through its sea trials ahead of its expected entry into service with the People's Liberation Army Navy later this year.</p>

          <p>A series of unusual public appearances and rambling remarks by President Donald Trump has renewed questions among some mental health experts about his cognitive fitness. The article points to instances of the president drifting off-topic, making factually incorrect claims, and exhibiting what some psychologists describe as confabulation and deteriorating verbal coherence. While the White House and its allies aggressively defend the president's sharpness, critics argue his behavior warrants the same level of scrutiny that was applied to his predecessor. The piece highlights a growing debate over the 79-year-old president's fitness for office.</p>
