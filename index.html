        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals a significant increase in complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England, with complaints now five times higher than five years ago. The Housing Ombudsman attributes this rise to an imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, coupled with issues such as asbestos, electrical hazards, pest control, and leaks. The report underscores a breakdown in trust due to the poor condition of social housing and delays in repairs, potentially leading to social unrest. The ombudsman calls for a transformative overhaul, including independent funding review and a national tenant body, to address the systemic issues and improve tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC rates will likely remain stable in June, despite a slight decrease in inflation. While the Federal Reserve is considering potential rate cuts, economic uncertainties, including tariffs, may prevent any immediate changes. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, while HELOC rates adjust monthly based on the prime rate, and for June, both are expected to remain consistent. Borrowers should still compare rates and terms from various lenders, and be comfortable with the total borrowing amount and monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), located in New York City, focuses on resolving disputes related to international trade, serving as the main judicial forum for civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. The CIT was established in 1980 and operates under Article III of the Constitution, with nine judges appointed for life. Recently, a three-judge panel of the CIT ruled against President Trump's sweeping tariffs, asserting that he exceeded his legal authority, although this decision is being appealed. The court interprets U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930, to resolve trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to President Trump, expressed confidence that the court ruling against the administration's tariffs will be overturned on appeal. Hassett believes the tariffs are legal and necessary to ensure fair trade, combating barriers against American goods abroad and stemming the flow of fentanyl across the U.S. border. He criticized the judges as "activist judges" trying to slow down important negotiations, and stated that the administration will continue its anti-fentanyl efforts. While acknowledging other trade law options exist, the administration plans to appeal the ruling, confident it is incorrect.</p>

          <p>Astronomers searching for the elusive "Planet Nine" have instead discovered a new dwarf planet, named 2017 OF201, in the outer reaches of the solar system. The object, about 430 miles across, is located three times farther from Earth than Neptune and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years to complete. The discovery challenges the Planet Nine theory, as the dwarf planet's orbit does not follow the clustered trend of other objects in the Kuiper Belt. While the Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to shed more light on the mystery, the discovery highlights the potential for open science and the use of archival data in making significant astronomical findings.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling blocking President Trump's tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. While the UK has a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, this agreement is not yet in effect. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods like salmon and whisky, creating uncertainty about the tariff deal's future. The UK government is working to implement the deal swiftly, but the potential for the White House to appeal or impose tariffs through other mechanisms casts doubt on the deal's benefits for the UK.</p>

A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without following legal procedure.

          <p>Following a U.S. court ruling that President Trump exceeded his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is expected to explore alternative legal avenues. Goldman Sachs economists suggest potential options include Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. While an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible, the administration may quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Section 122, although this would only last for 150 days without congressional action. The ruling has increased uncertainty, but the Trump administration is expected to find other ways to impose tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the scope of environmental impact statements, ruling in favor of developers and stating that these statements have been used too often to delay or block new projects. The justices unanimously decided for the developers of a proposed 88-mile railroad in Utah, which could carry crude oil to refineries along the Gulf Coast. Justice Kavanaugh said that procedural law has given judges and environmentalists too much authority to hinder development, resulting in fewer projects being completed and increased costs.</p>

          <p>An op-ed criticizes Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips have backfired, arguing that these controls serve U.S. national security interests by preventing the fueling of China's military rise. The author contends that China's efforts to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers predate the 2022 restrictions and that the U.S. cannot afford to provide advanced chips that power the People's Liberation Army's modernization. The author suggests Nvidia should focus on competing globally rather than lamenting its diminishing market share in China, especially after the rescission of the AI diffusion rule. The author concludes that U.S. semiconductor policy should prioritize national security over corporate profits.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. federal court's decision to block a set of across-the-board tariffs, trade experts and America's trading partners have reacted with caution, not celebration. While stocks rose internationally, economists pointed out that President Trump could pursue other legal routes to enact tariffs. The court decision offers a fragile chance at reprieve for economies like those of Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union, and India, but it also guarantees continued chaos. The ruling gives the administration 10 days to halt the collection of tariffs, but the administration could quickly replace the 10 percent tariffs with a tariff of up to 15 percent for 150 days using another trade rule.</p>
