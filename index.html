          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from his own supporters regarding the handling of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Critics, including some far-right figures, have accused Bondi of withholding key information after a Justice Department memo stated there was no incriminating client list. The situation has reportedly caused a rift between the Justice Department and the FBI, with Trump urging his base to let Bondi work and to move on from the Epstein case, expressing frustration with the continued public focus on the matter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA has reached an agreement with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods to protect players from injury and burnout. The consensus includes a minimum 72-hour gap between matches and a three-week rest period at the end of each season. This decision follows a lawsuit filed by Fifpro over concerns about an expanded fixture calendar, particularly the new 32-team Club World Cup. While FIFA has conceded on rest periods, the governing body remains committed to creating more global competitions to provide opportunities for players worldwide.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has called for the NCAA to enforce stricter rules on college football uniforms, similar to the NFL's system of fines. Speaking at Big 12 Media Days, Sanders expressed his disapproval of players wearing minimal gear, such as biker shorts and no knee pads, arguing it shows a lack of respect for the game. He suggested that financial penalties should be implemented for uniform violations. Sanders, who recently signed a five-year extension with Colorado, also addressed questions about his health, insisting he is well and focused on his team.</p>

          <p>US media reports reveal that numerous buildings at Camp Mystic, where 27 children died in recent Texas floods, were removed from official high-risk flood maps years prior. According to records, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had designated the camp as a high-risk area in 2011, but the camp successfully appealed the designation. This has raised serious questions about regulatory oversight and safety protocols at the riverside location. The devastating floods have claimed at least 129 lives across Texas, with rescue and recovery efforts still ongoing amid the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A government official in Spain has stated that recent violent clashes between migrants and residents in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco were fueled by far-right groups on social media. The unrest, which resulted in five minor injuries and one arrest, reportedly followed an assault on an elderly man by unknown assailants. Authorities detected online posts inciting a "hunt for migrants," leading to groups armed with batons roaming the streets. Officials have appealed for calm, noting that migrants constitute about 30% of the town's population, many of whom are essential farm laborers.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is bolstering its security protocols with new technology. The agency is deploying a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial reconnaissance and inter-agency communication. These upgrades are a direct response to failures identified during the 2024 incident, where a shooter used a commercial drone for surveillance and communication gaps existed with local police.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is set to begin withholding up to 50% of monthly benefits for recipients who have been overpaid and have not established a repayment plan. This new phase in the agency's effort to recover billions in accidental overpayments is expected to start in late July 2025. The SSA reportedly attempted to reclaim funds from approximately 2 million people in the last fiscal year. The article outlines the process, repayment options, and how affected individuals can request a waiver if the overpayment was not their fault and repayment would cause hardship.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has dropped all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines. Moore was indicted in 2023 for allegedly running a scheme to provide fake vaccination cards and administer saline shots to children instead of actual vaccines. Bondi stated that Moore gave patients a choice when the government did not. The decision was praised by figures like Rep.

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must adopt a "self-centred" approach and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power.

According to Zheng, this shift is necessary to accurately explain China's practices to the world and to better anticipate the nation's future development. This perspective highlights a strategic push within China to shape its own global narrative.</p>
