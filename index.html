            <h2>Post Office Scandal Victim Feels Shortchanged Despite Increased Compensation Offer</h2>

            <p>Betty Brown, a 92-year-old victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal, expresses dissatisfaction with the latest compensation offer, despite it being increased to 60% of her claim. Brown was forced out of her sub-postmistress position in 2003 after faulty software made it appear that money was missing, leading to significant financial losses. While she acknowledges the efforts of Post Office minister Gareth Thomas, she insists that justice is still being denied after 26 years of waiting. The scandal, involving over 900 sub-postmasters wrongfully accused of theft, continues to face criticism for slow compensation payouts.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, exceeding economists' predictions of 0.1%, driven by strong performance in the services and manufacturing sectors. Computer programming, telecoms, and car dealerships contributed to the growth in services, while manufacturing, electronics, and pharmaceuticals also performed well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the positive figures but stressed the need for further action to stimulate economic growth. However, analysts warn that the impact of new tariffs on goods being imported to the US and upcoming tax rises could curtail this growth in the near future.</p>

            <p>A new drug called capivasertib has been approved for use on the NHS in England, offering a new treatment option for women with advanced breast cancer. Clinical trials have demonstrated that capivasertib can slow the progression of the disease and shrink tumors in some patients. The drug, suitable for those with certain gene mutations, works by blocking the activity of a protein molecule that drives cancer growth. Patients report improved quality of life and the potential to delay chemotherapy. The approval has been hailed as a significant step forward in breast cancer treatment, but some are calling for faster approval processes for such drugs.</p>

            <p>Economists believe China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its yuan to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs due to concerns about triggering financial market instability. A rapid depreciation could weaken consumer confidence and lead to capital outflows, something policymakers are keen to avoid. Instead, the central bank is expected to engineer an orderly and gradual depreciation. Analysts suggest that devaluation is no longer an effective trade weapon, and maintaining stability is a higher priority for Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national, in a prisoner swap arranged by the CIA and FSB. Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason after donating to a Ukrainian humanitarian group. The swap, conducted in Abu Dhabi, involved the release of Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus at the request of U.S. authorities. The CIA played a key role in the negotiations, highlighting the importance of maintaining communication with Russia despite bilateral challenges. The move underscores ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow.</p>

            <p>Danish shoppers are boycotting U.S. products in response to President Trump's trade tariffs and his interest in Greenland. Supermarket chains are labeling European-owned brands to help consumers avoid American products. Travelers are also increasingly avoiding trips to the U.S. amid trade policies and unfavorable currency fluctuations. While some believe the boycott may be short-lived, it reflects a wider shift in consumer sentiment and growing tensions between Denmark and the U.S.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's policies are driving foreign students away from the US and towards Britain, as evidenced by stories told at a US universities conference in San Diego. Foreign students face deportation for minor infractions, and many have had their visas revoked. Jo Johnson suggests that the UK should welcome these students as they bring economic benefits and fill workforce needs. The cabinet is currently grappling with conflicting objectives regarding immigration numbers, but attracting foreign students should be a priority.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's trade plan aimed to achieve better trade deals, boost American industry, confront China, raise revenue, and lower prices for US consumers. While some progress has been made in initiating trade negotiations, the president's on-again, off-again tariff moves create instability. A trade war with China carries significant risks, and new tariffs could drive up consumer prices. Despite potential revenue gains, the overall impact on the economy remains uncertain, with the potential for negative consequences for both political standing and future electoral prospects.</p>

            <p>Alexander Hurst discusses the lessons Europe can learn from Donald Trump's tariff policy, highlighting that Trump backs down under pressure. He notes that the rest of the world is ready to bypass the US's chaos and unpredictability, urging Europe to be the alternative. The EU must shore up its greatest weakness: its dependence on fossil-fuel imports. Hurst advocates for a green re-industrialization, designing and building renewables in Europe to replace fossil fuels.</p>

Garcia's lawyer expects the U.S. to facilitate his immediate release and return, while the Justice Department asserts the President's exclusive prerogative in foreign affairs.</p>
