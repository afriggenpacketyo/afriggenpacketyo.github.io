          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is not expected to significantly impact the U.S. mainland, but models show several potential paths, including over Haiti, Cuba, or toward Central America. The storm is producing winds up to 45 miles per hour, and its path remains uncertain, with possibilities including a northward turn, westward drift, or a combination of both, potentially affecting Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba should prepare for heavy rain, strong winds, flooding, and rough surf, with the storm expected to slow down over the central Caribbean Sea. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <h2>Most Americans Plan to Claim Social Security Before Age 70</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Schroders indicates that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before age 70, despite financial advice suggesting that waiting until 70 results in higher monthly payments. Claiming early reduces monthly payments by about 30%, while delaying until 70 provides a more than 30% boost, but many Americans need the income immediately upon retiring. Concerns about the future of Social Security also influence the decision to claim early, with worries that the money may not be available later. Social Security faces a financial crunch, potentially leading to benefit reductions by 2034, but lawmakers could address the issue by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes (not investment advice). Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Cattle ranchers in the U.S. are worried about the potential comeback of the screwworm, a parasitic fly, and President Trump's talk of importing beef from Argentina. The screwworm, eradicated in the U.S. in 1966, has reappeared in Mexico, leading to border closures for live cattle imports. Ranchers are concerned that the sterile fly production facility needed to combat the spread is still years away. Ranchers are facing drought conditions and dwindling incentives to increase herd sizes, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association urges Trump and Congress to allow the market to work without intervention (not investment advice). Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Lindsay Sandiford, a British grandmother sentenced to death in Indonesia for drug smuggling, will be allowed to return to the UK. Sandiford was convicted in 2013 after nearly five kilos of cocaine were found in her suitcase, but she claimed she was threatened by a drug syndicate. An agreement between the Indonesian and British governments will facilitate her transfer, along with another British prisoner, Shahab Shahabadi. Both prisoners are reportedly suffering from health problems, and Indonesia and the UK do not have a formal prisoner transfer arrangement. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson anticipates that the company's earnings next year will surpass its 2025 results, which have exceeded Wall Street's expectations. GM's shares rose following the announcement, with Jacobson noting that the company will continue to repurchase shares. The automaker's top priority is returning adjusted profit margins in North America to 8% to 10%, though a timeline for meeting this goal was not specified. GM's updated 2025 guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion (not investment advice).

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is expected to peak tonight, offering a chance to see bright and fast-moving meteors.

The meteors originate from Halley's Comet and can appear faint but leave a distinctive light trail, with larger meteors producing bright trails called fireballs. For the best viewing conditions, find a dark spot away from city lights after midnight with an unobstructed wide, open sky, and the lack of moonlight will improve visibility.

          <p>Japan's parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the country's first female prime minister, as fellow lawmakers select the ultraconservative. Takaichi replaces Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the Liberal Democratic Party's disastrous election loss in July. Her win points Japan to the right, including on immigration and social issues, and she faces public anger over rising prices. Takaichi is expected to emulate Abe's policies including a stronger military and economy, as well as revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Tips for Seniors to Prepare for Medical Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 09:34:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts provide four ways seniors can prepare for surprise medical costs, including understanding Medicare coverage, building medical emergency funds, reviewing supplemental coverage, and planning for long-term care costs. It's important to learn what Medicare does and doesn't cover, as it typically doesn't cover long-term care, physical checkups, eye exams, dental care, and hearing aids. A dedicated medical emergency fund can help protect your finances in retirement, and supplemental coverage can help you pay for costs that Medicare alone won't cover. It's also important to save for long-term care, which can potentially costs thousands of dollars each month (not investment advice). Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Daily life under soaring inflation, rising unemployment and vanishing opportunities has become a relentless struggle for many young Iranians. Across cities and towns in Iran, the younger generation faces a reality where dreams are deferred, voices are silenced and the future grows more uncertain. Some estimates show 80% of Iranian households earn below the global poverty line, and the recent return of UN sanctions over Iran's nuclear weapons program has added to growing global pressure on Tehran. Years of political repression, economic hardship and social restrictions have pushed many young Iranians to leave the country. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>A document showing the lease agreement between Prince Andrew and the Crown Estate for his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, has emerged. Andrew has only ever paid a token annual rent because the arrangement with the Crown Estate landlords struck in 2003 meant that, instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments up-front, including for renovations. The deal was based on a notional rent of £260,000 per year, which meant his initial payments represented about 33 years of rent up to 2036. The lease shows he does have to keep paying for the upkeep of the house, ensuring the exterior stonework is in good condition every five years and painting the interior every seven years.

More than 80% of patients at trial sites across the United States, Germany, UK, Netherlands and Italy showed significant improvement in central vision following a year of monitoring.

He repeated an apology made previously for things the government got wrong, but said he was proud of what teachers and schools did to cope with the "unbelievably difficult" circumstances. Johnson said the lockdown and social distancing rules "probably did go too far", and that children could have been exempted from them.

          <p>Tech CEOs are making ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities, but some software engineers are skeptical. While AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers, many engineers share experiences of untangling AI-generated code or feeling pressure to use AI regardless of need. AI cannot think through higher level problem solving like engineers do, and the productivity bump from using AI depends on choosing appropriate uses and having relevant expertise. There are concerns about employers replacing junior coders with AI, cutting off the long-term talent supply needed to supervise the machines in the years to come. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>States are warning that struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries may miss out on benefits come November if the government shutdown continues. The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a letter to state agencies saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be "insufficient funds" to pay full November SNAP benefits. The USDA said in its Lapse of Funding plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.
