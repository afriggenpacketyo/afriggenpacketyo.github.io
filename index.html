          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open with a dominant performance, finishing four strokes ahead of the competition at Royal Portrush. This victory marks Scheffler's second major tournament win of 2025 and his 11th PGA tour win since 2024, further solidifying his position as the world's number one player. The win places him among an elite group of golfers to win three of the four majors before age 30, leaving only the U.S. Open to complete the coveted career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>A tense, temporary ceasefire is being observed in southern Syria following a week of deadly sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin communities. Bedouin fighters, who have retreated from the city of Suweida, are demanding the release of their injured members, whom they consider hostages, and have not ruled out a return to hostilities. The violence, which has killed over 1,120 people and displaced at least 128,000, erupted from long-running tensions and has drawn in government forces and Israeli air strikes.</p>
