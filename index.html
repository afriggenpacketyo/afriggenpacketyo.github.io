          <p>The Dalai Lama celebrated his 90th birthday in Dharamshala, India, surrounded by thousands of followers and international dignitaries. During the week's events, the Tibetan spiritual leader confirmed his intention to reincarnate, ending speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. He expressed hope to live for many more years, while China maintains it has the sole authority to approve his successor. The celebration highlighted his global influence as a symbol of peace and Tibetan resistance.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, UK, voiced his frustration after a man who brazenly stole beer from his store faced minimal consequences. The offender was handled with a community resolution, only requiring him to pay for the stolen goods and accept a ban from the shop, avoiding a criminal record. The shop owner argues this approach fails to deter repeat offenses, reflecting a national trend where a low percentage of reported shoplifting incidents lead to charges. This issue has prompted the home secretary to announce a new crackdown on town centre crime.</p>

          <p>Germany is witnessing a significant decline in its monastic communities, with dozens of monasteries and convents closing annually due to a sharp drop in membership. The number of nuns has plummeted from over 93,000 in 1960 to under 10,000 today, forcing orders to sell historic properties, like the St. Erentraud's Abbey. Experts attribute the trend to the church's diminishing influence and expanded opportunities for women in secular society. This shift has broader societal impacts, as religious orders hand over control of schools and hospitals they have long operated.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are bracing for a volatile week, centered on two key events. The first is the July 9 deadline for U.S.-European Union trade negotiations, with the possibility of new tariffs looming, although a full deal is considered impossible. The second major event is the OPEC International Seminar in Vienna, where oil producers will discuss energy security and investment. This is followed by an OPEC+ meeting to decide on a potential oil output hike amidst fluctuating crude prices, setting the stage for significant market movements. (not investment advice)</p>

This assertion comes ahead of Monica's trial, where prosecutors allege she conspired with Baker to commit the murder.

          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers has found that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This state of balance is known to be vital for the brain's information processing capabilities and overall mental ability. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research establishes a link between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting they share a common genetic foundation. These findings define brain criticality as a biological phenotype, opening new avenues for understanding brain function and disorders.</p>

The case stems from the Security Service repeatedly lying to courts about its relationship with a violent neo-Nazi informant who abused women. MI5 had claimed its false statements were due to mistakes and memory lapses, but newly revealed secret material shows a more deliberate effort to mislead. The court found that MI5 continued to provide misleading evidence even during the inquiries, withholding key information that undermined its own conclusions about the initial failures.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant but brief pitching performance, throwing two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the second. However, his strong start was not enough as the Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Houston Astros 6-4. Long reliever Justin Wrobleski struggled, giving up five runs and allowing the Astros to take a lead the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome. Despite a homer from Mookie Betts and a two-RBI day for Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers stranded multiple runners, clinching a series loss and highlighting their continued reliance on a yet-to-be-fully-healthy pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Recently enacted regulations for the Chinese Communist Party suggest that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more decision-making power to his deputies. The new rules aim to standardize the work of central commissions and leading groups, many of which were established or empowered under Xi's leadership. According to state media, these bodies are now tasked with "planning, discussing and checking on major matters," a shift in responsibility. One analyst noted that this move could be interpreted as part of a long-term plan for his eventual succession, by formalizing policy processes at the highest levels.</p>
