          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee is facing federal charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction after she allegedly directed an undocumented Mexican man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, out of her courtroom to avoid ICE agents. The indictment follows her arrest in April, drawing criticism from Democratic leaders who argue it undermines judicial independence. Dugan's lawyers are seeking to dismiss the charges, asserting that her actions were protected by judicial immunity, as she believed ICE needed a judicial warrant to arrest Flores-Ruiz within the courthouse. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has suspended Judge Dugan from her position while the case proceeds, raising concerns about the impact on future immigration cases and the willingness of undocumented individuals to participate in the legal system.</p>

The company, based in Israel, priced its shares above the expected range, indicating strong investor interest. This IPO is being closely watched as a potential indicator of renewed enthusiasm for IPOs after a period of market hesitancy, and eToro's financial performance has been strong, with net income increasing thirteenfold in the past year. The company has also seen substantial growth in its cryptocurrency business, although crypto assets are expected to account for a slightly smaller portion of its trading commission in the upcoming quarter.

          <p>Israeli strikes have resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties in northern Gaza, prompting Israel to issue evacuation orders for residents in parts of Gaza City. The Israeli military claims to be targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants while attempting to minimize civilian harm, though Palestinian health officials report dozens of deaths, including children. The escalating conflict has raised international concerns, with the Trump administration seeking to broker an end to the 18-month war, and the Israeli military has called up thousands of additional soldiers to bolster the war effort. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened further escalation unless Hamas releases all hostages, while Hamas refuses to disarm or release hostages until Israel withdraws from Gaza.</p>

          <p>The government of England and Wales will release over a thousand inmates early to alleviate severe overcrowding in prisons, as announced by the Justice Secretary. This measure will apply to offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licenses, who will now be released after 28 days, and the government faces a shortage of prison spaces for male offenders by November. While the government plans to invest £4.7 billion in new prisons, these will not be sufficient to resolve the crisis, and the interim permanent secretary said that England would run out of prison places for adult men by November of this year.</p>

Gabbard's decision is seen as an effort to consolidate control over intelligence functions, though critics worry it could reduce oversight and create inefficiencies, and the relocation also involves moving the National Intelligence Council to Gabbard's headquarters.</p>

The administration claims Harvard has failed to confront race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus, while the university insists it is compliant with federal law, and Harvard filed a lawsuit in April to challenge the funding freeze.</p>

Salonen's performances, including a tribute to Pierre Boulez, have been met with enthusiasm from audiences and musicians. With Gustavo Dudamel leaving the L.A. Phil at the end of next season, the orchestra may be without a music director for a couple of years, and Salonen's return could provide guidance during the transition. While Salonen has expressed a desire for a break from institutional demands, his history with the L.A. Phil and the unique venue of Disney Hall make a return a possibility.</p>

          <p>A new study by Australian podiatrists examines the correlation between Barbie's foot posture and her social standing, revealing that the doll's feet have evolved over time from arched to flat, reflecting changing social roles. The researchers analyzed 2,750 dolls produced from 1959 to 2024, finding that employed dolls are more likely to have flat feet, while fashion-focused dolls are more likely to have arched feet. Mattel confirmed that foot design was a deliberate part of Barbie's evolution, with reimagined footwear options supporting Barbie's bold steps forward, and the study also explores the reputation of high heels in society.</p>

          <p>Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born Georgia woman, faces deportation despite the dismissal of traffic charges that led to her arrest by ICE. Cristobal, who has lived in the U.S. since she was 4, was detained after a traffic stop, and despite the charges being dropped, ICE continues to pursue her deportation, along with her father. The Trump administration's expanded deportation policies have led to the arrest of individuals like Cristobal, who has no criminal record, and her case has sparked unease in her community, even among conservative voters.</p>

          <p>US drug overdose deaths fell 27% in 2024, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, with an estimated 80,000 deaths compared to 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the reduction to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money. Despite the significant drop, annual overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, and some worry that recent declines could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce.</p>

The full House vote may come as early as next week, but the legislation could see significant changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Republicans are again targeting Medicaid, proposing changes that include work requirements for enrollees and curtailing taxes levied on providers. The GOP argues that the program is broken and costs too much, while experts suggest that the effort faces greater challenges than in 2017 due to increased enrollment and public support for Medicaid. The proposed changes could cause millions to lose their health coverage, with a focus on offsetting the cost of extending tax cuts passed in 2017.</p>

Chinese companies like Shein and Temu, which built their businesses around the loophole, may face challenges as a result of the higher prices, and the tariffs are also disrupting the economics of global trade.</p>
