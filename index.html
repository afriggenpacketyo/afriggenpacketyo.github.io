          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, has announced new content restrictions for users under 18, aligning the platform's content with PG-13 movie ratings to ensure age-appropriate content. These automatic protections, set to be fully implemented by year-end, will block teen accounts from seeing search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent them from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. Additionally, Meta is integrating these regulations into its AI technology and offering parents an optional "Limited Content" setting for a more restrictive experience. This initiative aims to reassure parents about showing teens safe, age-appropriate content by default, while also giving them more control over their children's online interactions.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Elise Stefanik and Sen. Tom Cotton, are pressing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to investigate the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). They allege that CAIR's historical ties, public rhetoric, and activism raise questions about whether the group's support for Hamas amounts to material support for terrorism, especially amidst a Gaza ceasefire. CAIR, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has consistently denied these claims, labeling them "false and Islamophobic." The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control has the authority to investigate such matters, ensuring no U.S. assets are used to advance the objectives of terrorist organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza has held, facilitating the return of living Israeli hostages and some deceased, alongside the release of Palestinian detainees. However, the agreement faces challenges as humanitarian organizations urge Israel to open all border crossings for vital aid, which remains insufficient for the devastated region. A significant sticking point is Hamas's failure to return all 24 deceased Israeli hostages, prompting strong warnings from Israeli officials and calls for the deal's suspension from hostage families. The complex situation underscores the immense work required to build trust and rebuild Gaza, even as international leaders welcome the initial steps toward peace.</p>

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department responded to the scene near 124th Street East and Pearblossom Highway on Sunday afternoon. While further details regarding the extent of the remains or the circumstances of the death are currently unavailable, this unsettling discovery has initiated a thorough police investigation. Law enforcement will now work to identify the individual and determine the cause and manner of death, which could involve forensic analysis and searching for missing persons records.</p>

          <h2>US Revokes Six Visas Over Social Media Comments Celebrating Charlie Kirk's Assassination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 20:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department revoked six visas belonging to citizens from various countries, including Argentina and Germany, due to social media comments celebrating the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The department stated it has "no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans" and would remove those who "celebrate the assassination of our citizens." This action follows President Trump posthumously awarding Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, where he condemned "radical left violence." The administration continues to identify visa holders who celebrated Kirk's death, reinforcing its crackdown on immigration and "anti-American activity."</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown enters its third week, the Trump administration is actively seeking alternative methods to ensure federal law enforcement officers are paid, as they are considered "essential" and must report for duty without pay. President Trump has already directed the Pentagon to use existing funds to pay military personnel. Separately, Homeland Security found an an "innovative" way to pay Coast Guard members, and tariff revenue will fund the WIC food program. While these efforts aim to mitigate the shutdown's impact, the National WIC Association warns that such measures are not permanent solutions, highlighting the ongoing financial strain on hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>

The names were released during a news briefing, with authorities emphasizing the profound impact on the close-knit community and the need to support the victims' families. The cause of the explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), a plant specializing in explosives, remains unclear and is currently under investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. This tragic event, which left no survivors, has deeply affected the town of Bucksnort, with victims including a teacher, a local pastor, and many long-time residents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50% on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets, housewares, and lumber, have taken effect, likely increasing costs for consumers. While the administration claims foreign exporters bear the costs, economists, including Goldman Sachs, estimate Americans will absorb about 55% of these additional expenses, with businesses taking 22%. President Trump asserts these duties will boost American manufacturing and federal revenue, with White House officials citing companies shifting production to the U.S. However, the International Monetary Fund warns the full economic impact may not be felt immediately, and recent data already show rising prices for imported home goods.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration plans to release a list of "Democrat programs" targeted for permanent closure due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. This declaration followed the Senate's eighth failed attempt to pass legislation to end the impasse.

The Department of Justice has already reported 4,108 federal workers laid off, with the dismissals expected to disrupt government operations, including critical disease outbreak investigations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Armenia in a World Cup qualifier after Armenia's captain, Tigran Barseghyan, was dismissed for headbutting Irish midfielder Finn Azaz. The incident, occurring seven minutes into the second half, was described by Azaz as Barseghyan "losing his head" and proved to be the turning point in the physical game. Evan Ferguson scored the decisive goal for Ireland, earning their first win in the qualifying campaign. This result moves Ireland to third in Group F, intensifying their battle for a play-off spot with two games remaining, including a significant upcoming match against Portugal.</p>

          <p>Up to 31,000 Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers in California and Hawaii, including nurses, pharmacists, and therapists, began a five-day strike demanding increased salaries and solutions to severe staffing shortages. The United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP) seeks a 25% wage increase over four years, arguing current wages haven't kept pace with inflation and staffing levels are exhausting. Kaiser Permanente calls the strike "unnecessary and disruptive," offering a 21.5% raise and stating current staffing meets or exceeds mandates. The company has hired 7,600 temporary staff to mitigate disruptions, highlighting the deep divide in negotiations.</p>

CEO Sam Altman, recognizing that processing power dictates capability, announced a partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators for its models, aiming for deployment by late 2026. This move, akin to Apple's M-series chips, gives OpenAI deeper control over its technology stack. Additionally, the acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, signals a push into AI-native devices, with OpenAI assembling a complete AI platform to dominate the market and make its models harder to replace.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has hit a historic high of $4,000 an ounce, making this year its best since 1979, a period marked by recession. This surge is attributed to widespread geopolitical turmoil, a weakening U.S. dollar, and central banks diversifying reserves after Western sanctions on Russia. Investors view gold as a safe-haven asset, distrusting contemporary monetary policy and the dollar's stability amid rising national debt and inflation. While the S&P 500 is also up, suggesting a bifurcated market, the gold rally reflects pessimism about the global economy and a return to ancient, tangible assets. (not investment advice)</p>

The future governance of Gaza and Hamas's disarmament remain contentious issues, with Hamas publicly rejecting giving up arms despite international pressure.
