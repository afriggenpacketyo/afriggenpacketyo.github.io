          <p>A Russian An-24 passenger plane with 49 people aboard, including five children, has crashed in the country's Amur region. The aircraft, which was traveling from Blagoveshchensk to Tynda, disappeared from radar before its wreckage was discovered. Officials from Russia's federal aviation agency and Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed that a "burning fuselage" was found by a search and rescue helicopter. The incident is currently under investigation as a developing story.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India are finalizing a landmark free trade agreement, which both governments anticipate will significantly boost their respective economies. Under the deal, India will reduce tariffs on key British imports like cars and spirits, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a major victory that will create jobs and drive growth, with bilateral trade projected to increase by £25.5 billion annually by 2040. The deal now awaits approval from the UK parliament before it can take effect.</p>

          <p>The White House has refuted reports claiming President Trump was informed that his name appears in Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson dismissed the story as "fake news," despite ongoing political pressure for greater transparency on the matter. This development coincides with a House subcommittee's vote to subpoena the DOJ for its Epstein files. The article notes that being named in the documents does not imply wrongdoing and that the Trump administration has faced criticism for its handling of the issue.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's ruling against President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the order, which would deny citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary residents, to be unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision keeps a nationwide injunction in place, blocking the policy's enforcement. The ruling marks another significant legal obstacle for the administration's efforts to change long-standing citizenship rules based on the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated an "American AI Action Plan" by signing executive orders designed to shape the development and use of artificial intelligence. A key order aims to prevent "woke AI" in the federal government, specifically targeting models that incorporate ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The administration argues these ideologies compromise truthfulness and accuracy, mandating that government-procured AI must be neutral and nonpartisan. Other orders focus on removing regulatory hurdles to spur innovation and creating a program to promote U.S. AI technology exports.</p>

          <p>The UK's vehicle manufacturing sector has experienced its worst first-half-year performance since 1953, excluding the pandemic shutdown period. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reveals a 7.3% drop in car output and a 45% decline in van production, largely due to a plant closure and uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. While the production of electric vehicles saw a modest increase, the overall figures are described as "depressing" by the industry body. The government hopes new EV grants and a recent US-UK tariff deal will help restore confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is facing an unexpected oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy sector, with a significant glut of incinerators operating well below capacity. While the country's incineration capacity has more than doubled since 2019, the volume of municipal solid waste has only increased by about 11%, leaving an estimated 40% of the industry's capacity idle. This imbalance is attributed to overly optimistic planning, an economic downturn, and a slowdown in urbanization, which have collectively tempered the growth of waste generation. The situation highlights a unique challenge within China's broader industrial overcapacity issues.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Lauren Pisciotta, a former assistant to Kanye West, states that his client is in hiding out of fear after filing a lawsuit against the rapper. The civil suit includes serious allegations of sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual assault, all of which West has denied, calling them "fantasy fiction." The updated complaint also alleges that Pisciotta was a victim of "swatting" after the initial lawsuit was filed. Her lawyer says she has deleted her online presence and is waiting for the legal process to unfold, highlighting the personal toll of the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's upcoming private visit to his golf resorts in Scotland is expected to be met with significant protests from Ayrshire to Aberdeenshire. Organizers from the Stop Trump Coalition are planning events, anticipating a "wave of resistance" fueled by what they describe as widespread public anger over the U.S. president's increasingly extreme policies. While the visit is not official, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to hold talks with Trump in Scotland. Police Scotland expects the protests to be lawful but acknowledges the large-scale policing operation will stretch their resources.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their long-standing convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by a UK court. The successful appeal, after a decade-long legal battle, overturns one of the most high-profile prosecutions following the 2008 financial crisis. The ruling raises significant questions about potential compensation for wrongful conviction and has led to calls for a public inquiry into the scandal. The decision is also expected to prompt appeals from at least seven other traders who were jailed for similar rate-rigging offenses.</p>

          <p>A growing mental health crisis among UK university students is raising questions about the role and responsibility of higher education institutions. Students report feeling let down by "one-size-fits-all" university wellbeing services, while academic staff feel untrained to handle complex mental health issues. The number of students reporting a mental health condition has nearly quadrupled in a decade, yet universities stress they are not a replacement for clinical NHS services. The debate intensifies over whether universities have a formal duty of care, with experts calling for better resources and clearer pathways for support.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual move, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a decision widely seen as an escalation of his public pressure campaign against its chairman, Jerome Powell. The visit breaks with the long-standing tradition of respecting the central bank's political independence. Trump has repeatedly and publicly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he has the authority to fire the Fed chair. This direct confrontation at the Federal Reserve's headquarters marks a remarkable challenge to the institution's autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing crisis, states like Utah are increasingly intervening to force local municipalities to approve more affordable and high-density housing. Frustrated by local "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard) opposition that stalls development, state governments are passing laws that override restrictive local zoning rules. These measures aim to address the severe shortage of housing that has priced out many middle-class and young residents. While proponents see it as a necessary step to create wealth and opportunity, some local officials criticize the top-down mandates for overriding community planning.</p>
