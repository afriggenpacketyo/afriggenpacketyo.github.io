          <h2>Piracy of Premium TV, Including Football, Occurs on 'Industrial Scale'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that piracy of premium video services, especially live sports, is happening on an "industrial scale," enabled by a lack of action from big tech firms. The research accuses Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia," resulting in revenue losses for broadcasters and increased cyber-crime risks for users. The Amazon Fire Stick is identified as a major enabler of piracy, with many using it to access illegal streams. While sports broadcasting is a big business, illegal streaming poses a financial crisis and exposes users to scams.</p>

          <p>France will extend its smoking ban to include beaches, public gardens, and areas near schools starting July 1, aiming to protect young people from tobacco and reduce the influence of smokers. Health Minister Catherine Vautrin emphasized the importance of children's right to breathe clean air. The ban will also affect middle and high schools, preventing students from smoking in front of their schools. This measure is part of a national plan to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2032 and has strong public support.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has achieved success in predicting landslides through advanced technologies and continuous monitoring of various factors, including rainfall and ground movement. The destructive landslide in Blatten serves as a reminder of the risks, but early warnings allowed residents to evacuate. Government agencies maintain hazard risk maps across the country, enabling communities to prepare for potential disasters. Despite Switzerland's success, predicting landslides remains a challenge globally, and efforts are being made to strengthen international monitoring and preparedness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A higher education expert warns that the House Republicans' proposed changes to federal student loans, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could result in "indentured servitude." The plan proposes repayment terms of up to 30 years, raising concerns about borrowers carrying debt into middle age. Under the proposed bill, borrowers would have two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years. Critics argue the extended repayment period would disproportionately burden borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
