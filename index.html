          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the "steady progress" in improving bilateral relations with China, following years of strained ties that included a deadly 2020 border clash. This diplomatic thaw began with a meeting between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia last year, marking their first formal discussion since 2019. Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in seven years, signals a significant warming of relations. The article suggests that U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, which have strained ties between New Delhi and Washington, have also contributed to India and China increasing official visits and discussing eased trade restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is significantly expanding its efforts to secure international agreements, enabling the U.S. to deport migrants to countries that are not their origin, as detailed in newly obtained internal government documents. Recent deals with Honduras and Uganda highlight this strategy, where these nations agree to accept specific groups of deportees from other countries, including families. This initiative, rooted in a "safe third country" provision, aims to deter illegal immigration by increasing the possibility of migrants being sent to unfamiliar distant locations. Human rights advocates strongly condemn these practices, expressing serious concerns that migrants could face harm or be returned to unsafe conditions in countries with documented human rights abuses, despite some nations' cooperation with humanitarian protection for refugees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that Intel must provide the U.S. government an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, marking a significant policy shift from the Biden administration's grant approach. This new condition, championed by the Trump administration, aims to secure a return for taxpayer money invested in chip manufacturing, though without granting the government voting or governance rights in the company. Intel, which had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant for building factories in Ohio, is now subject to this requirement. This move aligns with President Trump's broader agenda to reshore U.S. manufacturing and could establish a precedent for other companies receiving CHIPS Act funding.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is projected to strengthen and bring dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding to the U.S. East Coast, despite not making direct landfall. Currently a Category 2 storm, it is expected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. coast, with its large size extending hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from its center. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for Hatteras and Ocracoke islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks due to anticipated life-threatening inundation and road closures. Officials warn of unsafe ocean conditions across nearly the entire East Coast for much of the week, urging people to heed warnings from local authorities regarding the significant risk of rip currents and high waves.</p>

          <p>A Democratic state lawmaker in Texas, Representative Nicole Collier, spent the night on the state House floor, refusing a Republican-mandated police escort. This act of protest comes amid a contentious legislative session where Republicans are pushing to redraw congressional districts, a move that could significantly increase GOP seats. Democrats previously fled the state for two weeks to deny a quorum, and upon their return, faced surveillance and strict conditions to leave the Capitol. Collier, representing a minority-majority district, called herself a "political prisoner," underscoring the intense partisan battle over redistricting in Texas and the perceived denial of her dignity.</p>

          <p>The stock market is experiencing a significant rotation, with investors moving away from high-flying, year-to-date winners and momentum stocks, including the crypto sector, towards value-themed laggards. This shift is evident in the divergence between the S&P 500 and the equal-weight S&P 500 ETF, indicating that the average stock is outperforming the largest companies in the index. Many top-performing stocks of 2025 are now declining, while value-based ideas within portfolios are showing strength. This market dynamic often catches investors off guard and typically lasts a few sessions, highlighting the importance of securing profits after substantial upward movements.

He admitted to receiving approximately $2 million from North Korean officials to procure goods, which he then concealed in shipping containers falsely labeled as consumer items. Federal agents seized a chemical threat identification device and ammunition from his home, confirming his intent to send them to North Korea's military, highlighting a successful interdiction of illegal activities.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has remained largely silent regarding federal immigration raids occurring near its stores, despite being significantly impacted by the Trump administration's crackdown. These raids target day laborers and food sellers who often gather near the stores seeking work, creating fear and affecting store traffic. The company's official stance is that it is not notified in advance of operations and is required to follow all federal regulations, advising associates not to engage for safety reasons. Critics, including day laborer advocates, argue Home Depot has a moral obligation to defend these individuals, who are both customers and a convenient, on-demand workforce for contractors and DIYers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While annuities offer retirement income stability, they come with significant drawbacks that prospective retirees should carefully consider. High fees, ranging from 1% to 3% annually, can quietly erode returns over time, alongside additional charges for riders and administrative costs. Surrender charges, penalizing early withdrawals for up to 10 years, create inflexibility for unexpected expenses common in retirement. The complexity of annuity contracts, often filled with industry jargon, makes understanding true costs and benefits challenging for the average person. Furthermore, fixed annuities are vulnerable to inflation, and they often sacrifice the higher growth potential historically found in stock investments, posing a considerable opportunity cost.

The move comes as the White House, specifically Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, criticizes India for "profiteering" by purchasing and reselling cheap Russian oil, leading to increased U.S. tariffs of up to 100%. Despite this geopolitical friction, Apple's substantial commitment to investing in U.S. manufacturing is expected to mitigate the impact of India-related tariffs on the company's operations.</p>

          <p>NASA's Webb Space Telescope has made a new and exciting discovery, spotting a previously unknown tiny moon orbiting Uranus. This new lunar addition, estimated to be just six miles wide, was identified by the telescope's near-infrared camera during observations in February. Scientists believe its faintness and small size allowed it to remain undetected for so long, even eluding the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its flyby about 40 years ago. The discovery increases Uranus's known moon count to 29, with this newest, yet-unnamed, member joining a group of moons typically named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial savings, high-yield savings accounts present a compelling option to earn significant returns compared to traditional accounts, which often lose value to inflation. With a $150,000 deposit at a competitive 4.35% APY, such an account could earn over $1,600 in interest within three months and more than $6,500 over a year. While interest rates are variable and subject to Federal Reserve policies, current elevated rates offer genuine opportunities for savvy savers. The article advises looking for accounts with no monthly fees and reasonable minimums, emphasizing that delaying action means missing out on potential earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite pressure from figures like President Trump to cede territory for peace, Ukraine is highly unlikely to relinquish control of areas like the Donbas, even those not yet fully conquered by Russia. Ukrainian officials maintain that their constitution prevents them from "giving up territory," and ceding strategically vital "fortress belt" cities would significantly weaken their defenses. While a de facto freezing of current front lines might be a pragmatic, albeit painful, option, formally recognizing Russian control would legitimize conquest by force, setting a dangerous global precedent. For Ukrainians, who have suffered immense losses defending their land, such a concession would be a profound blow to morale and national sovereignty.</p>

The proposal includes significantly elevated funding for each men's squad, a focus on predominantly Welsh-qualified players, and a centralized national campus for training.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, however, disputed the map's percentages during his White House meeting, arguing against ceding land and emphasizing that Russian forces have occupied less than 1% of Ukrainian territory since November 2022.
