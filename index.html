          <p>Front pages in the UK are dominated by the arrival of 1,097 migrants on Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's first day, pushing the year's total over 30,000. Mahmood described the figure as "utterly unacceptable," with some newspapers advocating for the UK to leave the European Court of Human Rights as a solution. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer's new cabinet is tasked with securing economic growth, changing building and net-zero regulations, and pushing welfare reforms. Unions have voiced concerns over the departure of Angela Rayner and the Employment Rights Minister, urging the government not to abandon workers' rights. Amidst these political developments, many papers also celebrate England's cricketers securing their largest men's one-day-international winning margin against South Africa.</p>

          <p>A former Army Sergeant Major, Michael Webber, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting Gunner Jaysley Beck, a teenage soldier who subsequently took her own life. Beck, 19, reported Webber for pinning her down and attempting to kiss her at a work event. An inquest determined the Army's mishandling of her complaint contributed significantly to her death, as superiors pressured her to drop allegations and failed to report the incident to the police. Beck's mother expressed relief at the guilty plea but emphasized that nothing can undo the devastating loss of her daughter, highlighting the Army's failure to protect her.</p>

          <p>Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei's La Libertad Avanza (LLA) party experienced a substantial loss in the Buenos Aires provincial elections to the opposition Peronist party. The Peronist candidate, Axel Kicillof, secured 46.8% of the vote, significantly surpassing LLA's 33.8%, a wider margin than polls predicted. Milei acknowledged the "clear defeat" and vowed to "accelerate" his libertarian reforms, focusing on fiscal balance and inflation control, despite the setback. This loss, coupled with a recent bribery scandal involving his sister, highlights growing public unease over his public spending cuts and presents a challenge ahead of national midterm elections.</p>

This engagement follows a surge of 1,097 small boat arrivals on her first full day in office, contributing to over 30,000 arrivals this year—a 37% increase from last year. Mahmood described the figures as "utterly unacceptable." Discussions will also cover tackling child sexual abuse online and the spread of synthetic opioids. The government is exploring expanding military sites and other non-military accommodations for asylum seekers, a plan criticized by the Refugee Council for lacking focus on faster, fairer decisions and safe community housing.</p>

Bolsonaro, along with seven co-defendants, faces accusations of plotting to overturn the 2022 election results. A guilty verdict would make him the first former president in Brazil's history convicted of attempting a coup, potentially leading to over 40 years in prison. These rallies highlight the ongoing political polarization and significant legal challenges confronting the former leader.</p>

The sanctions, a rare move, entail freezing any assets he holds in Chinese territory, prohibiting transactions with him or his family, and denying them visas for entry to mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. This action signals escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations over geopolitical narratives.</p>

China has increasingly diversified its trade to Southeast Asia, EU, Africa, and Latin America due to U.S. trade policies, yet the U.S. remains its largest single-country trading partner.

          <p>Ryan Wesley Routh is set to stand trial in Florida this week for an alleged plot to assassinate President Donald Trump last September. Routh, 59, is accused of firing on a Secret Service agent at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach and possessing an SKS semiautomatic rifle and documents listing Trump's upcoming events. A witness also reported a note from Routh expressing regret for failing an assassination attempt. Routh, who has a criminal history and supports Ukraine, has pleaded not guilty and made the unusual decision to represent himself, despite a judge's strong advice against it.</p>

          <p>Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, is calling on the UK government to demonstrate its commitment to working-class communities following the recent Labour reshuffle. Speaking at the annual conference, Nowak will argue that Labour's promise of change has not yet translated into "lived reality" for many, urging the government to make "right political choices." He advocates for lifting the two-child benefit cap, funded by new wealth taxes. Sharon Graham, Unite union leader, also warned Labour, suggesting members might vote to disaffiliate if living standards don't improve, potentially benefiting Reform UK. Concerns also exist about watering down the Employment Rights Bill.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a "last warning" to Hamas, urging the Palestinian militant group to accept a deal for the release of hostages from Gaza. Trump asserted that "The Israelis have accepted my Terms" and warned Hamas of severe consequences if they do not comply. Hamas later confirmed receiving proposals from the US via mediators and is currently reviewing them, reiterating its willingness to negotiate for all hostages in exchange for a "clear announcement of an end to the war" and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave. Trump expressed optimism for an imminent deal, believing all hostages, alive or deceased, would be returned.</p>

          <p>France's parliament is poised to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou, signaling a continued political deadlock that has plagued the country for over a year. Bayrou initiated a surprise confidence vote to "shock" politicians into addressing France's looming debt crisis, which he warned could lead to "disorder and chaos." Despite his warnings about spiraling national debt and the need for austerity, Bayrou lacks the necessary votes. This situation stems from President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election, which resulted in a weakened minority government and a deeply divided parliament, pushing the political landscape further right.</p>

Ahmed's family and neighbors had complained for months about Whybrow's aggressive and anti-social behavior, alleging that police and the council did not adequately respond.

          <p>Chicago churches are urging congregants to remain calm and informed amidst expected federal interventions regarding immigration and crime. Reverend Marshall Hatch advised identifying oneself and staying connected, protesting against what he called "fascism and authoritarianism." President Trump has threatened federal action in Democratic-led cities, including Chicago, despite local objections and lower crime rates compared to some red-state cities. The prospect of increased federal agencies and National Guard deployment has heightened tensions, particularly in Black and Latino communities where trust in law enforcement is fragile. Churches are also preparing for potential chilling effects on attendance due to fear of detention and deportation.</p>

The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds and featuring intricate carvings by the renowned artist Charles Looff, will require substantial repairs to restore it to working order.

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from US equities for the first time in a decade, shifting capital into Asia, according to Bank of America. This move is attributed to a weakening US dollar, anticipated easing of Federal Reserve monetary policy, and Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market. While US equities attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020-2024, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now allocating evenly between US and international markets. BofA projects the global AI market to nearly quadruple to $1.2 trillion by 2030, with approximately $1 trillion potentially deployed in Asia-Pacific, offering unique opportunities and better valuations.
