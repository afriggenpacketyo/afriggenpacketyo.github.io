          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary, indicating voter dissatisfaction with the current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, though Pittsburgh hasn't had a Republican mayor since 1932, making the Democratic primary win crucial. Gainey's loss halts the momentum progressives had enjoyed in this Democratic stronghold, despite his efforts to address affordable housing. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would rebuild the city's tax base and take a conciliatory approach toward institutions like universities and real estate developers.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the historical trend of US presidents, including Joe Biden, concealing the true state of their health from the public, a practice often associated with ageing dictators. A new book alleges that the political and media establishment in Washington colluded to cover up Biden's declining mental health during his presidency. The family's recent announcement about Biden's aggressive prostate cancer raises questions about when they first became aware of his condition, given the extensive medical check-ups presidents receive. Donald Trump has also publicly mused about a third term, prohibited under the 22nd constitutional amendment following Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs unprecedented four terms.</p>

          <p>A top aide to the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, allegedly pressured analysts to revise an intelligence assessment of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, aiming to shield President Trump and Gabbard from criticism.

The final memo, while revised, still contradicts Trump's claim that the gang is directed by the Maduro regime. Kent's actions have sparked internal concerns about the politicization of intelligence analysis, as the White House used the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers informed a federal judge that the U.S. government may have deported migrants from countries like Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan. The attorneys said any migrant deported to South Sudan "faces a strong likelihood of irreparable harm," citing reports documenting widespread violence, human rights violations and conflict. Judge Murphy instructed government lawyers to be ready to provide certain information during a hearing, including the names of the deportees and details on what level of due process they received. The Trump administration has been mounting an aggressive diplomatic campaign to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has defended his approach to negotiate a comprehensive peace deal while continuing to wage war in Ukraine, with his hard-line position withstanding pressure for an immediate cease-fire. Despite this, his diplomatic victory could undermine or delay his broader economic goals to normalize relations with the United States. President Trump emphasized that American economic rapprochement with Russia would come after peace in Ukraine, not before, potentially confining Russia to economic purgatory. A modest deal to exchange prisoners was mentioned after the leaders‚Äô call, a far cry from the hopes entertained by Russian business elites.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumour types from weeks to hours, with surgeons calling it a "game changer." The method, developed at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour in as little as 90 minutes. This faster classification could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly and reduce anxiety while waiting for results. Several NHS hospitals are setting up their own testing alongside existing regimes to gather more evidence about its effectiveness.</p>
