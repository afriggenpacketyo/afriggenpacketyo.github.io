        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has publicly rebuked Senator Dick Durbin following his claims that the agency is misallocating resources. Durbin asserted at a hearing that Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents were being diverted from pursuing dangerous criminals to "arresting gardeners" and other immigrants who pose no threat. In a sharp response, DHS stated its agents are focused on apprehending the "worst of the worst" and accused the senator of contributing to an environment that has seen a significant increase in attacks on ICE personnel. The department's statement also pointedly noted that Durbin's own state of Illinois provides sanctuary protections for criminal non-citizens.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress is evaluating the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents, including large financial institutions and crypto firms, argue that clear rules would enhance consumer protection, reduce volatility, and facilitate faster, lower-cost digital transactions. The legislation aims to legally define what can be termed a stablecoin, potentially opening the market for banks and credit unions to issue their own digital currencies and boosting their mainstream adoption in the financial system. The move is part of a broader push to bring regulatory clarity to the digital asset industry.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has scheduled an October 16 execution for death row inmate Robert Roberson, who was convicted in 2002 for the death of his two-year-old daughter. His case has drawn significant attention due to evolving scientific understanding of "shaken baby syndrome," the diagnosis central to his conviction. Roberson's legal team is actively appealing for a new trial, presenting new expert testimony from pathologists who question the original cause of death and assert that no crime occurred. The case continues to fuel intense debate over capital punishment and the reliability of past medical evidence in criminal convictions.</p>

It also hears cases based on specific treaties, such as the Genocide Convention, which has been invoked in recent cases involving Ukraine, Myanmar, and Israel.

          <p>A recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index, which rose 2.7% annually in June, suggests that persistent inflationary pressures could impact borrowing costs for consumers. Because the Federal Reserve combats inflation by maintaining high interest rates, the variable APRs on most credit cards are likely to remain elevated or even climb higher. With the average credit card rate already exceeding 21%, continued inflation could mean more of consumers' payments go toward interest, making it harder to pay down debt. Financial experts advise consumers with credit card balances to proactively seek solutions like balance transfers or consolidation loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in several years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has resumed transferring inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The transfers, involving at least 20 individuals in May and June, were conducted using federal judicial warrants, a legal pathway not prohibited by state and local sanctuary policies. These policies generally forbid local law enforcement from enforcing civil immigration laws but contain exceptions for criminal cases. The use of judicial warrants for offenses like illegal reentry represents a new tactical approach by the Trump administration to facilitate deportations in jurisdictions with sanctuary laws.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced the Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act to impose restrictions and require transparency for donations to presidential libraries. The proposal follows a series of multi-million dollar payments to President Trump's future library from corporations like Paramount, Disney, and Meta as part of legal settlements. The bill aims to close loopholes that critics say allow individuals, corporations, and foreign entities to curry favor with a sitting president. Proposed rules include a cap on contributions, a ban on donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and a delay on fundraising until after a president leaves office.</p>

The officials are accused of fabricating police reports for a businessman, Chandrakant Patel, who used them to fraudulently apply for U visas for immigrants. These visas are designated for victims of certain crimes, and the indictment alleges the officers created false reports of armed robberies in exchange for payments. The scheme allegedly produced hundreds of fraudulent reports, creating the appearance of a crime wave that never actually occurred, and implicates officials from multiple local agencies.</p>

          <p>A top UN trade official has warned that President Trump's tariff policies are creating a "cascade" effect that disrupts global supply chains and disproportionately harms less developed nations. Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary General of UNCTAD, stated that the high level of uncertainty is paralyzing business investment and has contributed to a downward revision of global growth forecasts. The UN projects that the most vulnerable countries could see their exports fall by over 50% if the threatened tariffs are fully implemented. This economic pressure is compounded by rising shipping and insurance costs due to attacks in the Red Sea. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump has been a vocal critic of Powell, whom he appointed, for not lowering interest rates more aggressively.
