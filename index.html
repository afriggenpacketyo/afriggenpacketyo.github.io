          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, accusing them of siding with Hamas following their condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza. Netanyahu claims their criticism emboldens "mass murderers, rapists, baby killers, and kidnappers," and effectively supports Hamas remaining in power. This comes after the UK, France, and Canada denounced Israel's offensive as disproportionate and suspended trade talks. The article also mentions an Israeli minister accusing Starmer and others of emboldening terror forces, while UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard defended Israel's right to self-defense within international law.</p>
