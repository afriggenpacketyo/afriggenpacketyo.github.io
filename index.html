          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced on social media that he convinced Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. Trump, a known fan of Diet Coke, praised the alleged decision as a positive move for the company. In response, Coca-Cola acknowledged Trump's enthusiasm and stated that more details about new product innovations would be shared soon, without explicitly confirming the switch. The company currently uses cane sugar in products sold in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.3-magnitude earthquake occurred off the Alaskan coast, prompting a tsunami advisory for South Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter was 54 miles south of the town of Sand Point. Authorities initially issued a tsunami warning but later downgraded it, urging residents in the advisory zone to move away from coastal areas and bodies of water as a precaution. A similar earthquake in July 2023 in the same seismically active region caused no major damage.</p>

          <p>An NPR report examines the consequences of the extensive tariffs on imports implemented by the Trump administration, questioning when and how American consumers will bear the financial burden. The article notes that despite fluctuating rates, tariffs have remained high on nearly all goods imported into the U.S., a move intended to bolster the domestic economy. Economists and other experts have consistently predicted that these tariffs, which function as a tax, will ultimately be paid by consumers through higher prices for goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. If passed, the legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue this would enable faster, lower-cost transactions, while integrating the $250 billion market more formally into the U.S. financial system. (not investment advice)</p>
