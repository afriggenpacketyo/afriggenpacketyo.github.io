          <p>During the trial of Karen Read, accused of killing Boston police officer John O'Keefe, his mother, Peggy O'Keefe, conveyed a strong, wordless message through her expressions and demeanor in the courtroom. A body language expert described Peggy O'Keefe's looks as "stalker eyes," suggesting deep distrust and a belief that Read is responsible for her son's death. The expert noted the contrast between O'Keefe's distress and the cordial behavior of Read's father, who has been seen greeting supporters outside the courthouse. The dynamic between the families adds another layer of complexity to the already contentious trial, as both sides seek to solidify support and influence public perception.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams that claim artificial intelligence can predict questions for the national college entrance examination, known as the gaokao. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly launched a campaign to investigate and eliminate "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Scammers are selling mock papers at inflated prices, falsely claiming they use AI to predict actual questions. The government warns against these deceptive practices, which exploit the high stakes and competitive nature of the gaokao.</p>

Andreatta stated she now has a good baseline to understand where the team stands, though she was unsure if that baseline was higher or lower than expected. She acknowledged that the first half performance was subpar, but changes brought some fight later on, though ultimately it was not enough. Andreatta emphasized that this transition will take time, suggesting that immediate improvements are unlikely, and it will be a gradual process.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a Â£2bn upgrade project. Initially drawn up in 1990, the 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. Despite criticisms over its cost and duration, Welsh ministers assert the upgrade will generate jobs, opportunities, and better connect communities across the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax bill, which includes a levy on remittances leaving the US, is expected to significantly impact African economies. The tax, set at 3.5% for non-US citizens, will affect millions of Africans who rely on remittances from relatives abroad. Remittances are a major source of income for many African countries, often outweighing aid and foreign direct investment. Experts warn that the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, reducing transparency and potentially harming vulnerable populations. (not investment advice)</p>
