        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the interim head of NASA. This appointment follows the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur backed by Elon Musk, as the nominee for the permanent role. Trump cited Isaacman's Democratic political donations and close professional ties to Musk, whose company SpaceX holds significant NASA contracts, as reasons for the change. Duffy's temporary leadership comes at a critical time as the agency pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and a future mission to Mars.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth stimulation. This move comes as the central bank evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures designed to cool down Seoul's rapidly heating housing market, which saw prices surge over 19% in June. Authorities are concerned about the significant rise in household debt linked to real estate. The decision to hold rates follows a cut in May, which occurred during a period of political uncertainty and US tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that a 50% tariff on copper imports will take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment. The administration justified the move by highlighting copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military hardware, and other essential technologies. This announcement caused copper prices to surge, with U.S. consumers potentially facing significantly higher costs than the global average. The policy aligns with the administration's goal of reshoring critical production, though experts note it will take years to ramp up domestic supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff policies are creating significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers who have relocated or expanded their operations to Southeast Asian nations to bypass previous trade barriers. President Trump's recent moves have put the region in Washington's crosshairs, targeting transshipment strategies used by Chinese companies. The lack of clear implementation details regarding these new tariff threats has left many businesses in a state of limbo. This ambiguity is forcing Chinese exporters to adopt cautious strategies, delaying investments and shipments as they await clarity on the evolving trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision reverses a recent, temporary halt in some arms shipments, a pause which the president claimed he was not aware of who ordered it. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending the weapons at Trump's direction to secure a lasting peace. The move comes after Trump expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian populations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to raise costs for a wide array of products, from household appliances and electronics to electric vehicles. Economists and industry experts warn that since copper is a fundamental component in electrical wiring, plumbing, and manufacturing, the tariff will likely lead to inflation as companies pass increased costs to consumers. The White House defended the policy as a necessary step to reshore critical manufacturing. However, critics argue it could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive.

However, this proposal is facing resistance from environmental groups, who are concerned about weakening crucial protections. The debate highlights the growing tension between the urgent need for clean energy development and the state's long-standing environmental standards.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially rebounded from its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining nearly a year lower than in 2019. While the virus was the primary driver of the initial drop, the slower recovery is now attributed mainly to drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The research highlights significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery in life expectancy compared to white and Asian residents.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 jobs at NASA, targeting high-ranking employees with specialized skills and management experience. According to documents obtained by Politico, the move is part of a broader push to reduce the size of the federal government through buyouts, early retirement, and deferred resignations. The proposed cuts have alarmed former NASA officials, who warned in a letter to Congress that they would cede U.S. leadership in space to China. This development adds to the uncertainty at the agency, which is also facing significant budget cuts and remains without a confirmed administrator.</p>

          <p>The European Union has expressed hope that a framework for a trade agreement with the United States could be reached within days, even as President Trump continues to announce new tariff threats. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic stated that good progress had been made, while Trump issued new tariff notices for six more countries, including Algeria and the Philippines. The potential deal comes as the U.S. has widened its trade actions, recently threatening duties on major partners like Japan and South Korea.

          <p>As deadly floodwaters rose rapidly in Kerr County, Texas, some emergency alerts were delayed because dispatchers needed supervisory approval to activate the system. An analysis of radio traffic reveals a firefighter requesting a CodeRED alert for residents more than an hour before one was sent, only to be told to stand by for authorization. A former county official who helped install the system confirmed the delay, questioning why senior officials were not available to approve the life-saving notifications. Many residents, including a family that narrowly escaped their flooded home, reported never receiving any official warning.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has recorded 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections since 1992 and surpassing the total for all of 2019. The majority of cases are linked to a significant outbreak in West Texas, which resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, with MMR vaccination coverage in schools falling below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. The CDC continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the highly contagious and potentially severe virus.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal employees. The court's decision allows the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. A coalition of labor unions had successfully obtained the injunction, arguing the president exceeded his authority, but the Supreme Court found the government was likely to succeed in its case. The ruling deals a significant blow to unions and puts thousands of federal jobs at risk.</p>

The strike by 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees, led to piles of uncollected trash across the city during a summer heatwave. The new three-year contract reportedly includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Workers, including sanitation crews, immediately returned to their jobs as the city began cleanup efforts, with a union ratification vote pending.</p>

          <p>This article presents a cultural analysis of Pixar's new film 'Elio,' arguing that its themes of alienation and searching for a home feel deeply political in the current climate. The story of a Latino boy who feels he doesn't belong on Earth is viewed as a metaphor for the experience of many Latinos in the U.S. facing anti-immigrant sentiment and policies like ICE raids. The piece suggests the film's poor box office performance could be partially influenced by a community living in fear. It concludes that the movie offers a powerful message of redefining home and belonging for children who may feel ostracized.</p>
