          <p>A Japanese court rejected a damages order against former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) related to the Fukushima nuclear crisis. This decision follows previous unsuccessful attempts to hold the executives accountable for the disaster, which was triggered by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The ruling highlights the ongoing legal battles and the challenges in assigning responsibility for the nuclear accident. The court's decision underscores the complexities of the Fukushima case and the difficulties in proving direct causation and negligence on the part of the executives. </p>

          <p>President Trump has suspended foreign student visas at Harvard University for six months, citing national security concerns and alleging the university has failed to address foreign entanglements and civil rights issues. Harvard responded by filing court documents to block the order, calling it retaliatory and a violation of free speech. This action escalates an ongoing legal dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard, which has faced accusations of antisemitism and has had federal funding frozen.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served while awaiting trial. This practice, prevalent in many states, extends the duration of confinement for young people, impacting their rehabilitation and costing taxpayers. Experts argue that this disparity stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of fundamental rights. The lack of credit for time served in detention can have negative consequences on young people's lives and futures.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a social media scam offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The deceptive advertisement asks for personal information and payment through unofficial channels like Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never requests personal information or payments through social media or transaction applications. The agency advises individuals to renew their vehicle registration only through the official DMV website, a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>
