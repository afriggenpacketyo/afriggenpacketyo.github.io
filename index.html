        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the academic year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans. Federal loans are generally recommended as the first option due to their fixed interest rates and robust borrower protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and potential forgiveness. However, they have strict borrowing limits that may not cover the full cost of attendance. Private loans can fill this funding gap but often require a strong credit history or a co-signer and lack the flexible repayment options of their federal counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following sharp criticism from the White House, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review a controversial $2.5 billion renovation project for its Washington, D.C. buildings. President Trump and other officials have accused the central bank of mismanagement and excessive spending on the project, which has experienced cost overruns. The Fed, which is not taxpayer-funded, has defended the renovation, stating it is necessary to address safety issues like asbestos and bring the aging buildings up to modern code.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy's next-generation attack submarine program, SSN(X), is facing a significant delay, with its production start date pushed back to 2040 due to budget constraints and escalating costs. Originally planned for 2031, the delay raises concerns about maintaining U.S. undersea dominance. Each SSN(X) vessel is projected to cost between $6.7 billion and $8 billion, a substantial increase over the current Virginia-class submarines. This setback is part of a broader challenge for the Navy, which is struggling with production backlogs and rising costs across its shipbuilding programs.</p>

          <p>Despite extensive lobbying from doctors, hospitals, and insurers, Republican lawmakers proceeded with significant cuts to Medicaid funding as part of a larger tax and spending bill. This article suggests the healthcare industry's warnings were overridden by a strong political will to deliver a legislative victory for President Trump. Factors contributing to the lobby's failure include lingering GOP frustration over the industry's support for the Affordable Care Act and a belief that lawmakers feared presidential backlash more than local constituent anger. Some minor concessions, like a rural hospital fund, were secured but did not prevent the larger cuts.</p>

          <p>Two recent judicial rulings in cases against AI firms Anthropic and Meta have provided initial, yet conflicting, guidance on the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. While both judges deemed the training process itself to be "fair use," they diverged on key issues, such as whether AI-generated content unfairly competes with human authors. The rulings also left the companies vulnerable to litigation over their methods of acquiring training data, including the use of pirated book libraries. This article argues that these decisions are merely the first step in a complex legal debate that will define the future of generative AI and creative professions.</p>

Prosecutors argued the couple deliberately failed to keep their daughter safe, exposing her to cold and damp conditions in a tent. The jury's verdict indicates they found the parents' actions fell far below a reasonable standard of care. The couple was also found guilty of child cruelty and perverting the course of justice.</p>

          <p>New research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve indicates that the Trump administration's tariffs are a double-edged sword for the U.S. economy. The study projects that the tariffs will likely increase manufacturing jobs but lead to a net decrease in overall U.S. employment and real income over the next four years. While a majority of states might see a rise in inflation-adjusted income, declines in large states like California and Texas would result in an overall national drop. The analysis assumes significant tariff levels on goods from China, Mexico, Canada, and the rest of the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee has put North Carolina's state board of elections on notice of a potential lawsuit over a plan to purge nearly 100,000 voters from the rolls. The Republican-majority board voted to require voters who have not provided specific identification numbers to cast provisional ballots, which may not be counted. The DNC argues this move effectively removes registered voters and violates the National Voter Registration Act, claiming it is a partisan effort to disenfranchise voters in the key battleground state. The state board maintains it is acting to comply with a court order.</p>

          <h2>White House Advisor Claims 'Patriotism' Prevents Tariffs from Causing Inflation</h2>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has offered a novel explanation for why President Trump's tariffs have not caused widespread inflation, attributing it to American patriotism. He theorized that the president's leadership has inspired consumers to prefer American-made products, causing demand for imports to fall so significantly that it has offset any price increases from tariffs. This view contrasts with that of many economists, who argue that importers have stockpiled goods or that foreign countries are absorbing the costs, and that price hikes are still expected.

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. This type of battery is significantly cheaper to manufacture because it does not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are used in conventional lithium-ion batteries. GM stated this move will help scale production of lower-cost EV technologies in the U.S. and diversify its electric vehicle portfolio. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life, has graduated from law school after spending over 28 years in prison. While incarcerated, Duncan became a "jailhouse lawyer," studying law to help himself and hundreds of other inmates navigate the legal system. With the help of the Innocence Project, he proved that detectives had lied to the jury and was released in 2011, later being fully exonerated. Now 60, he has earned his law degree and founded the Light of Justice program to help currently incarcerated people access the courts.</p>

          <p>An international tribunal in The Hague has upheld the war crimes conviction of former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) member Pjeter Shala but has reduced his prison sentence from 18 to 13 years. Shala was convicted in 2024 for torture, murder, and arbitrary detention committed during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian forces. The appeals court reversed some convictions but confirmed others, ultimately determining that the original sentence was disproportionate to comparable cases. The judges noted the reduction in no way diminishes the gravity of the crimes for which he was convicted.</p>

The first of these, named Prometheus, is scheduled to come online in 2026. This major investment is part of a broader strategy to revamp Meta's AI efforts and better compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg also announced the formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, an elite organization of top researchers and engineers aimed at advancing the frontiers of AI.</p>

The CEO stated that AI is changing the industry and the company must adapt by using technology to simplify hiring and reduce manual work. The layoffs will primarily affect research and development teams in the U.S. As part of the shift, Glassdoor's operations will be integrated into Indeed, and its CEO will step down.

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing clear signs of cooling, as a combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand puts downward pressure on prices. According to mortgage technology firm ICE, nearly one-third of the 100 largest housing markets are now seeing annual price declines of at least one percent from their recent peaks. National home price growth slowed to just 1.3% in June, its slowest rate in two years. While prices are still gaining in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening significantly in the South and West. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan for secondary sanctions, which target third-party nations, marks a significant escalation in U.S. pressure on Moscow.

          <p>A new federal spending bill is poised to significantly boost the private jet market by reinstating a key tax provision. The law brings back 100% bonus depreciation, allowing businesses to immediately write off the full purchase price of a new or used jet in the first year of ownership. Aviation brokers report a surge in interest from clients who were waiting for the bill to pass. This tax incentive arrives as the jet market was beginning to cool from its post-pandemic highs, and it is expected to drive a spike in sales, particularly toward the end of the year.
