          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has requested the Trump administration to temporarily halt the demolition of the White House East Wing. The group is concerned that the proposed ballroom annex will overwhelm the White House's existing architecture. Other architectural groups have raised similar concerns about the ballroom's size and its impact on the White House grounds. The White House has dismissed these concerns, referring to them as "manufactured outrage" from leftists, while asserting that nearly every president has made renovations to the White House. The controversy surrounds the scale of the proposed addition and its potential disruption to the historical balance of the White House design. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are intensifying their crackdown on underground Christian churches, reflecting President Xi Jinping's growing intolerance of religious freedom. Numerous pastors and members of the Zion Protestant Church were arrested for "illegally disseminating religious content online" after the church shifted to virtual services. International figures have condemned the actions, calling for the release of those detained and the freedom for people of faith to practice their beliefs without retribution. While some concessions have been made due to international pressure, the persecution highlights the government's desire to control religious beliefs and suppress any perceived political or ideological threats.

          <p>Beijing is extending invitations to guests from Taiwan to participate in the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender of sovereignty over the island. The Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) announced that visits and exchange activities will be organized around the event. China views the restoration of Taiwan as a significant achievement in the war against Japanese aggression, a victory forged through the struggles of the Chinese people, including Taiwanese compatriots. This invitation comes despite warnings from Taipei against attendance, adding another layer to the complex relationship between mainland China and Taiwan.

          <p>Economists are reporting that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, particularly for goods widely imported into the U.S. Product categories such as furniture, car parts, and electronics are seeing the biggest price increases, with businesses passing on a portion of the tariff costs to consumers. While the full impact is still unfolding, tariffs have added measurably to headline and core PCE rates. The White House defends its trade policy as beneficial for the country's manufacturing sector and job growth in the long term, but analysts estimate significant costs for businesses and consumers.

          <p>A 15-hour disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) disrupted internet users worldwide, highlighting the vulnerabilities of a system reliant on a few tech giants.

The issue stemmed from AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers in Northern Virginia, causing a backlog of server requests.

          <p>Experts warn that artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to significantly impact white-collar jobs, with companies like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs already using it to reduce workforce size. Estimates suggest that a notable percentage of U.S. workers could lose their jobs due to AI adoption, particularly in software development, customer service, and clerical work. While new jobs will emerge in AI development and related fields, economists emphasize the need to prepare the workforce for the changes ahead. Despite the anticipation, high-level data has yet to show massive changes in the labor market. (not investment advice) The optimism score for this article is 50.</p>
