          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is focused on securing the club's first major trophy as they prepare to face Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Glasner, who took over in February 2024, has significantly improved the team's performance, achieving the highest points-per-game record of any Palace boss in the Premier League era. Despite challenges during the summer, including player transfers and delayed integration of new signings, Glasner has created a positive environment at the club and is ambitious about their progress, setting their sights on the teams ahead of them in the league table. Palace will qualify for Europe should they win at Wembley.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a passenger bus in north-eastern Ukraine has reportedly killed nine people and injured four others in the town of Bilopillia. The Sumy regional military administration described the attack as "inhumane", stating that the bus was hit by a Russian Lancet drone. This attack occurred shortly after Ukraine and Russia held their first direct peace talks since 2022 in Istanbul, which did not result in a ceasefire agreement but did include an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post interpreted by some Trump supporters as a veiled threat to the president's life. The post showed seashells arranged to form "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to "assassinate" the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, emphasizing his opposition to violence. Trump and top officials rejected Comey's explanation, with Trump labeling Comey a "dirty cop" and suggesting he was calling for the president's assassination.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity following the release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which described him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." Audio recordings from Biden's interview with Hur revealed instances where Biden struggled to remember key dates and events. Biden defended his mental fitness, stating he knew what he was doing and did not need Hur's recommendation. The report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, while Democrats initially criticized Hur's report as politically motivated. Later in 2024, Kamala Harris was defeated by Trump in November's general election.</p>

Residents described the event as something out of the history books, with dirt and debris filling the air. Skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed.</p>

The trial includes allegations of forced participation in "freak-offs" and control over Ventura's life, with the outcome potentially hinging on the jury's interpretation of consent versus compliance.</p>

He was awarded the United Arab Emirates' highest civilian honor, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariffs and immigration policies. Trump touted over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and the visited nations, and used events as campaign-style rallies. The trip highlighted Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy and the Gulf leaders' eagerness to engage with him, despite concerns over human rights records.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear for their survival due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods exported to the United States, their largest market. The tariffs, initially announced at 35% and later revised to 10%, threaten to halt exports and disrupt expansion plans for companies like Ginex. The mayor of Gorazde expressed concern that the U.S. has abandoned its commitment to free trade and economic development as a path to peace. The Bosnian Trade Minister, a Serb nationalist, showed little interest in helping the ammunition companies, further clouding the industry's future.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts, as part of a bill to fund President Trump's agenda, are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. An analysis estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans argue the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, many Americans fear they will lose access to essential services or be forced to choose between healthcare and necessities. The proposed bill would also impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, potentially jeopardizing care for those with disabilities or substance use disorders.</p>
