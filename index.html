          <p>Crystal Palace secured their first major trophy since 1861 by defeating Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final, with Daichi Kamada playing a crucial role in Eberechi Eze's winning goal.

          <p>A new study suggests that a simple change in brick-stacking techniques could significantly reduce air pollution in Bangladesh. Traditional brick kilns contribute substantially to the country's high pollution levels, but researchers found that stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow, along with consistent fueling practices, can reduce fuel use by 23 percent. This would cut carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20%. The interventions also improve worker conditions and save kiln owners money, offering a feasible solution for reducing pollution in the region.</p>

The changes are part of Newsom's plan to address a $12 billion budget deficit, attributing it to Trump's tariffs, rising drug costs, and increased healthcare utilization. While Newsom claims to protect immigrant communities, these measures aim to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-29, sparking debate over balancing fiscal responsibility and healthcare access.</p>
