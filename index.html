          <p>Nintendo announced that its fiscal first-quarter revenue more than doubled year-over-year, driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, significantly boosting its video game platform sales. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its conservative full-year financial guidance. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's prospects, believing an expanded user base will offset short-term profitability declines from potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program to university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." This initiative, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation within Whitehall to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it as "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>Countries across the globe have issued varied responses to the Trump administration's updated list of "reciprocal" tariffs. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief at receiving lower rates than initially proposed, while others, including New Zealand and Switzerland, face higher duties and are seeking further negotiations. Key U.S. allies such as Japan and Australia secured relatively favorable terms, but major trading partners like India face a significant 25% tariff.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced a new schedule of tariffs impacting more than 60 countries, set to take effect in early August. The executive order details duties ranging from 10% to over 40%, with rates largely determined by the U.S. trade deficit with each nation. Canada faces a particularly steep 35% tariff, justified by the White House over border security concerns. While some countries secured lower rates through recent negotiations, the broad implementation of these duties signals a significant escalation in the administration's trade policy.

          <p>The legislative body of El Salvador, dominated by President Nayib Bukele's Nuevas Ideas party, has approved constitutional amendments that permit unlimited presidential reelection. The reforms also extend the presidential term from five to six years and eliminate the need for a runoff election. Critics and opposition parties have condemned the move as a consolidation of authoritarian power that undermines the nation's democracy. The changes place El Salvador alongside Venezuela and Nicaragua in allowing indefinite rule, sparking concerns from civil society groups.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court decision could enable millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance deals. The ruling concerns the legality of hidden commission payments made to car dealers, which were banned in 2021.

          <p>Chinese schoolgirl Yu Zidi has made history as the youngest swimmer to win a medal at the World Aquatics Championships. The 12-year-old earned a bronze medal after participating in the heats for the women's 4x200m freestyle relay. Her participation has sparked debate, as competitors are typically required to be at least 14, but she was granted an exception for meeting the 'A' standard times. While some experts express concern about the physical and mental strain on such a young athlete, others celebrate her as a remarkable prodigy.</p>

          <p>A massive barrage of Russian drones and missiles has struck Kyiv, killing at least 28 people, including three children, and injuring over 150 others. The attack, which caused an apartment block to collapse, represents a major escalation and a defiance of President Trump's demand for a ceasefire by August 8. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a murderous response to peace efforts. Meanwhile, Russia claims to have captured the strategic town of Chasiv Yar, a claim Ukrainian officials dispute as fighting continues in the area.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old Oxnard man has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison for the serial sexual assault of five women between 2012 and 2020. The prosecutor's office stated that Dustin Ronald Alba used dating apps and social media to meet his victims before confining and assaulting them. The case was initiated after a victim reported an assault in 2020, leading investigators to uncover four other victims through messages on the perpetrator's phone. The conviction included nine felony counts for forcible sex acts against multiple vulnerable victims.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, which inevitably leads to more legal challenges requiring the court's intervention. He acknowledged criticism over the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its process. Kavanaugh emphasized that despite disagreements, collegiality among the justices remains strong.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under President Biden, has had her appointment to a position at West Point rescinded. The Army Secretary revoked the offer for Easterly to be a distinguished chair after a pro-Trump activist highlighted the hire on social media, accusing Easterly of undermining the current administration. Easterly called the decision a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The move follows a similar dismissal of another official after being targeted by the same activist.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. In her ruling, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated the administration's decision was likely motivated by racial animus and failed to properly review current country conditions. The ruling provides a reprieve for TPS holders, who were facing the loss of their legal status and deportation protections in August and September, extending them until at least November.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against President Trump's characterization of countries like Australia as "freeloaders" for paying less for prescription drugs. The author points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse health outcomes, a problem rooted in its own systemic failures. Instead of blaming other countries, the U.S. could adopt policies similar to Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) to control its own drug costs. The article concludes that bullying allies is counterproductive to addressing America's deep-seated healthcare issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is currently "broken." Explaining her decision not to run for California governor, Harris said she wants to engage with Americans outside the transactional nature of campaigning. She clarified that her critique is not aimed at public servants but at the systemic fragility of democracy, which she feels is not strong enough to defend fundamental principles. Harris affirmed she would remain part of the fight for those principles from outside the system.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), reported an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion. This growth was slightly ahead of analyst expectations and demonstrates the continued strength of the market leader. However, AWS faces intensifying competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which posted higher quarterly growth rates. AWS remains a major profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income, as all major cloud providers ramp up investment in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep dive into the chaotic and fraught process Thailand underwent to negotiate a reduction in U.S. tariffs from a proposed 36% down to 19%. The negotiations were complicated by Thailand's fractious coalition government, domestic political pressures, and U.S. demands for access to its protected agricultural market. Thai manufacturers, vital to the export-driven economy, desperately needed a deal to remain competitive. The experience highlights the immense challenge countries face in navigating President Trump's unpredictable trade policy and the difficulty of balancing domestic interests with U.S. demands.
