            <p>Despite President Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations, analysts caution against complacency, citing ongoing trade tensions with China, where tariffs have increased to 125%. This escalation is expected to disrupt global supply chains, potentially causing economic pain for multiple countries. Some analysts suggest the current situation is chaotic and unpredictable, with the possibility of China halting exports altogether, and the overall sentiment suggests a higher tariff world is here to stay. The situation is described as a 'scary moment' for global trade and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An alleged MS-13 leader, Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, is requesting a delay in the dismissal of his case, fearing immediate deportation to El Salvador's CECOT prison without due process. This request comes after the DOJ sought to end the case in favor of deportation, despite Villatoro Santos being charged with illegal firearm possession. Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously publicized his arrest, claiming he was a top leader of MS-13. The defense argues that the defendant risks unlawful deportation and detention in a harsh prison environment.</p>

            <h2>UK TV Industry Faces Funding Crisis, MPs Propose Streaming Levy</h2>

            <p>A group of UK MPs is calling for a streaming levy, suggesting that streaming companies pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences. The Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content. The report noted how "vital" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's "identity, national conversations and talent pipeline", which they say is now "under threat". The report follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms.</p>

            <p>Retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster received an accidental phone call from President Trump, who intended to call South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. Trump, unaware he was speaking to his former national security advisor, launched into a critique of him before realizing the mistake. The call came shortly after Trump had publicly criticized McMaster and after McMaster appeared on "60 Minutes" voicing skepticism about Trump's views on Putin.</p>

His wife, Jennifer Vasquez, insists he is a loving father and has never been convicted of any crime. A judge has ordered the administration to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have fallen as the trade war with the US intensifies, with US President Trump placing a combined 125% in import duties on all Chinese goods. The national consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% year on year last month, reflecting the continued risk posed by deflation to the Chinese economy. The trade war is likely to intensify the downward pressure on prices in the coming months as a decline in American demand leaves Chinese producers with piles of unsold inventory. The Chinese government is likely to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand amid the escalating trade war.</p>

A United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites was set to lift off from a launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, but ULA said it couldn't continue countdown operations as "stubborn cumulus clouds" and heavy winds pushed the launch outside its planned window. Amazon is racing to compete with SpaceX's Starlink, with the company aiming to sell high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is being accused of using 35 methane gas burning turbines to power its supercomputer in Memphis without proper permits. The Southern Environmental Law Center claims these generators are a “major source of air pollution” and violate the Clean Air Act. The group says these gas turbines combined can generate around 420MW of electricity, enough to power an entire city, and are causing harm to nearby communities, which already experience higher rates of cancer and asthma.</p>

The judge found that Dominion presented clear and convincing evidence that Newsmax broadcast segments with inaccurate information that would likely cause reasonable viewers to think significantly less favorably about Dominion. The lawsuit is set to go to trial later this month, where the jury will decide whether to award damages and how much, and whether the broadcasts were aired with "actual malice."</p>
