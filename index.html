          <p>European stock markets opened with losses on Thursday as the financial world anticipates the release of the latest U.S. jobs data. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell, with most sectors experiencing declines. A notable exception was the retail sector, buoyed by fashion giant H&M, whose shares soared over 9% after its third-quarter earnings surpassed expectations. The forthcoming American labor statistics are particularly significant, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that a cooling labor market could pave the way for an interest rate cut. Meanwhile, consumer confidence reports from France and Germany presented a mixed picture of the continent's economic sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes both closed at record highs on Thursday, continuing a multi-session winning streak. This performance contrasted with a mixed trading day across the broader Asia-Pacific region, which did not follow Wall Street's recent downturn in tech stocks like Nvidia. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index saw gains, partly driven by a successful market debut for automaker Chery and a surge in Xiaomi shares following new product announcements. Conversely, markets in South Korea and Taiwan experienced slight retreats, with investors closely watching corporate developments and the potential influence of U.S. economic data on global monetary policy.

          <p>The Co-op has quantified the initial financial damage from a significant cyber-attack earlier this year, revealing at least £206 million in lost revenue. The security breach in April disrupted IT networks, causing payment issues, product shortages, and the theft of data belonging to all 6.5 million of its members. This incident contributed heavily to the retailer reporting an underlying pre-tax loss of £75 million for the first half of the year, a stark reversal from a £3 million profit during the same period last year. The company acknowledged that the full financial impact is not yet known and stressed the need to rebuild its systems to be stronger against future threats.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has revealed that he has been privately encouraged by Labour MPs to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. In an interview, Burnham did not rule out a future leadership bid, stating his previous attempts show his ambition, though he insisted he is not actively plotting a return to Westminster. The comments have created friction within the party, with some colleagues dismissing the talk as unhelpful "tittle tattle" and emphasizing the need for unity after a major election victory. Burnham's remarks, which also criticized a perceived "climate of fear" in the government, are seen by many as positioning for a potential challenge ahead of the party's autumn conference.</p>

          <p>A national crisis is unfolding for disabled children in the UK, as thousands face long waits for essential wheelchairs. Whizz Kids, the country's leading charity providing specialized wheelchairs, has been forced to close its services to new referrals for the first time in its 35-year history due to an overwhelming surge in demand. The charity reports that this pressure is exacerbated by an increasing number of rejections from the NHS, which is struggling with its own budget constraints, leaving families with nowhere else to turn. This systemic failure means many children are left without mobility, impacting their independence, causing physical pain, and preventing them from participating in their childhoods.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Ragasa has left a significant trail of death and destruction after sweeping through the Philippines, Taiwan, and southern China, killing at least 25 people. The storm, which was downgraded from a super typhoon, brought intense winds and flooding, causing a deadly lake burst in Taiwan and widespread power outages in China's Guangdong province. Hong Kong experienced major disruptions, with over 1,000 flight cancellations and significant coastal flooding. As cleanup efforts begin in the affected regions, the weakened storm is now moving west towards Vietnam, where authorities are making urgent preparations for its arrival. A separate storm system is also being monitored as it approaches the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Dan Pembroke, a two-time Paralympic and world champion in the F13 javelin, has found a unique way to visualize his athletic goals: brewing beer. Before his gold-medal victory in Paris, he created a home brew called 'Paris Gold' as a form of manifestation, a practice encouraged by his coach. This hobby has now grown into a commercial venture with a craft brewery. Pembroke, who came to Para-sport after an injury ended his Olympic dream and his eyesight deteriorated, recently broke the world record in his event. Now, as he prepares to defend his world title, he is also brewing a new beer to inspire British athletes at the upcoming Winter Paralympics and looking forward to becoming a father.</p>

Ms. Zavada's body was found by a road in Barcelona in 2005, and police considered her death suspicious. The breakthrough came after her fingerprints, shared through the campaign, were matched by Turkish police to a national database, and a DNA match was later confirmed with a relative in Russia.

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News contends that the Democratic party is missing a political opportunity by allowing its most prominent voices to be figures perceived as far-left, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The author argues that the party's focus on progressive social issues alienates mainstream American voters. The piece criticizes Mamdani's past socialist rhetoric and Ocasio-Cortez's condemnation of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk as examples of a political philosophy that is out of touch with the broader electorate. The author suggests that figures like these give Republicans an advantage by portraying the entire Democratic party as extremist.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to companies in Jaguar Land Rover's supply chain following a cyber-attack that has halted the carmaker's production. The attack forced JLR to shut down its IT networks, and its factories are not expected to resume operations until October at the earliest, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week. There are growing concerns that smaller suppliers, who depend heavily on JLR, could face bankruptcy due to the prolonged shutdown. One potential solution being considered is for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts from these suppliers to ensure their viability until JLR's production lines are restored.</p>

The case has been marked by dramatic turns, including the recent death of the key accuser, who had previously retracted and then reaffirmed his testimony. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, and his 11 co-defendants, including former top aides, all deny the charges. He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Talk of forming a NATO-style defense alliance among Islamic and Arab nations has gained momentum following a recent Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar. The attack, which targeted Hamas members, has reportedly shaken the assumption among Gulf states that their ties with the U.S. guarantee their security. In response, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have agreed to activate a joint defense pact, and discussions are emerging around a potential "6+2" security format involving the six GCC states plus Turkey and Egypt. While a formal, binding alliance like NATO is considered unrealistic, the move signals a growing determination in the region to achieve greater strategic autonomy and hedge against dependency on the U.S.</p>

          <p>Shares of Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China's largest drugmaker by market value, rose after the company announced its fifth drug-licensing deal of 2024. The agreement grants Indian partner Glenmark the right to develop and commercialize Hengrui's cancer drug, trastuzumab rezetecan, in India and other emerging markets. This deal is part of Hengrui's broader strategy to use international partnerships to bring its domestically developed drugs to a global audience. Under the terms, Glenmark will make an upfront payment of $18 million, with potential future payments of up to $1.1 billion contingent on meeting specific regulatory and commercial milestones.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned recent U.S. airstrikes against suspected drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, labeling them an "act of tyranny" and tantamount to murder. The strikes, which the Trump administration justifies as necessary to combat the flow of fentanyl, have reportedly killed 17 people. In an interview with the BBC, Petro questioned the necessity of lethal force, arguing that the boats could simply be intercepted and the crews arrested, as has been done for years in collaboration with U.S. agencies. He called for criminal proceedings against U.S. officials if investigations confirm that Colombian citizens were among those killed in the attacks.</p>

Lula is advocating for the United Nations to lead a contact group to facilitate these talks, a proposal he previously made to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of a "triple sabotage" during his visit to the United Nations, citing three separate technical failures. In a social media post, he detailed how an escalator he was on came to an abrupt halt, his teleprompter failed during his speech to the General Assembly, and the sound system in the auditorium was apparently off. Trump dismissed the incidents as a coincidence and demanded an immediate investigation by the UN Secretary-General. UN officials have offered more mundane explanations, suggesting the escalator's safety stop was hit accidentally and noting the sound system was designed for use with translation earpieces.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated a significant shift in its strategy for a potential government shutdown, suggesting it could use a funding lapse to permanently eliminate some federal jobs. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget instructed agency heads to identify programs "not consistent with the president's priorities" for potential "reduction in force" (RIF) notices. This approach differs sharply from past shutdowns, where employees were temporarily furloughed without pay. The move is seen as a hardball tactic in the ongoing budget negotiations with Democrats, who have called the threat an attempt at intimidation designed to pressure them into passing a funding bill without their own priorities included.</p>

Currently located northeast of the Leeward Islands, the storm is the eighth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season and is moving in a west-northwest direction. Forecasters expect Humberto to undergo steady strengthening over the next several days due to favorable environmental conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures. In addition to Humberto, officials are also closely monitoring a second weather system in the northeast Caribbean that has a high chance of developing into a tropical depression later this week, potentially impacting Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated broad national security investigations into a range of imported goods, including robotics, industrial machinery, and numerous medical devices. These probes, conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, could lead to the imposition of new tariffs on these products. The investigations cover items from surgical masks and syringes to wheelchairs and pacemakers, assessing whether reliance on foreign supply chains poses a threat to U.S. national security. This move expands the administration's use of tariffs as a tool to encourage domestic production and follows similar actions taken against steel, aluminum, and automobiles, potentially raising costs for manufacturers, hospitals, and consumers.

The potential indictment comes amid intense political pressure, as President Trump recently urged for justice to be served and replaced the interim U.S. Attorney in the relevant district with one of his former personal lawyers.

The states, many of which have "sanctuary" policies limiting local police cooperation with ICE, claimed the policy was illegal and jeopardized public safety.

The up to $100 billion deal is structured to be paid out as new AI supercomputing facilities become operational.

This boom is fueled by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's major project in South Africa.
