          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Reform UK, stating their political agenda would "tear this country apart." He specifically highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as one of the most "shocking" policies, which would affect hundreds of thousands of long-term residents contributing to British society. Arriving at the Labour party conference in Liverpool, Starmer positioned his party as the alternative to the "toxic divide and decline" offered by Reform, amidst polling pressure and internal party challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has convened hundreds of top military leaders in Washington for a meeting whose purpose remains unclear, raising security concerns due to the high concentration of senior officials. This unprecedented gathering has drawn scrutiny, with analysts suggesting it may be an effort to communicate the administration's expectations to the military command. Concurrently, Hegseth has introduced new restrictions on journalistic access at the Pentagon, a move that critics argue will hinder transparency and prevent public understanding of such significant military meetings.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve was ejected from a playoff game against the Phoenix Mercury after a furious reaction to what she perceived as a missed foul call that resulted in an injury to star player Napheesa Collier. In a post-game press conference, Reeve bypassed questions and delivered a powerful critique of the league's officiating, calling for a change in leadership and describing the officiating crew's performance as "malpractice." The incident adds to a season-long debate among WNBA coaches and players about inconsistent and overly physical officiating in the league.</p>

Nuno, who was recently let go by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to a high league finish last season, is tasked with immediately improving the team's performance and league standing, with his first match against Everton.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II, breaking racial barriers as part of the first group of Black military aviators in the U.S. armed forces. Hardy's distinguished career also included combat missions in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and he later became a champion for preserving the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data suggests that a resilient stock market is bolstering consumer spending, potentially keeping the U.S. economy from entering a recession. This "wealth effect" primarily benefits the top 10% of earners who own the vast majority of stocks, creating a disconnect with broader consumer sentiment, which has been declining. While indicators like consumer spending and GDP growth appear strong, economists warn that this strength is precarious and highly dependent on market stability. A downturn in the stock market could quickly trigger a recession, as there is little job growth to otherwise support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Fading West recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in just two months for residents displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires, showcasing modular construction's potential for both disaster relief and addressing the nationwide housing shortage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently made several claims about the strength of the U.S. economy, many of which are contradicted by federal data. While he correctly stated that gasoline and mortgage rates have decreased slightly over the past year, his assertions that energy and grocery prices are down are inaccurate, as both have seen increases. Furthermore, his declaration that inflation has been "defeated" is premature, with the Consumer Price Index still above the Federal Reserve's target and showing signs of re-acceleration. The stock market has reached record highs, but manufacturing has seen job losses despite a recent uptick in factory production. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system designed to give pilots more time to react to hazards. The system provides automated audio and visual warnings if another aircraft is on the runway during takeoff or landing, potentially adding crucial seconds for evasive action. With serious close calls at U.S. airports peaking in 2023, safety experts and regulators are urging wider adoption of such technologies to enhance the layers of safety in an increasingly congested aviation system.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis are spearheading a movement against AI-generated pornography after discovering their social media photos were used without consent to create explicit deepfakes on a "nudify" website. The case highlights a significant legal loophole, as the creation of such content for personal use is not explicitly illegal in many jurisdictions, leaving victims with little recourse. This incident has prompted legislative action in Minnesota, aiming to hold AI companies accountable and criminalize the generation of nonconsensual explicit deepfakes, reflecting a growing national concern over the misuse of generative AI technology.</p>

          <p>Broadcast media companies Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their local ABC affiliate stations. The companies had pulled the program after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr suggested regulatory action could be taken against affiliates over Kimmel's comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk. However, the boycott proved more costly for the stations, which lost significant viewership by replacing the popular late-night show with local programming. The quick reversal demonstrates that despite the growing power of consolidated station groups, major networks like ABC still hold significant leverage.</p>

Goldberger, who is Jewish, reiterates the core principle that free speech must be protected even when it is offensive.

          <p>The recent federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey for making false statements to Congress is being scrutinized by legal experts, who suggest the case may be vulnerable to dismissal. They argue that President Trump's long history of public attacks against Comey, coupled with his celebratory comments following the indictment, provides strong evidence for a defense motion based on selective or vindictive prosecution. Further complicating the case is the abrupt replacement of the top prosecutor in the prosecuting office with a Trump loyalist just days before the charges were filed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, intended to encourage hiring American workers, is being criticized by economists for its potential negative impact on the U.S. economy. Britta Glennon, an economist at the Wharton School, argues that the policy will constrain the use of the program and hurt innovation, as skilled immigrants are highly entrepreneurial and make American counterparts more innovative. Research suggests that restricting H-1B visas often leads U.S. companies to offshore jobs rather than hire domestically, undermining the policy's stated goal. (not investment advice)</p>

While forecasts suggest Humberto will not make landfall, its potential interaction with the second system, likely to be named Imelda, adds a layer of uncertainty as both storms could influence weather patterns along the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

The author argues that the memoir highlights Harris's timidity and indecisiveness, such as her choice of a vice-presidential candidate, and fails to grapple with why her campaign struggled to connect with key voter demographics.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, prominent figures in the Trump administration and the Christian right are framing the political landscape as a "spiritual war" against evil. This language reflects the growing influence of the New Apostolic Reformation, a charismatic Christian movement that views politics as a cosmic battle and believes God has anointed leaders like Donald Trump to establish dominion over society. At Kirk's memorial, speakers described him as the "first martyr of the third Great Awakening," urging followers to combat demonic forces they associate with their political opponents.</p>
