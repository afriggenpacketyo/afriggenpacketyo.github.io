          <p>Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has dismissed any possibility of renewed dialogue with South Korea, refuting claims that Pyongyang had removed propaganda loudspeakers from the border. She asserted that North Korea has no intention of improving relations and views upcoming U.S.-South Korea military drills as proof of their hostile intentions. This response cools recent hopes from Seoul after South Korea had taken similar de-escalation measures, with Kim Yo Jong stating this anti-dialogue stance will eventually be enshrined in the nation's constitution.</p>

Lai, a British citizen and founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces under a Beijing-imposed law. The case is viewed by critics as a key indicator of eroding freedoms and the weaponization of the legal system in Hong Kong, drawing international calls for his release.</p>

Biden alleged that Epstein had introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim her lawyer has labeled as false, defamatory, and damaging to her reputation. The Trumps have long maintained they were introduced at a New York Fashion Week party in 1998, not by Epstein.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported a significant increase in cases of the chikungunya virus, with over 70 infections in the first half of the year, more than double the previous year's count.

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move could soon lead to the seizure of all company property, including the Infowars brand name itself, and may signal the end of Alex Jones's broadcast under that banner. The families' lawyers praised the decision as a long-awaited step toward accountability for Jones's false and cruel conspiracies about the 2012 school shooting.</p>

          <p>Small businesses, particularly coffee shops and specialty tea importers, are facing significant financial pressure as U.S. tariffs contribute to rising commodity prices. In July, coffee prices surged 14.5% year-over-year, forcing retailers to pass costs onto consumers or absorb losses on already thin margins. Importers of goods like single-origin teas and spices, which cannot be sourced domestically, argue the tariffs disproportionately harm American small businesses rather than their intended foreign targets.

          <p>A large-scale study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that medication for ADHD can significantly reduce the risks of adverse life events for newly diagnosed individuals. The research, which followed over 148,000 people in Sweden, found that taking ADHD medication was linked to lower rates of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. Researchers believe the drugs help manage impulsivity and inattention, leading to these wider behavioral benefits beyond just addressing core symptoms.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization has sparked significant controversy, leading to the arrest of over 700 protesters for showing support. The ban, which was prompted by what officials describe as millions of pounds in criminal damage, is now facing three key legal battles. These include the prosecution of the arrested supporters, the criminal trials of alleged group members for property damage, and a High Court challenge to the legality and proportionality of the ban itself.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs aimed at curbing China's shipbuilding dominance, South Korean firms are expanding their operations into Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. Companies such as HD Hyundai are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to revive shipyards in the region, seeking to leverage lower labor costs and increase capacity. This strategic shift is seen as a way for South Korean shipbuilders to enhance their competitiveness against Chinese rivals, though analysts note it will take time to develop a skilled local workforce.

          <p>The government of Nova Scotia is facing criticism for implementing a sweeping ban on all activity in wooded areas, including hiking and fishing, to mitigate extreme wildfire risk. The restrictions, which come with a hefty C$25,000 fine for violators, have been called "draconian" by a civil liberties group. However, provincial officials defend the ban as a necessary precaution in a "tinder box" environment, noting that nearly all wildfires in the province are human-caused and conditions remain dangerously dry.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the payment app Zelle, which is co-owned by seven major U.S. banks.

The lawsuit claims that known design flaws in the network made it highly susceptible to fraud, causing "catastrophic harm" to millions of users.</p>
