          <h2>Trump-Aligned Legal Group Challenges Federal Hiring Practices Favoring Diversity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:30:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>America First Legal Foundation (AFL), a legal group aligned with former President Trump, is challenging a 1981 consent decree that ended merit-based hiring for federal jobs in favor of alternative assessments aimed at promoting diversity. AFL argues that the Luevano consent decree, agreed upon during President Carter's administration, results in less qualified candidates being hired. The lawsuit aims to restore merit-based evaluations, asserting that race and immutable traits should not be considered in the hiring process. The Office of Personnel Management has also sought to end the Carter-era system, potentially signaling broad support for merit-based hiring. This legal challenge could reignite debate over race-conscious hiring practices within the federal government.</p>

          <p>A fire in a three-story building near the Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India, resulted in the deaths of 17 people and several injuries. The fire, reportedly caused by a short circuit on the ground floor where a jewelry store was located, trapped residents living above. The narrow staircase and single exit made escape difficult, according to fire services. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced financial compensation for the victims' families. Fires are common in India due to builders and residents often flouting building laws and safety norms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a dramatic decrease in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, linked to the widespread availability of a maternal vaccine and a monoclonal antibody treatment. Hospitalizations have fallen by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have observed fewer critically ill children and a reduced need for intensive care. The study suggests that the increased use of RSV prevention products could lead to even larger reductions in hospitalizations among infants in future seasons.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how President Trump's actions, such as considering accepting a Qatari jet, conflict with the Constitution's anti-corruption provisions. The author argues that the Founders feared undue influence from gifts and emoluments, leading to explicit prohibitions on presidential profiteering. The article highlights the emoluments clauses, which restrict the president from receiving gifts or emoluments from the U.S. or foreign states without congressional consent. The author laments the lack of congressional oversight and judicial enforcement, leaving the nation vulnerable to potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Haas F1 team has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix. The team believes Bearman completed his lap before the red flag, which was triggered by a crash, invalidating his time. Despite video and live-timing data suggesting Bearman crossed the line before the red flag, the FIA upheld its original decision. The team is seeking clarification and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, potentially revolutionizing treatment for debilitating bladder conditions. The procedure was performed on a 41-year-old man with reduced bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. Doctors plan to conduct further transplants as part of a clinical trial to assess outcomes and complications. While traditional bladder removal often involves repurposing bowel tissue, which can lead to complications, a bladder transplant offers a potentially cleaner solution.</p>
