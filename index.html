          <p>Global stock markets experienced a sharp decline following the implementation of new tariffs by the Trump administration, raising concerns about a potential global trade war and its economic impact. Asian markets led the downturn, with significant losses in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, followed by similar declines in European markets. The tariffs, which include levies on U.S. imports and retaliatory measures from China, have surprised investors and triggered fears of increased inflation and reduced consumer spending. Some analysts predict the Trump administration may ease tariffs in the future, while others warn of further escalation and economic decoupling. (not investment advice)

          <p>China has retaliated strongly against the latest U.S. tariffs, increasing the risk of an intense trade war between the two economic giants. Beijing's response includes imposing 34% tariffs on all U.S. goods and placing export curbs on rare earth elements, signaling a determination to match U.S. actions. Analysts suggest this aggressive posture could lead to further escalation and potential decoupling of commercial ties. Morgan Stanley estimates that the tariffs could significantly impact China's economic growth, potentially slowing it by 1.5 to 2 percentage points this year. (not investment advice)

          <p>A recent WHO report reveals a dire situation in maternal healthcare, with one woman dying every two minutes due to failures in care, totaling 260,000 deaths in 2023. The report warns that the UN's goal to reduce maternal deaths by 2030 will be missed by a significant margin, with progress stagnating. Cuts to international aid from the US and UK are exacerbating the crisis, potentially reversing progress made in reducing maternal mortality rates. Sub-Saharan Africa and India account for the highest death rates, highlighting inequalities in access to quality healthcare.</p>

          <p>The UK government has relaxed electric vehicle (EV) sales targets for car manufacturers in response to tariffs imposed by the U.S., providing more flexibility and lower fines. The move aims to support the UK car industry, which faces a 25% levy on car exports to the U.S. and a 10% tariff on UK imports. While a ban on new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect for 2030, manufacturers will have more leeway in meeting annual targets. Opposition parties have criticized the measures as insufficient to protect the sector.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has criticized President Trump's tariff policies, warning that they are leading America towards an "economic nuclear winter" by destroying confidence in the country as a trading partner. Ackman, who previously endorsed Trump, argues that the tariffs are hurting low-income consumers and causing business leaders to lose faith in the president's economic policies. He suggests that Trump should call for a timeout to negotiate fairer trade deals or risk severe negative consequences for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)

          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S., China's central bank is prioritizing yuan stability over devaluation. The People's Bank of China has set the yuan's daily reference rate to a four-month low, but it remains above the critical 7.2 benchmark, signaling an intention to stabilize the currency. Analysts believe this approach reflects a desire to avoid a sharp devaluation that could offset the impact of U.S. tariffs, and expect the central bank to maintain this strategy unless further tariffs are announced.

          <p>The UK government is considering its response to the global economic turmoil caused by US tariffs, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer weighing the options of retaliation or restraint. While retaliation could prove popular domestically and align with other G7 nations, it could also harm UK consumers and jeopardize EU relations. Choosing restraint, on the other hand, could allow the UK to pursue a favorable trade deal with the US and position itself for future economic growth, but it carries the risk of appearing weak and appeasing a bully.</p>
