          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, is demonstrating remarkable success in treating Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. La Bodega, a clinic at Erie County Medical Center, employs a model that provides diagnosis and treatment in a single visit, curing about 98% of its more than 7,000 patients. This approach contrasts with the slow national progress in treating the disease, despite curative drugs being available for over a decade. The clinic's success, which significantly reduces long-term medical costs, is now inspiring a bipartisan federal bill aimed at eliminating Hepatitis C nationwide.</p>

          <p>ESPN is reportedly finalizing a major deal with the National Football League to acquire key media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular RedZone channel. In exchange for these assets, the NFL would receive an equity stake in ESPN potentially worth billions of dollars, estimated to be as high as 10%. The agreement, which would also grant ESPN more regular-season games and access to the NFL's fantasy football operations, is expected to be announced soon. This strategic partnership comes as ESPN prepares to launch its direct-to-consumer streaming service and would require regulatory approval before completion.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board held a three-day hearing to investigate the fatal midair collision over Washington, D.C., which killed all 67 people aboard an Army helicopter and a passenger plane. Testimony revealed significant discrepancies in the helicopter's altitude readings, which the Army considered within an acceptable margin of error, frustrating investigators. The inquiry also uncovered that the helicopter crew missed a critical air traffic control command to pass behind the airliner. Furthermore, the FAA acknowledged its controller failed to issue a necessary traffic advisory to the plane's pilots, who were aware of the impending impact just seconds before it occurred.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of a significant slowdown as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below economists' forecasts, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.2%. The report's weakness was compounded by major downward revisions for May and June, which erased a combined 258,000 previously reported jobs. Analysts suggest the disappointing figures reflect the economic impact of escalating trade tensions and new tariffs, increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut. The data highlights a downshifting economy, with some experts predicting further weakness in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that he ordered two nuclear-capable submarines to be moved to "appropriate regions" in response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move followed a social media post where Medvedev warned that a U.S. ultimatum regarding the Ukraine conflict was a step towards war. Trump stated the submarine deployment was a precautionary measure, expressing hope that the situation would not escalate. This action represents a rhetorical heightening of tensions with Moscow, though security analysts note the U.S. already has nuclear submarines deployed globally.</p>

This development occurs amid ongoing scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and Maxwell's recent transfer to a new prison facility.</p>

          <p>Soldiers returning from the frontlines in Ukraine are experiencing a unique form of psychological trauma, dubbed "droneophobia," triggered by the constant, high-pitched whine of FPV drones. This pervasive sound, which signals a hunt by bomb-laden drones, has become a source of acute stress, with everyday noises like lawnmowers or air conditioners causing panic. Military psychiatrists report a surge in mental health injuries directly related to drone activity, as the nature of warfare shifts. The psychological terror extends beyond the battlefield, as Russia has also begun using FPV drones to target civilians in Ukrainian cities, transforming ordinary sounds into a daily source of fear.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate successfully advanced a package of three government spending bills late Friday, breaking a partisan stalemate and taking a crucial step toward avoiding a potential government shutdown. The bills, which fund military construction, veterans' affairs, agriculture, the FDA, and the legislative branch, passed after leaders found a path forward despite various roadblocks. This marks the first time since 2018 that the chamber has passed appropriations bills before September. The legislation now moves to the House, where it faces resistance from Republicans who object to the spending levels, setting the stage for further negotiations ahead of the September 30 funding deadline.</p>

          <p>India and China are showing signs of a diplomatic thaw after years of heightened tensions following a deadly border clash. New Delhi recently resumed issuing visas to Chinese citizens, a move Beijing welcomed, which followed China's decision to allow Indian pilgrims back into Tibet. Direct flights between the two nations, suspended during the pandemic, are also expected to resume soon. These measures suggest a potential move past the deep-seated mistrust that has defined their relationship. However, analysts caution that the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle to a full normalization of ties between the two Asian powers.</p>

Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, was also barred from holding public office and fined. The conviction stems from a long-running case where he was accused of manipulating witnesses, including former paramilitary members, to testify in his favor. Uribe maintains his innocence, claiming the case is politically motivated, and has stated he will appeal the verdict.</p>

The lawsuit argues the White House and Justice Department are using threats of criminal prosecution and demands for private patient data to create a de facto national ban on such care. This federal pressure has led several prominent children's hospitals to close their gender clinics, even in states where the care is legal, creating an atmosphere of fear and forcing families to travel farther for essential healthcare.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that significantly narrows the path for millions of motorists to claim compensation over mis-sold car finance deals. The court decided not to uphold a finding that hidden commission payments to dealers were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment left open the possibility for individual claims based on unfairness, particularly in cases involving large, undisclosed commissions. This decision greatly reduces the potential liability for lenders, which was once estimated to be as high as £30 billion, though it still allows for some consumers to pursue compensation on different legal grounds.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece in The Atlantic frames President Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner as part of a long-standing "war with numbers." The author argues that this move, following a negative jobs report, is an attempt to discard data that does not align with a desired political narrative. By attacking the credibility of nonpartisan government statisticians, the administration risks shaking market confidence and making it harder to address real economic problems. The article suggests this action aims to create a fog of misinformation where feelings and political loyalty replace objective facts, leaving everyone to navigate in the dark.</p>

          <p>A psychotherapist who was once in a religious cult for seven years is now helping others recognize and recover from similar experiences. Gillie Jenkinson, featured in a BBC documentary, explains that cults use coercive control and manipulation tactics like "love bombing" to gain power over individuals. She notes that these groups often promise simple answers to life's complex problems and create an "us-versus-them" mentality. Key red flags include isolating members, controlling their behavior, and establishing a high barrier to exit, making people fear losing their identity or facing retaliation if they try to leave.</p>

Other major companies on the docket include Disney, whose streaming and theme park segments are showing strength, and McDonald's, which Cramer views as a buy at current levels. The week will also feature results from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, providing insight into the market for its popular weight loss drugs, and industrial bellwether Caterpillar.

          <p>At an internal meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. The Beijing-based company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin, shared the data to counter online speculation that its average staff tenure was much shorter. According to sources at the town hall, about half of the firm's 120,000 employees have been with the company for over three years. These figures suggest that ByteDance has a relatively stable workforce compared to the high turnover rates often seen in China's demanding tech industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus.

After the repossession, Tiah McCreary discovered that Taylor Kia of Lima had failed to renew its business trade name with the state. Seizing the opportunity, she registered the name for herself and then sued the dealership for fraud and for using what was now legally her trade name. An appeals court recently sided with McCreary, ruling that the trade name dispute is a separate issue from the car purchase and can be heard in court.</p>

Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap casualty after 11 seasons with the Chargers. The potential signing makes sense for Los Angeles, which is in need of an experienced receiver following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. A return would reunite Allen with quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he had a productive on-field partnership for several seasons.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has signaled that it may declare President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship unconstitutional, expressing deep skepticism during a hearing. Judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit and multiple lower courts that have blocked the order. The case will likely be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, which has long been understood to guarantee birthright citizenship.</p>

          <p>An analytical article in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's social media post about moving nuclear submarines is a reckless and dangerous act, primarily serving as a political distraction. The author contends that Trump is using the implied threat of nuclear war to deflect from a week of bad news, including economic concerns and the Epstein controversy. This behavior breaks with the precedent set by past presidents, who treated any mention of nuclear weapons with extreme gravity. While the threat itself may be empty, it sets a dangerous new standard for presidential conduct and risks being taken seriously by adversaries in the future.</p>
