          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and accelerated nuclear arms race, heightened by Russia's formal withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The author points to Vladimir Putin's repeated nuclear threats, the development of hypersonic missiles, and a reciprocal military buildup by NATO as evidence of a dangerous escalation. The piece laments the public's silence on the issue, contrasting it with the widespread anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, and calls for an urgent halt to the growing global insecurity.</p>

The article provides a first-person account of the dangers faced, the methods used to build a cover story, and a tense meeting with a senior gang member in a secret forest camp near Dunkirk.</p>

Authorities have limited information about the suspect or the motive behind the attack. The incident occurred as local residents were enjoying a meal of crabs near the intersection of Spaulding and Queensberry Avenues.</p>

          <p>Despite Germany's efforts to integrate refugees, women face a threefold disadvantage in the job market due to their gender, immigrant status, and refugee experience. The article highlights that two-thirds of female refugees remain unemployed after eight years, compared to just 15% of men, with primary obstacles being a lack of childcare, difficulties in getting foreign qualifications recognized, and language barriers. Through personal stories and expert analysis, the piece explores the systemic challenges and the nonprofit projects working to help women overcome them and find meaningful work.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace talks must involve Ukraine. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others emphasized that Ukraine's borders cannot be changed by force and that Kyiv must have a say in its own destiny. The unified message comes amid concerns that Trump might negotiate a deal directly with Putin, potentially involving territorial concessions, without Ukraine's consent or participation.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell showcased a formidable return from injury, striking out ten batters in five scoreless innings during a 9-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. The two-time Cy Young winner's performance, along with a 40th season home run from Shohei Ohtani, signals that the Dodgers' envisioned top-tier starting rotation is finally materializing. After a four-month recovery from shoulder inflammation, Snell's successful outing contributes to the team's strengthening pitching staff as they head deeper into the season.</p>

          <p>A new six-part documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been aired by a provincial broadcaster in China to reinforce Beijing's historical narrative regarding the western region. The series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, aiming to counter what China views as hostile Western perspectives and to foster a unified national identity. This media initiative aligns with President Xi Jinping's long-standing goal of forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation by controlling the historical accounts of its borderlands.</p>
