          <p>Japan's ambassador to China, Kenji Kanasugi, emphasized the need for China and Japan to improve public opinion towards each other, particularly amid concerns about tariffs imposed by the U.S. Ambassador Kanasugi highlighted lingering negative perceptions in both countries and the challenges in quickly remedying the situation, urging steady progress through addressing concrete challenges and promoting practical cooperation. He also noted that tourism between the two countries has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with some Japanese citizens feeling anxious about visiting China due to various reasons. The ambassador stated that Japan continues to raise these issues with the Chinese government, as relations remain complicated by historical issues, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood. </p>

          <p>Serious disorder broke out in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, for a second night, with fireworks, petrol bombs, and other projectiles thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The unrest, described by police as "racist thuggery," followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in the town, with tensions rising due to concerns about immigration. Homes and businesses were attacked, with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationality, and local politicians have condemned the violence, fearing potential fatalities. The Prime Minister's office described the events as "very concerning," and the Northern Ireland Secretary emphasized that there is "no justification" for the rioting. </p>

          <p>Thousands of Austrians gathered for a candlelight vigil in Graz to mourn the 10 victims of a school shooting, the deadliest in the country's recent history. The 21-year-old suspect, a former student, took his own life after the attack, and authorities found a "farewell letter" and a non-functional pipe bomb at his home. The shooting occurred at DreierschÃ¼tzengasse secondary school, leaving 12 others injured, and prompted a declaration of three days of mourning in Austria. The event has deeply shaken the community, with many expressing solidarity and grief, and the school will remain closed until further notice. </p>

          <p>A curfew was implemented in downtown Los Angeles after five nights of unrest sparked by immigration operations, which also led to the deployment of National Guard and U.S. Marines troops. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized President Trump's deployment of troops, calling it an abuse of power that inflamed the situation, while Mayor Karen Bass cited escalating violence and looting as the reason for the curfew. Protests began after immigration raids in several downtown locations, resulting in numerous arrests and clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Demonstrations continued, with protesters briefly entering the 101 Freeway and tensions escalating near the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. </p>

          <p>Nintendo sold over 3.5 million units of its Switch 2 gaming system in the four days following its launch, causing major U.S. retailers to display "out of stock" signs. This record-breaking start, the company's first new console in eight years, puts Nintendo on track to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Analysts predict that initial demand will remain strong, with some forecasting over 20 million units sold in the first 12 months. The Switch 2, released on June 5, has been met with enthusiasm, and Nintendo of America's president expressed gratitude for the positive response. </p>

Trump's travel ban could prevent some fans from attending, although exceptions may be made for athletes and their families. Despite these challenges, some believe that Trump will want to put on a good show to enhance his own reputation, and the leaders of Canada and Mexico may stand up to Trump's policies. </p>

          <p>Asia's move away from the U.S. dollar is gaining momentum due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with countries seeking to reduce reliance on the greenback. The U.S. dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves has declined, and its use as leverage in trade negotiations has prompted a reevaluation of portfolios. ASEAN is promoting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while BRICS nations are developing their own payment systems to bypass traditional systems. Asian economies with large foreign assets, such as Singapore, South Korea, and China, have the greatest potential to repatriate earnings to their home currencies. (not investment advice) </p>

Speaking at a U.N. event on disability rights in New York, Kita described the incident as a "painful secret" he kept from his wife until her death. The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses without consent. Kita is a member of a group that won compensation from the government in a Supreme Court ruling last year, and he hopes to reduce the number of people who suffer as he did. </p>

The skills that employers seek are changing much faster in AI-exposed occupations, emphasizing current abilities over past studies. This shift may democratize opportunities by opening doors for those without formal degrees, and individuals can adapt by upskilling in AI.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane", testified in his federal trial for sex crimes, describing his alleged "sexual deviant" behavior. While her testimony provided insight into Diddy's personal life, legal experts suggest it may not strengthen the prosecution's case on the specific charges he faces. The case hinges on coercion versus consent, and the defense is suggesting that Jane willingly participated in the alleged acts. Experts believe the testimony could portray Combs as morally reprehensible but may not prove he broke the laws he is charged with violating. </p>
