          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Donald Trump held a 15-minute meeting inside St Peter's Basilica before Pope Francis' funeral, described by the White House as "very productive." The two leaders were seen in deep discussion, against the backdrop of the Pope's funeral, with a Ukrainian spokesperson indicating a second meeting would occur later on Saturday.

          <p>The annual White House Correspondents' Dinner faces a somber atmosphere this year, with President Trump boycotting and the comedian's invitation withdrawn. The event, traditionally a mix of humor and politics, is expected to focus on awarding journalists and providing scholarships, but critics view the subdued tone as a sign of media capitulation to Trump's attacks. The dinner's diminished glamour and lack of entertainer reflect a broader sense of unease and challenges facing the media in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Cocaine use is rapidly increasing in Germany, spreading beyond the wealthy to all social classes, driven by a saturated North American market and a decline in heroin availability. The shift is causing concern among authorities due to health risks and the involvement of drug cartels. Legalizing cannabis may have also contributed to the rise in cocaine consumption. Law enforcement faces challenges in combating drug trafficking, with ports like Hamburg serving as hubs for smuggling from South America.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Cosplay Cabinet: Performance Over Substance?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article criticizes the Trump administration for prioritizing appearances over substance, with cabinet members engaging in performative displays of their roles. The author argues that these "cosplay" performances distract from the actual work of governing and raise questions about the qualifications of appointees. The piece cites examples of cabinet members posing in various costumes and engaging in activities that seem more about image than substance. The author suggests that this emphasis on image reflects Trump's own background as a performer and his focus on appearances.</p>

          <p>A new study from Durham University reveals that chimpanzees are more empathetic than previously thought, often comforting each other in times of distress. Researchers observed chimpanzees embracing, holding hands, and touching each other, demonstrating a range of comforting behaviors. The study challenges previous notions that bonobos are the only empathic ape and shows that chimpanzees also exhibit compassion and care. The researchers suggest that this new information about chimpanzees could provide additional insights into the evolution of human social behavior.</p>

          <p>A Durham University study has revealed that chimpanzees display empathetic behavior, consoling each other in distress, challenging the perception of them as primarily violent. Researchers found that chimpanzees are as likely to console one another as bonobos, often considered more empathetic. The study, which involved 1,400 hours of observation, found that younger apes were more likely to offer consolation. Both species used similar comforting behaviors, including embracing, hand-holding, and touching, similar to human expressions of empathy.</p>
