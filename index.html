          <p>President Trump ordered the deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over federal immigration enforcement operations. This decision was made without the request of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticized the move as inflammatory and likely to escalate tensions. The protests, triggered by ICE operations, led to clashes between demonstrators and authorities, including a freeway shutdown. The deployment involves 2,000 National Guardsmen and is based on a rarely used provision allowing federal intervention in cases of rebellion, which Newsom disputes.</p>

          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing dismissing it as inadequate. The vote is crucial as it could lead to a strike ballot, following previous industrial action over pay disputes. The RCN argues that nursing has been undervalued, leading to staff shortages and pay erosion. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action, casting a shadow over the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria have weakened Iran's power and influence, according to analysts. The pager operation, which targeted Hezbollah militants, and the subsequent assassination of leader Hassan Nasrallah, dealt significant blows to the organization. The loss of territory in Syria has also cut off a critical supply route for Iran. As a result, Iran's proxy war strategy is failing, prompting a need to review its approach to regional influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK energy firms are being paid substantial sums to curtail power generation due to grid overload, raising concerns about rising energy bills and the government's net zero promise. Wind farms like Moray East and West are sometimes compensated for turning down output when the grid cannot handle the electricity they generate. At the same time, gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity, exacerbating the issue. The government is considering regional pricing to address the inefficiencies, but the plan faces opposition and could lead to higher bills for some consumers.</p>
