          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu experienced a significant career setback, losing his world title rematch against American Sebastian Fundora via a seventh-round technical knockout in Las Vegas. This marks Tszyu's third loss in his last four fights, a stark contrast to his previously undefeated record over 24 professional bouts. The fight saw Tszyu knocked down in the first round and suffer a severe cut, ultimately leading his corner to stop the contest. The defeat places the 30-year-old's career at a critical juncture, with potential considerations for moving up a weight class.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of murdering her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her claim it was a tragic accident stemming from a playful, cartoon-inspired misunderstanding. She alleged that her husband used an Elmer Fudd voice to indicate his gun had "no more buwwets," prompting her to playfully fan-fire the weapon, which discharged twice and killed him. After an initial mistrial where the jury was deadlocked, a second trial resulted in a guilty verdict for second-degree murder. The case highlights the bizarre nature of the defense and the complex legal proceedings that ultimately led to her conviction.</p>

          <h2>Fitbit Data and Google Dashboard Evidence Prove Key in Wisconsin Murder Case</h2>

          <p>In the investigation into the 2016 murder of Wisconsin mother Nicole Vander Heyden, technology played a crucial role in both exonerating a suspect and convicting the killer. Initially, Vander Heyden's boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect until his Fitbit data corroborated his alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify George Steven Burch, whose location data from Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene and where evidence was discarded. This case demonstrates how modern personal technology can provide critical, objective evidence in complex criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable $250 "visa integrity fee" for nonimmigrant visa applicants, including tourists and business travelers, starting in fiscal year 2025. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and a separate, increased Form I-94 fee. While the provision allows for reimbursement if visa holders comply with all conditions, such as not overstaying, the process is unclear and expected to be complex. Travel industry and immigration law experts have noted significant unanswered questions about implementation, advising clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of people reported missing following devastating floods earlier in the month, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, which successfully verified that most of the initially unaccounted-for individuals were safe. At its peak, over 160 people were listed as missing in the county. The update brings a measure of relief to the community, although the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, is facing a catastrophic water crisis and is at risk of becoming the first modern capital city to run out of water, according to a report by Mercy Corps. A combination of rapid population growth, climate change, and groundwater over-extraction has severely depleted the city's water reserves, with nearly half of its boreholes already dry. Residents are forced to pay high prices for water from private tankers, and much of the available groundwater is contaminated, leading to widespread health issues. The crisis is exacerbated by political turmoil and a halt in foreign aid, creating a dire humanitarian emergency.</p>

          <h2>UK Government's 'Great British Energy' School Solar Panels Were Manufactured in China</h2>

          <p>The initial rollout of the UK's "Great British Energy" solar panel scheme for schools used panels manufactured by two Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi, the BBC has learned. The government had promoted the initiative as a major project for a company "owned by the British people." The revelation has drawn criticism due to concerns about supporting Chinese industry over domestic manufacturing and allegations of forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains. In response, a GB Energy spokesperson stated that all contracts complied with UK modern slavery rules and that the company is committed to ensuring ethical supply chains.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of drivers are parking in lay-bys and other unofficial spots near UK airports, like Edinburgh Airport, to avoid paying escalating "kiss-and-fly" drop-off fees. Research from the RAC shows that over half of the country's busiest airports have increased these charges. Drivers wait for their arriving passengers to call and then coordinate a quick pickup in unauthorized areas to circumvent the fees, which they describe as "extortionate" and "greedy." Airports maintain that free drop-off zones are available further from the terminals, but some passengers find them inconvenient.</p>

          <p>In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, a systematic campaign is underway to erase Ukrainian identity and instill pro-Russian ideology in children, starting from nursery school. Through state-sponsored youth groups, a Russian curriculum, and visits from soldiers, children are subjected to militaristic and patriotic education that glorifies Russia's invasion. Thousands of Ukrainian children have also been taken on tours of Russia or forcibly deported to "re-education camps," actions that violate international humanitarian law. This effort represents a key front in the war, targeting the next generation to secure long-term control over the population.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether the traditional six-week school summer holiday should be shortened and redistributed throughout the year. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, valuing the long break for rest and preparation, while some pupils express mixed feelings. Several school districts are already experimenting with a five-week summer and a two-week October half-term, reflecting a potential shift in the academic calendar.</p>

          <p>The soaring global demand for lithium, a key component in batteries for electric cars and renewable energy storage, is creating a severe environmental crisis in places like Chile's Atacama salt flats. The extraction process, which involves pumping vast quantities of brine, is depleting water resources in the already arid region. This has devastated local ecosystems, impacting native flora, flamingo populations, and the livelihoods of indigenous communities. While the world transitions to green energy, these communities question why they must bear the environmental cost, turning one solution for climate change into another ecological problem.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage more people, particularly women, to move savings from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments. The government plans an ad campaign and will have banks send targeted messages to savers, highlighting the potential benefits of investing to boost both individual wealth and the UK economy. While the chancellor has backed away from immediately cutting the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to force this change, the idea remains under consideration. Experts caution that the push must be handled carefully to avoid putting off new investors, especially in volatile markets.</p>

The series notes that while women once lagged in school, they have now surpassed boys in many metrics, with boys of color falling furthest behind. Politically, a significant gap has emerged, driven partly by social media and differing views on social safety nets, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade widening the divide among young voters.
