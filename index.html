          <h2>New 'Fantastic Four' Film Prioritizes High-Stakes Plot Over Character Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:50:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Marvel movie, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," attempts to revitalize the franchise with a retro-futuristic aesthetic and a strong cast. However, the film quickly abandons character-building and the team's unique family dynamic in favor of a massive, world-ending threat from the villain Galactus. While visually impressive and featuring some thrilling sequences, the movie struggles to capture the fun and charm of the original comics. The performances feel muted and the characters underdeveloped, as the script rushes into a somber, high-stakes narrative without establishing the playful chemistry that defines the superhero team.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has confirmed that approximately $6 billion in federal education funding, which had been frozen by the Trump administration, is now being released. A spokesperson stated on Friday that the funds will support a variety of critical education initiatives across the country.

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker, underwent a second day of questioning by Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche in Tallahassee, Florida. Her lawyer stated that Maxwell answered every question truthfully and did not invoke any privileges, covering a wide range of topics related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The meetings occur as Maxwell's legal team prepares an appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her 20-year sentence, arguing it was barred by a prior non-prosecution agreement with Epstein. Her lawyer emphasized this was her first opportunity to answer questions and asserted that no offer of clemency has been made.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her two children, was sentenced to two additional life sentences in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband and her niece's ex-husband. The judge highlighted her profound manipulation and the unparalleled calculation behind her crimes, which prosecutors argued were driven by money, sex, and twisted religious beliefs. During the hearing, emotional victim impact statements from family members detailed the immense pain and destruction she caused. Daybell maintained her innocence, claiming she was a victim of family tragedy and was not given a fair trial.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by the substantial revenue generated from his administration's tariffs. He suggested the payments could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, though specific details were not provided. The administration has collected around $100 billion from tariffs, which could rise significantly. While Trump also mentioned using the funds to pay down the national debt, economists note that recent tax cuts and spending are projected to increase the deficit, making the feasibility of both goals uncertain.

Luther refused Hitler’s massive funding requests for rearmament, offering only a fraction of what was demanded. Ultimately, Hitler used threats of extralegal force to compel Luther's resignation, replacing him with the more compliant Hjalmar Schacht to fund his military ambitions.</p>

          <p>While a typical Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) takes two to six weeks to close, it may be possible to complete the process in under two weeks. Success depends on the lender's efficiency, often favoring online institutions, and the borrower's preparedness with necessary documents like tax returns and pay stubs. A key factor in speeding up the timeline is obtaining an appraisal waiver, which allows lenders to use an automated valuation model instead of a lengthy in-person appraisal. However, a federally mandated three-day rescission period after approval makes closing within the same week nearly impossible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in the Texas Hill Country that killed over 130 people, numerous organizations are collecting donations to support recovery efforts. The fast-moving waters of the Guadalupe River washed away homes and vehicles, devastating communities like Kerrville and a girls' summer camp. Relief funds have been established by local community foundations to direct aid to vetted nonprofits and first responders. National organizations like the American Red Cross and Salvation Army, along with local groups and businesses, are also providing meals, supplies, and financial assistance to affected families.</p>

          <p>Officials in the German state of Brandenburg are pushing for the return of a Yazidi family deported to Iraq, an action that may have violated a court order. The family, including four children, was removed on a charter flight despite a court lifting their obligation to leave the country on the same day. The deportation of Yazidis is highly controversial, as Germany's parliament has officially recognized the IS group's atrocities against the minority as genocide. Advocacy groups expressed concern that the family is not an isolated case, as many Yazidis fear being forcibly returned to a region still recovering from conflict.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses how to handle a friend who frequently makes disparaging comments about their own body, causing anxiety for the listener. Experts suggest first assessing the friendship's value and considering distancing oneself if the negativity is harmful. Alternatively, one could try to guide the conversation toward positivity by suggesting affirmations or asking how to provide genuine support beyond simple reassurance. The key is to set a boundary, explaining that the negative self-talk is distressing, and shift the focus to constructive actions or, if necessary, create space to protect one's own mental well-being.</p>

          <p>A recent study has classified five U.S. metropolitan areas as "impossibly unaffordable," placing them in the top 10 least affordable housing markets globally. The California cities of San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, along with Honolulu, Hawaii, were highlighted for their severe imbalance between median home prices and median incomes. The report, which analyzed 95 international markets, found Hong Kong to be the least affordable. The study attributes these high prices to policies that restrict urban growth, making it increasingly difficult for middle and working-class families to achieve homeownership.

          <p>A CDC report has detailed an incident where dozens of people in Stoughton, Wisconsin, were accidentally sickened by THC after eating from a local pizzeria. The restaurant, Famous Yeti's Pizza, unknowingly used THC-infused cooking oil borrowed from a licensed cannabis vendor that shared its kitchen space. The contaminated oil was used in dough for pizzas and other items, leading to 85 reported cases of THC intoxication with symptoms like dizziness and anxiety. No charges were filed as the investigation determined the contamination was unintentional, and the restaurant has since reopened.</p>

          <p>Republicans in states like Texas are pursuing mid-decade congressional redistricting to gain an advantage in the 2026 midterms, a move that challenges political norms. This has forced Democrats to consider retaliatory measures, but they face significant hurdles. Many Democratic-controlled states have independent commissions or constitutional prohibitions that prevent legislatures from easily redrawing maps, a result of their own past advocacy for fair districting. While governors in New York and California have expressed a willingness to fight back, they lack a clear path, leaving Democrats with few viable options to counter the GOP's power play.</p>

One patient with kidney cancer described the delay of his operation as a potential "death sentence," while the father of a three-year-old needing urgent lung surgery expressed frustration over an indefinite postponement. The strike, resulting from a pay dispute with the government, has forced hospitals to reschedule non-urgent procedures.

The call gains urgency following France's commitment to recognize Palestine.

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file employees. The legislation would offer a 3% corporate tax rate reduction to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of their workforce. Proponents argue the bill would expand ownership to millions of middle-class Americans, helping to address wealth inequality and foster employee loyalty. The plan is designed so the tax benefits would offset the costs of share dilution for participating companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The new "Failure to Travel" policy aims to establish clear consequences for non-compliance.
