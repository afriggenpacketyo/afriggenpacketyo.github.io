          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that President Biden's recent pardons, including one for his son Hunter, should be considered null and void due to concerns about his cognitive decline. The author cites audio from Special Counsel Robert Hur's investigation, suggesting Biden's unfitness for office. The article questions whether Biden fully understood the implications of his actions, particularly in light of his earlier statements against pardoning Hunter. The author calls for further investigation into Hunter Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci, urging the courts to determine Biden's competency at the time of signing the pardons.</p>

The blast resulted in one death and four injuries, with the FBI identifying a person-of-interest.

The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, confirmed the facility's IVF lab remained intact, and no staff members were harmed.

Despite this positive result, the article notes that the U.S. government still faces a significant deficit for the fiscal year. The article then transitions to offering personal finance advice on how individuals can create their own budget surplus by cutting wasteful spending and creating passive income streams.

The article suggests that this discovery is a grand coincidence of history, but also a powerful reminder that humanity has been fighting blind autocracy for centuries.</p>

          <p>This article in The Atlantic explores the evolving role of college chaplains, highlighting how they are adapting to meet the needs of a less religious student body. While religious affiliation among young adults is declining, college students are attending religious-life programs in larger numbers than in decades, with many chaplains taking inspiration from figures like William Sloane Coffin Jr. Modern chaplains are taking on a broader range of duties, including helping students navigate housing insecurity, safety threats, and campus protests, while also embracing alternative forms of spirituality and self-care.</p>
