          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were set to begin, pushing the deadline to August 1. This decision comes after the U.S. administration threatened new 30% tariffs on EU products, citing a non-reciprocal trade relationship. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the delay provides a window for negotiations to find a solution. If a deal is not reached, the EU will proceed with its prepared countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Rand Paul discussed his committee's report on the assassination attempt against then-candidate Trump, labeling the security failures a "cascade of errors." He accused former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle of not telling the truth to Congress about denied asset requests, including for counter-snipers. Paul asserted there was a "cultural cover-up" within the agency to avoid blame and that no one was fired for the significant security lapses. He also touched upon proposed federal budget cuts, including funding for public broadcasting.</p>

This move is seen by some as laying the groundwork to remove Powell, a frequent target of the administration's critiques. Future actions would depend on the Fed's answers to questions about the project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's pledge to deport "the worst of the worst," an analysis of government data reveals a different reality.

Critics and policy experts argue there is a significant disconnect between the administration's rhetoric and its actual enforcement actions. The data indicates a recent surge in arrests of non-criminals, challenging the claim that enforcement is primarily focused on dangerous individuals.</p>

          <p>Around the world, numerous abandoned locations have transformed from eerie, forgotten spaces into fascinating tourist attractions that offer a unique glimpse into the past. This article highlights sixteen such places, including the Maunsell Sea Forts in England, the sand-filled ghost town of Kolmanskop in Namibia, and a submerged church tower in Italy's Lake Reschen. These sites, once serving as prisons, hospitals, or industrial hubs, now draw visitors with their haunting beauty and rich history, proving that decay can give way to new life as a travel destination.</p>

          <h2>Recycling E-Waste for Rare Earths Emerges as a Key Strategy in US-China Tech Rivalry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:55:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid the geopolitical rivalry with China, which dominates the rare earth metals supply chain, the U.S. is increasingly looking towards recycling electronic waste as a viable alternative source. Next-generation recyclers are developing innovative methods to extract critical materials like neodymium from discarded computers and smartphones. This "urban mining" strategy could reduce dependence on foreign supply chains, mitigate the impact of trade disputes, and create a more localized source for materials essential for defense, consumer electronics, and green technologies.

          <p>Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, provides an analysis of how Beijing is likely to perceive and respond to Taiwan's recent large-scale military exercises. The discussion explores the strategic calculations and potential escalatory risks from mainland China's perspective. Sun's insights focus on the political and military signals being sent by both sides. The analysis suggests that while Beijing will certainly react, the nature of its response will be carefully calibrated based on its broader geopolitical objectives and its assessment of Taiwan's intentions.</p>

          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a patent attorney and amateur genealogist, inadvertently revolutionized crime-fighting by using her skills to identify the notorious Golden State Killer. By building a family tree using DNA from a crime scene uploaded to public databases, she provided the investigative lead that unmasked Joseph James DeAngelo. This technique, now known as investigative genetic genealogy, began when she helped an adult adoptee discover her true identity. Her work has since helped solve dozens of cold cases, though it also raises questions about genetic privacy.</p>

His firm stance contrasts with calls for a more pragmatic, negotiated approach from other European leaders in Germany and Italy.

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate successfully escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's bag. The cellmate was being released after completing his sentence, and the escapee concealed himself within the luggage to get past security. A prison administration official described the event as the result of an "accumulation of errors" and a "series of serious malfunctions." The escape from the overcrowded facility is considered an extremely rare and embarrassing security breach for the French prison service.</p>

While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she pointed to an upcoming announcement and a new £25 million package for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" to aid home charging. The move is intended to boost EV adoption, as high upfront costs and charging concerns remain significant barriers for many motorists ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.</p>
