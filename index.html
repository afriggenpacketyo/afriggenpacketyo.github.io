          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring countries like China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The shrine honors wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, causing diplomatic friction.  Ichiro Aisawa emphasized the importance of remembering the fallen heroes who contributed to Japan's peaceful post-war prosperity.  Former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi, labeled a right-wing nationalist, also visited the shrine. The visit occurs amidst ongoing sensitivity surrounding Japan's wartime history and its relations with Asian neighbors.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness, especially with renewed U.S. tariffs.  Some central banks may consider currency devaluation, but this carries risks such as capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S.  The European Central Bank recently cut rates, while others are hesitant to devalue their currencies to avoid instability.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on trade between China and the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to increased tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The current 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is putting pressure on profit margins and causing delays at borders.  The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further exacerbates the situation. Many dropshippers are shifting their focus to the European market to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
