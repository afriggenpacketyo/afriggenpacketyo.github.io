        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's Australian electric vehicle sales rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly a year, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. Sales of the Model Y soared by 122.5% year-over-year, offsetting a decline in Model 3 sales. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year. Globally, Tesla faces challenges from increased competition and reputational issues related to CEO Elon Musk's activities, although there have been some bright spots in Norway and Turkey.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump expressed his difficulty in making a deal with China's President Xi Jinping, amidst White House suggestions of potential talks between the two leaders.

China has criticized the U.S. for restricting its access to advanced technology and moving forward with visa revocations for Chinese students. Despite these tensions, both countries appear to be preparing for a potential phone call between Trump and Xi, with efforts being made to build trust and ensure a productive conversation.

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, intensifying trade war concerns and casting a shadow over an OECD ministerial meeting. This action has strained relationships with trading partners, including the EU and Canada, who have expressed strong opposition and are considering retaliation. Despite the tariff increase, imports from the U.K. will remain at 25% as both sides work on duties and quotas within their recently announced trade pact. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the tariffs, predicting the U.S. economy will face the biggest repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Max Muncy's performance in the Dodgers' 6-5 win against the Mets showcased his enigmatic season, with both positive and negative contributions. Muncy hit two home runs, including a game-tying solo shot in the ninth inning, but also committed a costly error at third base. His offensive surge, with a .314 batting average and eight home runs in his last 22 games, has helped offset his defensive struggles. Freddie Freeman ultimately secured the win with a walk-off double in the tenth inning, aided by an error from the Mets' outfielder.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. The move increases import taxes on the metals, which are used in everything from cars to canned food, for the second time since March. Trump has said the measures are intended to secure the future of the American steel industry. However, critics say the protections could wreak havoc on steel producers outside the US, spark retaliation from trade partners, and come at a punishing cost for American users of the metals.

          <p>A manhunt is in progress for Travis Decker, a former soldier, suspected of kidnapping and murdering his three daughters in Washington state. Officers have described Decker as having "extensive" military training and potentially posing a "significant risk", although it is not confirmed whether he is armed. The search involves police, the FBI, and US marshals, with drones and aircraft deployed to search remote areas. The alarm was raised when the girls' mother reported them missing after Decker failed to return them following a visit.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Seal Sanctuary Prioritizes Conservation Over Attachment</h2>

          <p>Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center, rescues and rehabilitates injured seals with a focus on returning them to the wild. To minimize heartbreak and prevent dependence, staff avoid naming or having direct contact with the seals. The center rescues seals found along the Sea of Okhotsk coast, primarily pups weakened by lack of food, and aims to release them within a year. While staff develop affection for the seals, they prioritize the animals' survival skills and integration back into their natural environment.</p>
