          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill critical positions after paying over 15,000 employees to resign through a deferred resignation program. This program, initiated by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce, has raised questions about the department's planning and efficiency. Rollins acknowledged potential mistakes but maintained that key positions were not accepted in the second round of the program, a claim disputed by some employees. The USDA has not yet responded to inquiries regarding discrepancies between Rollins' testimony and employee accounts, leaving the situation shrouded in uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A coalition of blue states, led by California, Colorado, and Washington, is suing the Trump administration for halting the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The lawsuit challenges the FHWA's actions, arguing that they undermine states' efforts to build EV charging infrastructure, combat climate change, and support green economies. The states argue Trump's directives are unlawful and seek to reinstate the funding. The lawsuit comes amidst rising vandalism against Tesla vehicles and charging stations, linked to protests against Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

          <p>A federal judge questioned the Trump administration's actions regarding Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador, expressing skepticism about the reasons for avoiding their return to the U.S. Lawyers for the migrants argued that the administration should be responsible for facilitating their return, as they were deported to a terrorism prison in El Salvador under an apparent agreement with the Salvadoran government. The judge pressed the Justice Department lawyer about President Trump's authority to influence the Salvadoran government, highlighting conflicting statements made by officials. The judge deferred ruling on the request to return the migrants, instead ordering the government to disclose more information about its arrangements with El Salvador.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led state legislatures banning 'unofficial flags' on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds by changing their official flags. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed and the city council approved three new city flags, each featuring the city's traditional sego lily design imposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag after the state legislature passed a similar ban. These actions are a direct response to what local leaders see as an attack on LGBTQ+ rights by the Trump administration and conservative legislatures.</p>

Truman was lost in the Red Sea; in this latest incident, the jet went overboard during a failed landing attempt. The pilots ejected safely and sustained minor injuries. The previous incident involved a Super Hornet falling overboard while being towed in the hangar bay, and initial reports suggested it may have been related to evasive action against Houthi militants, though the Pentagon has stated this was not the case. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several other serious incidents since its deployment, including an accidental shoot-down and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

India conducted nationwide preparedness exercises, including simulations for potential blackouts and mass evacuations, as Pakistan considered its response. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, advising citizens to shelter in place or depart areas of active conflict, and President Trump commented that he wants to see the two nations 'work it out'.</p>

The complaint describes UnitedHealthcare's strategy as aggressive and anti-consumer, especially after Thompson's death triggered public outrage over health insurance costs. Following a lower performance forecast, UnitedHealth's stock price plummeted, leading investors to seek damages from the company and its executives.</p>

          <p>Coal miners in West Virginia are losing access to free black lung screenings due to budget cuts mandated by President Trump at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These cuts have resulted in job losses and concerns about rising rates of black lung among younger miners. The Trump administration plans to terminate all staff in the coming months, jeopardizing health screenings and other programs. Critics argue that these cuts are detrimental to worker safety and will lead to increased injuries and illnesses, despite the administration's focus on supporting the coal industry.</p>

          <p>A dog attack in New York City, where a Chihuahua named Penny was mauled by two pit bulls, has sparked national outrage and inspired proposed legislation called 'Penny's Law'. The law seeks to criminalize negligent dog handling and penalize owners who flee the scene of an attack, as current New York law considers dogs as property, making such incidents civil matters. Ken Philipps, a dog bite attorney, weighed in on the attack, emphasizing the need for stricter accountability for dog owners to prevent future incidents and protect public safety.</p>

          <p>As the economic impact of President Trump's trade wars remains elusive in traditional economic data, economists are turning to alternative measures and anecdotes to gauge the effects. Declining spending at McDonald's, fewer container ships at the Port of Los Angeles, and production shifts by Mattel are among the signs economists are monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also closely watching these indicators as it navigates monetary policy amid trade uncertainty. Economists are divided on how tariffs will manifest, with some expecting higher prices and reduced consumer spending, while others anticipate layoffs in manufacturing and shipping.</p>
