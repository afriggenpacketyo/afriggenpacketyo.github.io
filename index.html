          <p>Republican Senator Susan Collins has expressed significant apprehension regarding President Donald Trump's intention to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar's royal family for conversion into Air Force One. Collins stated that the transaction raises concerns of political espionage, ethical, and constitutional problems. She highlighted the necessity of thoroughly inspecting the plane for listening devices, which would require substantial time and resources to ensure presidential security standards are met. While acknowledging Trump's frustration with Boeing's delays in producing a new presidential aircraft, Collins believes accepting a gift jet is not a viable solution.</p>

          <p>Representative Summer Lee, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is spearheading a renewed legislative effort to provide reparations to Black Americans, reviving a cause previously championed by former Representative Cori Bush. Lee's resolution aims to address historical injustices by allocating federal resources to descendants of enslaved people brought to the United States. Joined by fellow progressive Democrats, Lee asserts the moral imperative to rectify the enduring economic disparities resulting from slavery and systemic discrimination. While acknowledging the challenges in passing such legislation, particularly with Republican control of Congress and the White House, Lee remains steadfast in advocating for reparations as a means to level the playing field and address historical harms.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani met in Turkey to discuss lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria after President Trump announced he would end sanctions and met with the country’s president, a former jihadist. Rubio emphasized the U.S. goal of establishing a peaceful, stable Syria and expressed encouragement from Syria’s new government. The Trump administration plans to issue a temporary waiver of some sanctions, allowing American dollars to flow into the country and enabling Syria’s neighbors to fund reconstruction. The United States first imposed sanctions on Syria in the 1970s, introducing more punishing restrictions on the Assad regime during Syria’s civil war.</p>

Johnson aims to find a consensus and pass the bill by Memorial Day, claiming Republicans are aiming to pass the package in a "deficit-neutral way."

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on President Donald Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship, which would limit U.S. citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The case also addresses the legality of individual district court judges blocking presidential policy nationwide. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the citizenship clause related to children of former slaves, not to illegal aliens. Justices questioned whether eliminating nationwide injunctions could allow unlawful executive orders to remain in place too long before the Supreme Court can weigh in.</p>

A major sticking point is whether Iran would be able to enrich uranium at a lower grade for civilian use or would have to dismantle its program completely.

          <p>Coinbase confirmed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the crypto exchange has misstated its user numbers. The inquiry focuses on the number of "verified users" reported by the company, which it has claimed is more than 100 million in various securities filings and marketing materials. Coinbase's chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the investigation is a hold-over from the prior administration about a metric the company stopped reporting two and a half years ago. The company is working with the SEC to resolve the matter.</p>

          <p>President Trump's long-standing focus on citizenship and who qualifies as American has fueled his political career, with the Supreme Court reviewing his effort to overturn birthright citizenship. Trump has questioned President Obama's birthplace, asserted Senator Ted Cruz's ineligibility due to his birth in Canada, and falsely claimed Nikki Haley was disqualified from running for president because her parents were not yet citizens when she was born. His actions reflect a pattern of dividing people and questioning who belongs in America. The issue before the court is primarily about whether federal judges have the power to order block presidential actions through wide-ranging temporary pauses, known as nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to cut green tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, which could lower some Americans’ household income by more than $1,000 a year due to increased utility bills and job losses.

At least 19 states would see the cost of energy increase for both consumers and industry between 2026 to 2032.

The Trump administration has been in direct talks with three of Israel’s main adversaries — Hamas, Iran, and the Houthis — to cut deals without Israel’s input, a nearly unprecedented situation according to longtime observers of relations between the two countries. This shift may be due to Trump's frustration with Netanyahu, the rise of the so-called restrainer wing of Republican foreign policy, and the changing dynamics in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers that the Federal Aviation Administration has resorted to buying replacement parts on eBay and making new parts with 3D printers for its aging systems. The Trump administration is pushing for a sweeping overhaul of the country's air traffic control system over the next three years, calling for the replacement of hundreds of radars, over a dozen new control towers and a new telecommunications system. The FAA has not cut any air traffic controllers, and the layoffs and voluntary buyouts that hit the federal workforce earlier this year excluded safety positions.</p>

Powell said that "supply shocks" are a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.</p>
