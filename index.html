        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Online Safety Act has prompted major websites like PornHub and Reddit to implement age verification systems. In response, Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps have surged to the top of Apple's App Store charts as users seek to circumvent these new restrictions by masking their location. One VPN provider reported an 1,800% increase in sign-ups, highlighting public privacy concerns over the data collection required for age checks. However, cybersecurity experts warn that many free VPN services carry significant privacy and security risks of their own.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Senators Urge U.S. to Cease Funding for Israeli-Backed Aid Group in Gaza</h2>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to halt its $30 million in funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio expresses grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of Palestinian deaths at chaotic aid distribution sites. The senators advocate for resuming support for established UN aid mechanisms, citing a severe and worsening humanitarian crisis where starvation is a growing threat. This move comes amid international criticism of the GHF and reports of its ineffectiveness and danger.</p>

          <h2>Israel Increases Aid Flow to Gaza, But UN Warns It's Insufficient to Avert Starvation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:21:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following international condemnation over images of starving children, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including truck convoys and airdrops. On Sunday, 120 trucks entered the territory, a significant increase but still a fraction of the 500-plus trucks per day needed to address the crisis, according to the UN. The UN's agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, warns that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and the death toll from hunger exceeds 100. Despite Israel announcing daily humanitarian pauses, desperation is leading to "self-distribution" where people loot aid convoys before they reach depots.</p>

          <p>Over 185 million people across the United States, from the Midwest to the East Coast, are under alerts for a dangerous and prolonged heatwave. The Southeast is expected to bear the brunt, with heat indices—the "feels-like" temperature—forecast to reach between 105 and 120 degrees in some areas. Major cities like Atlanta and Charlotte face an extreme heat risk, with little relief expected overnight as temperatures remain high. The sweltering conditions are exacerbated in the Northeast by smoke from Canadian wildfires, which continues to cause hazy skies and poor air quality.</p>

          <p>When asked if he believed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims that there is no starvation in Gaza, President Trump responded, "I don't know." Speaking alongside UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump referenced television images of hungry children, stating they "look very hungry." His comments represent a notable public questioning of a key ally's narrative on the humanitarian situation. The statement came as the Hamas-run health ministry reported more deaths from malnutrition and killings near aid distribution sites, further highlighting the dire conditions in the territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Africa's Sahel region has transformed into a major hub for smuggling people and drugs, exacerbated by recent military coups and shifting political alliances. After new military governments in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso aligned with Russia and distanced themselves from Europe, anti-smuggling laws were repealed, causing the illicit trade to flourish. Drug seizures, particularly cocaine, have skyrocketed by over 11,000% since 2020, with criminal networks gaining significant financial power and corrupting local officials. Experts warn this dynamic is fueling a rise in "narco-terrorism," as jihadist groups become more directly involved in the lucrative drug trade.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline of October 1 approaching, divisions are emerging within the Republican party over how to proceed. Some conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus have suggested they could support a full-year continuing resolution (CR), which would freeze spending at current levels. However, this idea is being met with strong opposition from mainstream Republicans and defense hawks, who argue a full-year CR would harm military funding and is a legislative surrender. This intra-party conflict creates significant uncertainty as Congress has only 14 legislative days to pass a budget and avert a government shutdown.</p>

These genes can be transferred to bacteria like E. coli, which can then infect humans, making common infections difficult or impossible to treat. The study developed a risk-assessment framework to map global hotspots for these high-risk ARGs, aiming to guide policy and research to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

This shift, combined with projects like a Trump Tower being built on a symbolically significant site in Serbia, signals to authoritarian leaders worldwide that they no longer face pressure from Washington over human rights abuses. The author contends this emboldens despots and accelerates a global trend toward authoritarianism, leaving pro-democracy activists more vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal, narrowly avoiding a deadline that would have imposed steep U.S. tariffs on EU goods. The agreement, announced by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, establishes a 15% tariff on most EU exports. In return, the EU has committed to investing an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and purchasing $750 billion worth of American energy. Leaders on both sides praised the deal for bringing stability and predictability to the $2 trillion transatlantic trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Investor Mark Cuban shared the story of one of his first entrepreneurial ventures: selling powdered milk at age 24 with less than $20 in capital. The business failed within a month because, as he discovered, nobody wanted his product. This early experience taught him a crucial lesson: "it doesn't matter how many times you fail, you only have to be right one time." For aspiring entrepreneurs with no money, Cuban advises focusing on "sweat equity" by turning a personal skill into a service, such as tutoring, design, or consulting on new technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>As U.S. and Chinese officials began a third round of trade talks in Sweden, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that he does not expect an "enormous breakthrough." Greer described China's willingness to engage as a "good sign" but emphasized the talks are more about monitoring existing agreements than forging new ones. A key issue is whether a temporary pause on tariffs, set to expire August 12, will be extended. The comments suggest a cautious approach from Washington, even as the administration has recently secured trade deals with other major partners like the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For Americans looking to buy a home or refinance, understanding current interest rates is crucial in a challenging market. As of late July 2025, national average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage are approximately 6.79%, while a 15-year mortgage averages around 6.01%. Experts suggest that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. To get the best possible rate, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit score, pay bills on time, and shop around to compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for becoming more influential and likable at work. This involves more than just hearing someone; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This "superhero move" shows you are competent and empathetic, which builds trust and makes you more likable to colleagues and managers. Research co-authored by Brooks shows that simply asking follow-up questions correlates with higher likability, which in turn can lead to more positive performance reviews and career success.</p>

The piece argues that the lack of accessible homes is a systemic issue, forcing many into humiliating or unsafe living situations and preventing full participation in family and community life.
