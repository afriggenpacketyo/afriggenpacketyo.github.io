            <h2>US Lawmakers Express Concerns Over Trump's Tariffs and Impact on Alliances</h2>

            <p>Democratic lawmakers voiced apprehension at congressional hearings regarding President Trump's global tariffs, fearing they would strain alliances, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Concerns were raised about tariffs on key allies like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, questioning how these measures strengthen alliances against China. Some lawmakers noted that Trump's tariff threats had inadvertently pushed Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul into trilateral meetings to mitigate the economic pressure, highlighting the unintended strategic consequences of the administration's trade policies. The hearings underscored a growing skepticism over the broader strategic implications of Trump's trade policies on international relations.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a pause on tariffs for 90 days for most countries, claiming it was due to nations offering to negotiate trade deals, while simultaneously escalating tariffs on China. The move creates economic uncertainty, as the baseline 10% global tariff and the trade war with China are expected to raise import prices and impact jobs dependent on international trade. Experts suggest that the tariffs were both a massive change in economic policy and a bluff to get other countries to negotiate, and that it will be important to monitor whether nations follow through with negotiations.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on newly imposed tariffs for most countries, except China, citing willingness from nations to negotiate new trade deals. The decision followed days of market instability, which Trump attributed to people getting "a little bit afraid." While pausing tariffs for allies, Trump escalated the trade war with China by raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% in response to Beijing's retaliatory measures. White House officials portrayed the reversal as a strategic move to create leverage for negotiations, while critics accused Trump of reacting to market pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's newest tariffs could have significant implications for consumer spending, particularly affecting low-income families who spend a larger proportion of their income on essential goods. Economists warn that the tariffs could exacerbate inequalities by increasing the cost of everyday items and potentially leading to job losses. The tariffs impact a wide range of consumer goods, from food and electronics to clothing and automobiles, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced purchasing power. Experts suggest consumers should prepare by stocking up on necessities, seeking substitutes, and carefully evaluating their budgets.</p>

            <p>President Trump signed an executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, the law firm that helped Dominion Voting Systems secure a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News. The order seeks to limit the firm's access to government buildings, revoke security clearances, and prevent it from representing anyone with business before the federal government. Trump's rationale for targeting the firm was not immediately clear, but it marks the latest effort to punish attorneys and firms who have opposed his interests.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled on the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, allowing President Trump to continue deportations but requiring due process for detainees to challenge their removal. The Court held that detainees subject to removal orders are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. However, the ruling also narrowed the path by which those detainees can contest their removal, requiring them to seek review through a writ of habeas corpus.</p>

The Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on all imported canned beer and empty aluminum cans. While Trump announced that so-called reciprocal tariffs on countries excluding China would fall to 10% for the next 90 days, the temporary abatement does not apply to sector-specific duties, like those on aluminum.
