        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article refutes the claim that the current generation of Americans is the "sickest in history," a central tenet of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement. It presents extensive historical data showing dramatic improvements in public health, including a near doubling of life expectancy since the late 19th century due to vaccines, antibiotics, and better sanitation. While acknowledging modern health challenges like obesity and mental illness, the piece argues that progress against infectious diseases, cancer, and environmental pollutants has made Americans far healthier than their ancestors. The author warns against revolutionary health policy changes that could undermine decades of foundational public health achievements.</p>

          <p>British television presenter Davina McCall is engaged to her partner of seven years, celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas. The news was confirmed by her representative following initial reports. This personal milestone comes shortly after McCall, 57, shared positive news about her health, revealing that a benign brain tumor she had surgically removed last year is not returning. Douglas has been a supportive figure throughout her recovery from the craniotomy. McCall, a prominent host known for shows like "Big Brother," has been married twice before and has three children.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that officials in Downing Street and the Foreign Office knew about supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended the ambassador. Sources indicate that while the offices were alerted to a media inquiry about the messages, the Prime Minister himself was not aware of their specific contents when he initially stood by Lord Mandelson. Following the public release of the emails, which revealed a close relationship, Mandelson was dismissed from his post as the UK's ambassador to the US. The situation has prompted criticism regarding the flow of information to the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is pressuring Performance Food Group (PFG) to explore a merger with its competitor, US Foods. Sachem Head, which has nominated four new candidates to PFG's board, argues that such a combination could unlock significant synergies, potentially between $800 million and $1 billion, by rationalizing purchasing, logistics, and warehouse operations. The firm points to the precedent of the attempted Sysco/US Foods merger to illustrate the potential value creation. While acknowledging potential antitrust hurdles, Sachem Head believes the current regulatory environment is more favorable and urges the board to evaluate the opportunity for the benefit of shareholders.

          <p>China's government has announced the launch of an anti-dumping investigation into analog integrated circuit chips imported from the United States. Concurrently, Beijing has also initiated an anti-discrimination probe concerning Washington's policies and handling of Chinese semiconductor products. This move escalates the ongoing technological and trade tensions between the two global economic powers.

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its purchase of over 5 million shares in the second quarter. However, it remains unclear if Warren Buffett's firm has seen a paper profit from the investment. Depending on the exact purchase price within the quarter's trading range, Berkshire's position could be anywhere from a significant loss to a substantial gain. Analysts have become more positive on UNH's outlook following management discussions, with some raising their price targets, but the stock is still down significantly for the year, reflecting its earlier troubles.

          <p>An airstrike, reportedly carried out by Myanmar's military junta, has killed at least 19 students and injured many more at two private schools in Rakhine state. The attack occurred in a village within a township controlled by the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic armed group engaged in an offensive against the ruling junta. Local media reports suggest a warplane dropped two large bombs on a school while students were sleeping. The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, has condemned the "brutal attack," which is part of a pattern of escalating violence against civilians since the military coup in 2021.</p>

          <p>New documents reviewed by Reuters indicate that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook declared an Atlanta property as a “vacation home” on a 2021 loan estimate. This evidence appears to counter accusations from the Trump administration that she committed mortgage fraud by claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences. Critics, led by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, had used other mortgage paperwork to prompt a Department of Justice investigation. However, the loan estimate and a separate security clearance form where she listed the property as a "second home" support Cook's denial of any wrongdoing, according to independent real estate experts.</p>

According to market research firm Circana, morning meal traffic to these convenience stores climbed 9% in a recent three-month period, while fast-food traffic rose only 1%. This trend is driven by convenience stores expanding their foodservice options, offering greater variety and perceived value, which appeals to budget-conscious consumers. Even fast-food giants like McDonald's have acknowledged that breakfast is their weakest and most economically sensitive daypart, as consumers find it easier to eat at home or find cheaper alternatives.</p>

Simultaneously, a narrative is emerging that frames Kirk as a martyr and a civil rights leader, with some comparing him to figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln.

          <p>Researchers have discovered a bizarre reproductive strategy in Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus), where queens produce offspring of a completely different species to create their workforce. The queens, having lost the ability to produce their own workers, mate with males of another species, Messor structor, to create hybrid worker ants. More remarkably, to ensure a supply of these males without needing to find them in the wild, the queens can clone the Messor structor males using only their stored sperm. This unique phenomenon, termed "sexual domestication," represents a newly identified mode of reproduction and is changing how scientists understand evolution and genetics in social insects.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of heading toward stagflation, a rare combination of stagnant growth and high inflation, a phenomenon last seen in the 1970s. Recent data reveals that job growth has slowed significantly while the inflation rate has started to rise again, hitting 2.9% in August. Several economists are attributing this trend to Trump administration policies, particularly tariffs that increase consumer prices and an immigration crackdown that tightens the labor supply. This economic scenario complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy, as its primary tools are less effective when unemployment and inflation rise simultaneously.</p>

          <p>A group of scientists is urging U.S. public health officials to treat Chagas disease as endemic to the country, not just as an illness imported from Latin America. The disease is caused by a parasite spread through the feces of "kissing bugs," which are found within the United States, and infections have been documented in at least eight states. The report, published in a CDC journal, argues that low awareness among physicians and the public leads to underdiagnosis. If left untreated, the initially mild or asymptomatic disease can cause severe, chronic heart and digestive problems later in life, making early detection and treatment crucial.</p>

          <p>According to travel experts at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for finding affordable airfare is to be flexible with travel dates. Data analysis shows that flying mid-week—on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—is typically 13% cheaper than flying on the weekend. Shifting travel plans by even a day or two can result in significant savings. The experts also debunked the myth that the day of the week you book your ticket matters, stating that the day you actually fly is far more important. For further savings, travelers are advised to consider trips during a destination's off-season or shoulder season.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's significant financial commitments are driving a major boom across the tech sector, with Oracle being the latest beneficiary. Oracle's stock experienced a historic surge after revealing massive contracts for cloud computing infrastructure, a substantial portion of which is tied to OpenAI's future needs. This follows similar gains for companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom, all of which are key suppliers for the AI giant's resource-intensive operations. While this spending has added trillions to the market caps of these established companies, some analysts express concern about the concentration of risk in a single, cash-burning startup like OpenAI.

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County are issuing a warning about a synthetic kratom compound known as 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) after it was linked to three fatal overdoses in young adults. The compound, which can have opioid-like effects at high doses, is found in products sold at gas stations and smoke shops as tablets, gummies, and shots. The L.A. County Department of Public Health noted that alcohol was also a factor in all three deaths and urged residents to avoid the substance, especially in combination with other drugs. The FDA has also warned that 7-OH is not approved for any use and is illegal to add to dietary supplements.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group (CWG), a panel of five hand-picked climate science skeptics. The group produced a report, widely criticized by independent scientists as erroneous and misleading, which was used to support the Trump administration's efforts to roll back climate pollution regulations. The decision to dissolve the group comes amid a lawsuit filed by environmental organizations alleging the CWG was created in secret and violated federal law. In his letter to the members, Wright claimed the group's purpose was to "catalyze scientific and public debate" and that this goal had been achieved.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. has become more complicated this year, as the FDA has narrowed its approval to specific high-risk groups, such as those 65 and older or with certain underlying health conditions. This is a shift from previous years when the shots were available to nearly everyone. Many younger, healthy individuals may now be turned away at pharmacies unless they can "self-attest" to having a risk factor from a broad list provided by the CDC, which includes conditions like asthma, obesity, and depression. The change has created confusion regarding eligibility, insurance coverage, and access, particularly for children and pregnant individuals.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 16th to 18th. He and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The itinerary includes a formal welcome with a royal salute, a wreath-laying at the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, and a state banquet. President Trump will also meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. The visit is considered unusual, as second-term U.S. presidents are not typically offered a full state visit, and protest groups have already announced plans for demonstrations in London.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. Initially promoted by the socialist state as a modern solution to housing shortages and a symbol of utopian community living, these buildings became associated with post-reunification decline and social problems. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," uses art to delve into the collective memory and social history of these structures. It examines them not just as architectural heritage but as sites of both idealized community and painful social transformation.</p>

The collection, co-edited by Deborah Davis and Terry Lautz, features figures from science, diplomacy, and the arts who fostered crucial exchanges between the two nations after 1979. The editors argue that in the current climate of intense competition, both countries have lost sight of the shared interests and mutual benefits that once defined their relationship. The book serves as a reminder of the positive potential of cooperation, even amidst deep political differences.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica, California, is facing a severe financial crisis, prompting the City Council to declare a state of "fiscal distress." While a post-pandemic economic downturn and declining tourism revenue are contributing factors, the city's finances have been crippled by hundreds of millions of dollars in legal settlements. Santa Monica has already paid out $229 million related to claims of sexual abuse by a former police dispatcher, with 180 more claims still pending. The massive liability, combined with a projected budget deficit, has raised concerns about potential cuts to city services and possible layoffs for municipal employees.</p>
