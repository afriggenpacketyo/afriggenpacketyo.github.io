        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are proceeding with plans to cut hundreds of billions from Medicaid, despite internal disagreements over the extent of the cuts. The proposed legislation includes work requirements for recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants, aiming for $880 billion in savings over a decade. While Trump has pledged not to cut Medicaid, the bill faces opposition from both moderate and conservative Republicans, and Democrats criticize it as harmful to low-income Americans. The plan also addresses tax provisions, including an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a temporary increase in the child tax credit.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's shares experienced a significant drop after the company withdrew its full-year guidance and announced a $75 million write-off of spring and summer merchandise. The apparel retailer cited slower sales, increased discounting, and economic uncertainty as reasons for the disappointing first-quarter performance. CEO Jay Schottenstein expressed disappointment with the company's execution and announced active evaluation of forward plans to strengthen product performance. The company expects an operating loss for the quarter due to higher-than-planned discounting and the inventory write-down, which has led to uncertainty about recent tariff policy changes and their effects on the company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates a growing disparity between what Americans earn and the income needed for a basic standard of living, considering necessities like technology, education, and healthcare. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finds that a "minimal quality of life" is unattainable for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The report highlights that while traditional economic indicators suggest a thriving economy, they fail to reflect the lived reality for many Americans, as costs have surged while income growth lags. The gap between low-income families' earnings and the minimum cost of living is expected to widen due to inflating costs of essential goods and services.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adam Schiff is urging the Department of Defense's Inspector General to investigate the Trump administration's potential acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One. Concerns include the constitutionality, legality, and national security implications of the gift. Schiff and other Senate Democrats suggest the DOD may be used to facilitate an impermissible gift, requiring taxpayer-funded retrofitting and eventual transfer to Trump's library.

          <p>Deep within the American Museum of Natural History lies a locked room housing a colony of dermestid beetles, responsible for meticulously cleaning animal skeletons. These flesh-eating beetles consume the meat off specimens, leaving behind pristine bones too delicate for human hands to clean. The colony, descended from beetles brought from Africa in the 1930s, works around the clock in wooden boxes, creating a soft, crackling sound of gnawing. To ensure the beetles remain contained and well-fed, museum staff maintain a strict regimen of specimen provision and emergency food supplies, such as chicken or pigs' feet.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has announced a change in policy, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. This decision reverses the league's stance on permanent ineligibility, stating that bans expire upon death. Rose's ban was lifted posthumously, and Jackson's reinstatement opens the door for consideration despite his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider these players, although induction is not guaranteed, considering factors like integrity and character.</p>

          <p>The FAA reported that as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace on a Monday night, despite a target of 14, leading to flight delays and cancellations. The agency cited a national shortage of air traffic controllers and ongoing challenges with technology and runway construction at Newark. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that the measures are to guarantee safety. While the FAA said that the U.S. is facing a national shortage of air traffic controllers and staffing goals for Newark's airspace have not been met for years, experts say that the shortage alone would not likely pose a threat to passenger safety.</p>

The article delves into the tension between art as truth-telling and art as propaganda, suggesting that successful ideological art captures aspects of reality recognizable even to those with differing worldviews. Examples like V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Andor" Star Wars series are used to illustrate how art can convey conservative or leftist perspectives while still resonating with audiences across the political spectrum. The key is unsettlement rather than conversion, prompting viewers to consider truths outside their favored systems.</p>

The FDA plans to conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for the vaccine's use in older adults. The Ixchiq vaccine, containing a live, weakened version of the virus, may cause symptoms similar to chikungunya, including fever and severe joint pain.</p>
