          <p>Robin Kaye, a music supervisor for "American Idol," and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found shot to death in their fortified Los Angeles home. A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested for the murders, which police believe occurred during a burglary. Authorities suggest the suspect entered the home without force and encountered the couple when they returned, leading to a fatal struggle. The incident is being treated as a random act of violence rather than a targeted attack, and police state it appears to be an isolated event. A spokesperson for "American Idol" expressed devastation over the loss of Kaye, who had been with the show since 2009.</p>

          <p>A group of former Justice Department prosecutors is actively trying to block the federal judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for Donald Trump. In a memo to senators, they label Bove a political "hatchet man" and allege he would lack impartiality on the bench, citing accusations of politically motivated firings and a whistleblower complaint. The group is urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay its vote until it can hear from the whistleblower, who claims Bove sought to ignore court orders. Despite the opposition, the White House has strongly defended Bove's qualifications for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

          <p>Florida's Attorney General, James Uthmeier, has threatened to sue U.S. Masters Swimming if the organization does not alter its policy regarding transgender athletes. The policy allows members to compete in categories aligning with their gender identity but has specific eligibility requirements for its women's recognition programs. Uthmeier contends the policy is insufficient and violates Florida law, emphasizing the state's commitment to protecting women's and girls' sports. The controversy gained attention after a transgender swimmer won multiple gold medals in a women's category, prompting calls for review and investigations in other states like Texas.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reflected on the unpredictable nature of the current earnings season, highlighting both surprising successes and significant disappointments. He celebrated Nvidia's stock surge after the White House permitted the company to resume chip sales to China, a move he correctly anticipated. However, Cramer expressed frustration with the market's negative reaction to earnings from BlackRock and Wells Fargo. Investors focused on BlackRock's lower-than-expected net inflows and Wells Fargo's reduced guidance for net interest income, causing their stocks to fall despite some underlying strengths. He remains confident in their long-term prospects but acknowledged the immediate challenges of market perception during earnings season. (not investment advice)</p>

A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, following a review initiated by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. The case against Torres was built on unreliable witness testimony, and investigators were later criticized for ignoring evidence that pointed to another suspect and failing to disclose exculpatory information. The settlement resolves Torres's federal civil lawsuit against the county for the decades of wrongful incarceration he endured.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, about half the force deployed last month amid protests. The Pentagon stated the move was possible because "lawlessness is subsiding." The initial deployment, which occurred over Governor Gavin Newsom's objections, was intended to protect federal property and immigration agents. Newsom, who had sued the administration over the federalization of the troops, called for the remaining forces to be returned to state control, describing their continued presence as serving as "political pawns" without a clear mission.</p>

During his visit for a BBC documentary, he inspected the stump, where new green shoots are now growing, and reflected on the tree's significance as a place of solace.

          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed as "assistants" to prevent patients from confusing them with doctors. The review, prompted by debate over the roles' responsibilities, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from physicians. Authored by Professor Gillian Leng, the report notes that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to confusion and instances where PAs covered doctor shortages without adequate supervision.

The legislation proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a seven-year path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also includes provisions for increased border security, asylum system reforms, and protections for sensitive locations like schools and hospitals.

The ambitious plan involves moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad, and replacing all 16,000 panes of glass with better-insulated material.

Josh Hawley also demanding more information and suggesting Ghislaine Maxwell testify before Congress. The issue highlights a rare point of friction between GOP leadership and the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills, backed by President Donald Trump, failed to clear a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives. The unexpected 196-223 vote, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats in opposition, has stalled the legislation during what was promoted as "Crypto Week." The bills include the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, the CLARITY Act to define regulatory oversight, and a proposal to block a central bank digital currency. The failure marks a significant setback for the crypto industry and a rare instance of House Republicans defying a direct directive from Trump, who had urged a "yes" vote.</p>

          <p>British actor Owen Cooper, 15, has become one of the youngest-ever Emmy nominees for his role in the Netflix series "Adolescence." He received a nomination for best supporting actor in a limited series, and if he wins, he will be the youngest male actor to do so. The critically acclaimed show, about a boy accused of murder, secured a total of 13 nominations, including nods for lead actor Stephen Graham and for outstanding limited series. While "Adolescence" had a strong showing, the workplace satire "Severance" led all programs with 27 nominations, followed by "The Penguin" and "The White Lotus."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has struck down a Biden-era rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports. The ruling is a significant setback for advocates who argue that healthcare expenses are not a reliable indicator of creditworthiness and unfairly penalize those who get sick. The judge sided with a credit union league, agreeing that the CFPB had exceeded its authority. Consumer advocacy groups criticized the decision as a win for "corporate profiteers," while a credit industry association praised it for protecting the integrity of the financial system.</p>

          <p>Amid rising cross-strait tensions, academic and policy discussions within mainland China about how to govern Taiwan after a potential reunification have intensified. While Beijing has long proposed a "one country, two systems" model, detailed public discourse on the subject has grown significantly under President Xi Jinping. This article surveys the research by mainland academics, who are exploring various paths and models for governance. This intellectual groundwork is developing as Taiwan's government continues to assert its sovereignty and Washington maintains its support for the island, creating a complex and evolving geopolitical environment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has experienced a significant rise in officer-involved shootings, with 25 incidents recorded so far in 2025, nearly matching the total of 29 for all of 2024. This increase, which includes four shootings in a recent two-week span, is the highest mid-year total since 2018. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell attributed the uptick to more encounters with armed suspects, including those with replica firearms, which complicates threat assessment for officers. The trend is occurring even as overall violent crime in the city is decreasing, prompting concern from police oversight officials and community members.</p>

The announcement aligns with the Trump administration's goal, outlined in May executive orders, to significantly expand U.S. nuclear power capacity by 2050. This ambitious plan follows the completion of two AP1000 reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, a project that faced significant delays and cost overruns.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Trump administration, arguing its capacity to handle disasters is being systematically weakened. It points to a delayed and inadequate response to recent Texas floods and past political favoritism in allocating aid as evidence of dysfunction. The piece contends that despite rhetoric about rethinking FEMA, the administration is cutting climate research, canceling infrastructure grant programs, and gutting forecasting agencies like NOAA. The author concludes that these actions are creating a more vulnerable nation by destroying the federal government's ability to prepare for and recover from crises.</p>

          <p>In the trial of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, federal prosecutors have accused him of running a $1 billion crypto-laundering conspiracy. They described his platform as a "giant washing machine for dirty money" that was the preferred tool for criminals, including the North Korean-linked Lazarus Group, which used it to launder hundreds of millions from hacks. The prosecution alleges Storm knew his tool was used for illicit purposes and profited from it. The defense argues that Storm is a privacy advocate who created a legitimate tool and had no intention of aiding criminals, stating the vast majority of users were normal people seeking financial privacy.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the U.S. and its NATO allies are coordinating to send more advanced military aid to Ukraine, including 17 additional Patriot missile systems. The move signals growing frustration with Russia's unwillingness to negotiate an end to the war. Shipments of previously paused U.S. armaments, such as Patriot, AIM, and Hellfire missiles, are now reportedly flowing into Ukraine. This increased support comes as President Trump has threatened Russia with severe tariffs if it does not engage in peace talks, a change from his previous stance. The Kremlin called the U.S. statements "very serious" and said it needed time to analyze them.</p>

The commissioner concluded the breach was inadvertent but noted it could have been avoided with greater attention to the rules.
