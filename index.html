          <p>A court in the United Kingdom has convicted three men for carrying out an arson attack on businesses linked to Ukraine, which British officials say was ordered by the Russian Wagner Group. The attack, which occurred in March 2024, targeted a warehouse in London storing generators and Starlink equipment destined for Ukraine, causing approximately £1 million in damages. Prosecutors stated that one of the ringleaders, who had previously pleaded guilty, knowingly acted on behalf of the Wagner Group, which is designated as a terrorist organization in the UK.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant reversal of a 70-year-old policy, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This change effectively nullifies the Johnson Amendment, which has long prohibited such endorsements by non-profit organizations. The filing was part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by the National Religious Broadcasters and two Texas churches who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. This move aligns with a long-standing goal of former President Donald Trump to repeal the restriction.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about inflation have subsided, with short-term expectations returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The June Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that respondents anticipate an inflation rate of 3% over the next year, a notable decrease from the peak of 3.6% seen in March and April. Despite the improved overall outlook, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent, though employment metrics showed some positive signs.

          <p>A public inquiry has begun into the deadly Southport attack, with the chairman calling the murders of three young girls "one of the most egregious crimes in our country's history." The inquiry will investigate how public bodies handled the perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana, whose troubling behavior and history of violence were known to authorities prior to the attack at a dance studio. The first phase will analyze his dealings with various agencies to identify any missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy, which also left eight other children and two adults seriously injured.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a third known interstellar object, a comet named 3I/ATLAS, that has entered our solar system, but they assure it poses no danger to Earth. The comet, estimated to be about 20 kilometers wide, was spotted by a telescope in Chile and is currently 670 million kilometers from the sun. At its closest approach in October, it will still be more than 1.5 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. Scientists will continue to monitor the object to learn more about its composition and origins from outside our solar system.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions and U.S. tariff threats, analysts are debating whether Japan and South Korea might be pushed toward greater economic cooperation with China. While experts believe both nations are unlikely to abandon their strategic alliance with Washington, the economic pressure could create an opening for Beijing to offer stronger incentives for trilateral collaboration. The pragmatic, less ideological approaches of Japanese and Korean leaders may lead them to pursue stable ties with China as a counterbalance to volatile U.S. trade policies.

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and professionals have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce inflammatory comments made by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire. Maguire posted on social media that Zohran Mamdani, a Muslim Democratic mayoral candidate in New York, "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and aims to advance an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls for Sequoia to condemn the remarks, investigate Maguire's behavior, and implement a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech, threatening broader public action if the firm does not respond.</p>

          <p>A joint memo from the Justice Department and the FBI has stated that a review of evidence in the Jeffrey Epstein case found no credible "client list" used for blackmail, a claim that has angered many right-wing influencers. The memo, which surfaced recently, contradicts long-held beliefs within some circles that a list of powerful co-conspirators existed and would be released, a theory previously fueled by comments from officials in the Trump administration. The document explains that while the government holds extensive evidence, much of it protects victim identities and does not implicate third parties, leading to accusations from critics that a cover-up is underway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is facing criticism for issuing an unexplained order that allows the Department of Homeland Security to deport asylum-seekers to third countries without due process, a practice central to the Trump administration's immigration policy. The decision, which lifted a lower court's injunction, provided no legal reasoning, a departure that commentators argue undermines the judicial process and rewards executive defiance. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent highlighted that the administration had violated the lower court's order, yet the majority's silent ruling effectively rewarded this noncompliance, setting a concerning precedent for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A recurring narrative suggests American children and young adults are facing a literacy crisis, but experts are divided on the extent of the problem. While some college professors report a decline in students' ability to engage with complex texts, others argue that every generation worries about the intellectual decline of the next. However, national test scores from the NAEP show a clear decline in reading proficiency among younger students over the last decade, particularly among lower-achievers. This has sparked debate over teaching methods, the impact of technology, and whether current assessments capture the full scope of modern literacy.</p>

          <p>An investigation by CBS News discovered that Meta's Instagram platform was running paid advertisements that promoted escort and sex work services, a violation of its own policies. The ads, which appeared in Instagram Stories, linked to channels on the messaging app Telegram where users were explicitly offered access to women for "hot sex" and other services. In response to the findings, Meta removed the ads and the associated accounts, stating they violated the company's human exploitation and adult sexual solicitation policies. This follows recent struggles by Meta to combat a rise in sexualized ad content.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its economic pressure on the BRICS bloc of nations, threatening an additional 10% tariff on any country supporting what it deems "anti-American policies" aimed at undermining the U.S. dollar. This move comes as BRICS leaders convene and continue their push for de-dollarization by promoting trade in local currencies, a trend spearheaded by Russia and China in response to Western sanctions. While the bloc has expanded to represent nearly half the world's population, internal divisions and the dollar's continued global dominance present significant challenges to its ambitions.
