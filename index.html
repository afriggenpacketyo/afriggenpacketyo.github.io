        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil announced second-quarter earnings that, while significantly lower than the previous year, managed to exceed Wall Street's forecasts. This performance was largely attributed to a surge in production that helped offset the impact of declining oil prices. The company achieved its highest output in over two decades, reaching 4.6 million barrels per day, with record production also noted in the Permian Basin. The results demonstrate the oil major's ability to leverage operational efficiency to navigate a weaker price environment.</p>

          <p>China has implemented a new anti-money-laundering rule targeting dealers of precious metals and gems, a first for a non-financial sector. The regulation requires reporting any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (about US$13,870) to a financial crime watchdog within five working days. This move aims to close a significant loophole that was being exploited for illicit financial activities, expanding supervision beyond traditional financial institutions and tightening the country's oversight on potentially suspicious transactions.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Recent polling data reveals a significant drop in President Trump's approval rating among Gen Z voters, falling from 55% to 28% over six months. However, this growing dissatisfaction with Trump is not translating into a corresponding surge of support for the Democratic party. Analysts suggest that while young voters may be experiencing 'buyers' remorse,' they remain more evenly split between the two parties than in previous years. This trend points to a broader frustration and political disengagement among the youngest electorate.</p>

          <p>Strict limits on liquids in airline hand luggage may soon be lifted across the European Union, as new, officially approved CT scanners are deployed in airports. This advanced technology provides high-resolution 3D images, allowing security to detect liquid explosives without passengers needing to remove items from their bags. While the EU Commission has authorized the change, implementation will be gradual and at the discretion of individual airports, meaning most travelers must still adhere to the 100ml rule for the time being.</p>

The production is a highlight of the Edinburgh International Festival, where Cox portrays the ghost of economist Adam Smith. In the article, Cox reflects on his working-class roots in Dundee, which he says informs his focus on social inequality and his desire to use his platform for protest, stating he believes in giving people a better chance in life.</p>

          <p>An ongoing trade dispute with the United States, marked by a sharp increase in U.S. tariffs, has resulted in increased prices for Canadian consumers on various everyday goods. Canada's retaliatory tariffs, coupled with U.S. levies on metals, have driven up costs for items like appliances, cars, and groceries such as ketchup and canned soup. The article details how these tariffs directly impact household expenses, with some retailers even labeling affected products to inform customers of the price increases.</p>

This has forced expeditions to alter their schedules, often climbing at night to avoid the warmer, more hazardous daytime conditions, and poses a long-term threat to mountain tourism economies in regions like Nepal and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>This article explains the concept of parasocial relationships, the one-sided sense of intimacy people develop with public figures like celebrities, influencers, or podcasters. These connections feel social but are not reciprocal, an illusion fostered by mass media and the curated intimacy of social media. The piece traces the history of fandom from 'Beatlemania' to modern 'stan culture,' noting that while often positive, these relationships can become toxic when fans feel entitled to a celebrity's private life, blurring the lines between the public persona and the actual person.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How Intel Fell from Top US Chipmaker as Nvidia Rose to AI Dominance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Once the most valuable U.S. chipmaker, Intel has fallen significantly behind competitors like Nvidia, which has capitalized on the artificial intelligence boom. Analysts point to a series of strategic missteps, including passing on the original iPhone chip, and manufacturing delays that allowed rivals to gain market share. While Intel's market value has plummeted, Nvidia's has soared past $4 trillion. Under new leadership, Intel is attempting a costly turnaround focused on its foundry business, but faces a tough road to compete in the fast-growing AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ella Berman's new novel, "L.A. Women," is set in the iconic Laurel Canyon scene of the 1960s and 70s, exploring the complex relationship between two female writers, Lane and Gala. The story, driven by Gala's mysterious disappearance, delves into themes of friendship, professional rivalry, and the pressures faced by women in a male-dominated culture. The review praises Berman's ability to capture how attachment can warp into envy and how the cultural landscape of the era conspired to pit the two protagonists against each other, forcing them to commodify their lives and relationships.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Democratic Rhetoric on Masculinity Is Driving Male Voters to Trump</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the Democratic Party and progressive culture are alienating young male voters by frequently portraying masculinity in a negative light. The author cites recent focus groups and media commentary as evidence that many men feel criticized and overlooked, leading them to disengage from the left. This sense of alienation, the piece argues, makes them more receptive to Donald Trump's messaging. The author suggests that Democrats could win back these voters by adopting a more inclusive tone and addressing their concerns directly.</p>

          <p>Despite a statewide ban, foie gras, a product made from the force-fed livers of ducks or geese, has been found for sale in several Wild Fork Foods stores in Southern California. The sale violates a 2012 California law prohibiting the sale of any product resulting from the force-feeding of a bird. After being contacted by journalists, the stores appeared to have removed the product from their shelves.

          <p>British Member of Parliament Tulip Siddiq is scheduled to face trial in Bangladesh on August 11 over allegations of corruption. The Labour MP is accused of illegally obtaining land by using her influence with the former administration of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina. Siddiq, who resigned from her ministerial role in January to avoid being a distraction, has denied the allegations, with her lawyers describing the case as a "politically motivated smear campaign."
