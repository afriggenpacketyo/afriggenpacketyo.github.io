          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 18 counts, including unlawful transmission and retention of classified documents. Prosecutors allege he used a personal email to send highly sensitive national defense information, such as intelligence on foreign adversaries and U.S. covert actions, to unauthorized relatives. Bolton strongly refutes these charges, characterizing them as political retribution from former President Donald Trump, who previously attempted to block his tell-all book. This indictment adds to a pattern of charges against individuals perceived as Trump's political opponents, sparking debate over the weaponization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Dr. Hu Ye, a leading biomedical scientist specializing in rapid virus detection and nanomedicine, has departed the United States for China following significant cuts to his National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. His research projects, which included a US$3.7 million grant for early detection of tuberculosis and HIV in children, were impacted by over US$8 million in funding reductions. Hu, an associate editor of ACS Nano journal and co-founder of four biotech startups, had previously voiced concerns about these freezes. His move underscores a growing concern regarding the retention of top scientific talent and the potential implications of funding instability on critical research initiatives in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani seemingly reversed his stance on Hamas disarming during a recent debate, now affirming that he believes they should lay down their weapons. This public declaration followed a Fox News interview where he had notably sidestepped questions about Hamas's future and disarmament, claiming his opinions were limited to justice and safety. Mamdani, who has been a vocal proponent for a ceasefire, reiterated that all involved parties must halt hostilities to ensure unimpeded humanitarian aid and achieve a lasting peace. His sudden policy shift has garnered significant attention and criticism, especially given his recent controversial positions on Israel.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a downturn, tracking Wall Street's losses amidst escalating fears surrounding the U.S. banking sector and persistent trade tensions. Shares of several regional banks and investment firm Jefferies notably declined in the U.S., driven by mounting concerns over potentially problematic loans. Major indices across the region, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi, saw dips in early trading, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also opened weaker. Conversely, Singapore reported a significant and unexpected rebound in its non-oil domestic exports, offering a contrasting positive economic signal against the backdrop of wider market apprehension.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The societal taboo around discussing sweat is diminishing, influenced by celebrities like Alan Carr on "The Traitors" and a broader cultural shift. High-profile figures, including Emma Stone and Adele, have openly shared their experiences with perspiration, normalizing a previously private bodily function. This change is also evident in the rise of "sweat suits," the activewear brand Sweaty Betty, and the growing popularity of saunas for business networking, particularly among professionals adopting Finnish traditions. While some marketing strategies may capitalize on body positivity, the trend suggests a move towards greater comfort and acceptance regarding natural bodily processes, despite skepticism from some experts about commercial exploitation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to lift an order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the administration's plan a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. The court also concluded there was insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" against the U.S. government or that regular forces were unable to execute the law. This decision maintains the temporary restraining order against deploying federalized Guardsmen within Illinois, despite President Trump's assertions that troops were needed for crime prevention in Chicago and to protect immigration facilities.</p>

Financial analysts note that eateries serving lower- and middle-income consumers are particularly vulnerable, as these groups face broad cost pressures. The National Restaurant Association advocates for exemptions from Trump administration tariffs, warning that current conditions could necessitate a 30.3% menu price hike just to maintain thin profit margins.

          <p>Venezuelan fishermen, including Wilder Fernández, are experiencing profound fear following recent US military strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean, with at least 27 fatalities reported. The US, deploying warships and thousands of troops, asserts these operations target "narco-terrorists" allegedly linked to President Nicolás Maduro's government, an accusation Maduro denies. Concerns are rising among fishermen about accidental casualties, leading some to consider leaving their profession, while others express defiance and rally in support of their government. Legal experts have also questioned the international legality of these strikes, adding to the regional instability and human anxiety.</p>

The administration claims these operations are part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, intensifying pressure on Venezuela's government. However, the strikes have drawn criticism from lawmakers who question the absence of congressional authorization and the lack of publicly provided evidence that the boats were indeed carrying narcotics.</p>

This significant influx of moisture has also replenished California's reservoirs, with most now registering at or above historical levels for this period.

          <p>Two individuals linked to the notorious MS-13 street gang have been convicted on multiple felony counts for a brutal and coordinated attack on a Southern California couple in October 2018. Jose Rafael Andrademembreno and Edwin Diaz ambushed Marco Morales and his girlfriend in their apartment's hot tub, stabbing Morales over 18 times with a machete, eventually piercing his skull. The girlfriend survived a pocketknife attack. Prosecutors revealed the attack stemmed from a dispute over a rifle sale and highlighted the perpetrators' callous behavior, including laughing as they fled. This conviction underscores the severity of gang violence and brings a measure of justice to the victims.</p>

          <p>Indiana University has controversially ordered its student-run newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to halt printing news content and subsequently fired Jim Rodenbush, the school's director of student media and paper's adviser. Students and free expression advocates, including the Student Press Law Center, denounce these actions as unlawful censorship, alleging Rodenbush was terminated for resisting the print content restrictions. The university maintains it is transitioning resources to a digital-first model and addressing financial deficits, asserting that IDS editorial control remains independent. However, the IDS responded by publishing a digital front page emblazoned with "CENSORED," declaring a "breach of editorial independence" and drawing widespread condemnation from various free expression groups.</p>

          <p>Nick Mackenzie, CEO of Greene King, a prominent UK brewer and pub chain with 2,700 sites, identifies cafes and delivery applications as significant new rivals to traditional pubs. He notes that consumers are increasingly choosing non-alcoholic options and at-home delivery, leading to a shift in leisure time away from pubs. With approximately one-third of under-25s and 20% of all Britons abstaining from alcohol, pubs are adapting by improving their coffee offerings and integrating "competitive socialising" elements like electronic dartboards. Mackenzie stresses the enduring community value of pubs while navigating these evolving consumer preferences and wellness trends to maintain relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Atlantic critiques a disturbing trend of overt racism and bigotry permeating American political discourse, asserting that such sentiments are now openly expressed rather than subtly implied. Recent examples include Young Republicans' group chats containing racist and anti-Semitic remarks, the Trump administration's consideration of a refugee policy favoring "white South Africans and Europeans," and the circulation of anti-Semitic content by Border Patrol. The article links these developments to Donald Trump's past rhetoric and judicial appointments, arguing that a potent current of racism is elevating white people while marginalizing others. It posits that the freedom to use offensive language without social repercussions has become a central appeal for certain segments of the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>Vice President J. D. Vance defended Young Republican leaders involved in a group chat containing rampant bigotry and "I love Hitler" remarks, refusing to "pearl clutch." Vance dismissed the participants as "kids" and their comments as "edgy jokes," despite many being high-level Republican staffers in their 20s and 30s. The Atlantic article argues Vance's response is a "deflection" strategy, common when allies' behavior is too toxic to defend but too widespread within a coalition to repudiate. This defense highlights a transformation of conservative political norms in the Trump era, where open displays of authoritarian and racist views are increasingly tolerated within the party.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer contends that mounting concerns over problematic bank loans will likely accelerate the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates, a development keenly anticipated by investors. He asserts that credit losses, highlighted by recent bankruptcies in the auto industry and substantial loan losses reported by institutions such as Zions Bancorporation, serve as clear indicators of an economic slowdown. Cramer suggests these "bad loans" offer the Fed a compelling rationale to reduce rates without undue apprehension regarding inflation, as reduced borrowing costs can mitigate further defaults. He optimistically believes the financial fallout will be largely confined to the banking sector, sparing the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

Norris accepted responsibility, emphasizing the team's foundational principle of avoiding collisions between teammates, even for minor contact. While the specific repercussions remain undisclosed by both Norris and McLaren, the event underscores the delicate balance teams must strike between fostering competitive racing and preventing internal conflict, particularly as Norris currently trails Piastri in the championship score.</p>
