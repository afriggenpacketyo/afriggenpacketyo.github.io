          <p>Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has sent a harsh letter to Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, condemning the university's handling of antisemitism on campus. McMahon advises Harvard to refrain from applying for future federal grants, stating they will not be provided due to Harvard's alleged violations of federal law and misuse of taxpayer funds. She also criticizes Harvard for plagiarism scandals, "ugly racism," and hiring former mayors with questionable leadership records. Harvard responded by stating they will continue to comply with the law, combat antisemitism, and defend against government overreach.</p>

          <p>A declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct its movement to the U.S. The release of this memo further weakens the Trump administration's justification for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador, and raises questions about the Justice Department's investigation into media coverage of the issue.</p>

          <p>A study led by Peking University has found that migratory pests from mainland Southeast Asia, thriving under El NiÃ±o conditions, are contributing to rice yield losses in southern China. The researchers emphasize the importance of collaborative, international pest control strategies to ensure food security in the region. Warm, humid weather during El NiÃ±o years creates favorable breeding conditions for the pests, while wind gusts facilitate their migration to southern China.</p>
