          <p>Intel released its first-quarter results, surpassing analyst expectations but issuing a disappointing revenue forecast for the current quarter and revealing plans to reduce operational and capital expenses.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Venezuelan man who was deported to El Salvador, stating that the deportation violated a previous court settlement. The judge referenced the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, ordering the government to bring back the individual, referred to as 'Cristian,' so that his asylum application can be adjudicated. The deportation was deemed a breach of contract, with the Trump administration arguing that Cristian's designation as an alien enemy exempted him from the settlement.

Spitzer claims the release is due to California's lenient credit system, while Newsom's office argues that the DA's office dropped key charges. Following media attention, Newsom's office agreed to comply with an ICE detainer, and the Department of Justice announced federal charges against Ortega-Anguiano.

Despite the loss, Littler remains at the top of the table and is on track to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs. He was visibly emotional as he left the stage after the match.</p>

Hogg, a DNC vice-chair, has pledged to spend $20 million to primary 'ineffective' Democrats through his organization, Leaders We Deserve. Martin stated that DNC officers cannot be both 'the referee and also the player,' potentially forcing Hogg to choose between his party position and his organization's mission. If approved, the neutrality pledge would prevent DNC officials from supporting primary challengers.</p>
