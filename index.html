          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed David A. Wright to a five-year term as the chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), an independent agency overseeing nuclear energy safety. The confirmation was largely along party lines, following a contentious debate over the agency's independence and direction. Democrats raised concerns about a potential "hostile takeover" after President Trump urged the agency to loosen safety standards to boost nuclear power capacity. The confirmation is seen as a victory for the administration's agenda to advance its nominees.</p>

          <p>California State Parks has launched a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to campsites at three of its most popular campgrounds: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. This change addresses years of frustration from campers who saw reservations vanish within minutes of becoming available. The system, which is free to enter, aims to level the playing field by giving more people a fair chance to book a spot. Unsuccessful applicants will receive points to increase their odds in future drawings, a model based on a successful pilot program.</p>

          <p>In a landmark case, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been convicted of bribery and witness tampering, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. A Bogotá judge ruled that Uribe attempted to bribe a jailed ex-paramilitary member to prevent him from testifying about Uribe's alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case, which could result in a sentence of up to 12 years, stems from a long-running investigation that has deeply divided the nation.</p>

The USDA claims the data is needed to combat fraud, but critics point to the administration's history of using similar justifications to obtain data for immigration enforcement.

While this can align his perspective with the public's, it also makes him susceptible to manipulation and narrows his understanding of complex issues. This approach contrasts sharply with the vast intelligence resources available to a president, creating a unique and often unpredictable style of governance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by an investment fund that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The ruling affirmed that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" requiring open government meetings. The lawsuit was filed by Azoria Capital, whose CEO is an ally of President Trump and has been critical of the Fed's policies. The judge questioned whether the lawsuit was a publicity stunt to generate interest in the new fund.</p>

Bad Bunny's "Debí Tirar Más Fotos" and Natalia Lafourcade's "Cancionera" are seen as top contenders for Album of the Year, representing both the innovative, commercial power of urbano and the masterful craft of traditional forms. Other potential nominees include Rauw Alejandro, Fuerza Regida, and Becky G, whose works have pushed genre boundaries and reflect a broader trend of artists reconnecting with their cultural roots while forging new sounds.</p>

          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the January wildfires caused $51.7 billion in damage to residential properties within Los Angeles city limits. The analysis focused on the Palisades fire, which destroyed thousands of homes in wealthy neighborhoods where the average pre-fire home value was $3.7 million. The fire, which killed at least 12 people, is considered one of the most destructive in state history. This figure does not include damage to commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic loss is even higher.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic rift has emerged as President Trump publicly contradicted Israeli claims that images of starvation in Gaza are "fake." Trump stated, "you can't fake that," and asserted the U.S. would increase aid efforts, even as an Israeli military spokesman dismissed the visuals as a Hamas campaign. The disagreement comes amid growing international pressure and as two Israeli human rights groups have characterized the situation as a genocide. The Israeli government defended its official's remarks, blaming the U.N. for poor aid distribution rather than a lack of supply.</p>

          <p>An inquest has heard that a 23-year-old woman, Paloma Shemirani, died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma after refusing conventional chemotherapy. She had described herself as "anti-vax" and, influenced by her mother, a prominent COVID-19 conspiracy theorist, opted for an unproven alternative diet-based therapy instead. The young woman had previously denied her diagnosis and expressed fears that chemotherapy could cause infertility.

This move suggests that aircraft purchases could become a key area of cooperation if broader trade talks between Washington and Beijing prove successful. Boeing has often been caught in the crossfire of U.S.-China trade tensions, but industry insiders believe the aerospace giant is well-positioned to benefit from any diplomatic thaw. The survey follows a meeting between the regulator's director and a senior Boeing executive to discuss expanding cooperation.</p>

The family of six, who have a British relative, were granted permission to come to the UK but were denied assistance in leaving Gaza. The court ruled that while the government is not required to help, it must re-evaluate its decision given the "legally exceptional" nature of the family's situation, as they live at "constant risk of injury or death" in a tent.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned the deal would "substantially damage" his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called it an act of "submission." The agreement, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to avert a higher rate, was seen by many as a necessary evil to prevent a full-blown trade war. However, there was little celebration, with most leaders acknowledging it as an uneven compromise made under difficult circumstances.</p>
