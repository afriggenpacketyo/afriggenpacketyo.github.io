        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex factors that contribute to the development of sexual orientation, highlighting that it is not a choice but rather a result of biological and psychosocial influences during puberty. Experts emphasize that no single factor determines a person's sexual orientation, but rather a combination of genetic makeup, hormones, and social factors play a role. The article underscores that sexual orientation is stable throughout life, and attempts to change it through conversion therapies have been unsuccessful. The piece also stresses the importance of societal acceptance and unbiased discussions about sexual diversity to support individuals' self-esteem and mental health. The article concludes that no sexual orientation is a disease or unnatural, as social norms dictate tolerance and acceptance.</p>

          <p>A high school in Germany is under investigation after students proposed Nazi slogans as graduation mottos, sparking a national debate about right-wing extremism among youth. The incident, which included slogans referencing Nazi extermination camps and book burnings, has led to calls for mandatory visits to concentration camp memorials for all students. Experts note an increase in antisemitic incidents in schools, reflecting a broader societal shift where extremist views are becoming more acceptable. Teachers face challenges in addressing these issues, highlighting the need for support and courage to stand up for democratic values, with some feeling that the Holocaust feels increasingly distant to students.</p>

          <p>Team USA flag football player Darrell Doucette III is advocating for current national team members to have the opportunity to compete for Olympic roster spots alongside NFL players when flag football debuts at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Doucette emphasizes the dedication and hard work of existing flag football players who have elevated the sport, and he welcomes competition while asserting the team's current ability to win gold. He believes the team is already the best at the sport and doesn't necessarily need NFL players, but he is open to competition. Doucette previously stated that he believes he is better than Patrick Mahomes at flag football due to his high IQ of the game.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Arkansas are conducting a manhunt for Grant Hardin, a former police chief who escaped from a high-security prison where he was serving a sentence for first-degree murder and sexual assault. Hardin, 56, was able to escape dressed in a makeshift law enforcement uniform, and is considered extremely dangerous by officials. Prior to his convictions, Hardin had a history of terminations from law enforcement positions due to excessive force and falsifying police reports. The Stone County Sheriff’s Office is urging residents not to approach him, and roadblocks are in place as officials fear he may take a hostage or steal a vehicle.</p>

Domestic factories producing batteries for energy storage face rising costs due to tariffs, and potential subsidy restrictions could further hinder their competitiveness. The industry plays a crucial role in balancing energy supply and demand, particularly in states with renewable energy sources, but uncertainty surrounding trade policy is causing companies to delay projects. Without batteries, utilities would need to invest more in expensive power plants and transmission lines, driving up electricity prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli air strikes on Gaza have resulted in the deaths of at least 54 Palestinians, with a significant number of fatalities occurring at a school sheltering displaced families. The Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, housing hundreds of people, was struck, resulting in numerous casualties, including children. The IDF stated it targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. International concern has grown over the civilian death toll, with the ICRC reporting the deaths of two staff members in a separate strike.</p>

          <p>India has launched a diplomatic offensive by sending parliamentary delegations to 33 countries to garner support for its "zero tolerance" policy on terrorism, following an attack in India-administered Kashmir. The delegations are equipped with dossiers detailing Pakistan's alleged history of fostering terrorism and evidence linking the attack to Pakistan-based groups. Pakistan has denied involvement and is also conducting its own diplomatic outreach. Experts suggest India's efforts aim to present its strikes on Pakistan as legitimate self-defense under international law, while building international support against terrorism.</p>

The investigation follows accusations that Keir Starmer, a UK politician, echoed Powell's language on immigration.

          <p>Russia is intensifying its attacks on Ukrainian cities as the United States reduces its involvement in the conflict. A recent large-scale aerial bombardment saw hundreds of drones and missiles targeting Ukrainian cities, resulting in civilian casualties. This escalation follows President Trump's criticism of Putin but also indicates a reluctance to provide further military assistance to Ukraine. With U.S. support waning, analysts suggest Russia sees an opportunity to press its advantage, while Ukraine faces shortages of interceptor missiles and struggles to defend against increasingly sophisticated Russian weaponry.</p>

This strategy lowers public awareness of noncompliance and could lead to courts legalizing partial noncompliance to avoid outright defiance.
