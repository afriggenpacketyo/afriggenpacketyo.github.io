          <p>Brendan Buck, a former counselor to House Speaker Paul Ryan, argues that congressional Republicans are in a precarious position due to President Trump's tariffs. While Republicans aim to extend the 2017 tax law to boost the economy, Trump's tariffs threaten to undermine these efforts by raising costs and battering markets. Buck suggests that Republican leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy or reclaim Congress's authority over tariffs. The article suggests that without a stable economy, House members in battleground districts face a difficult path to re-election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reports on India's strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, following a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry stated the strikes, named "Operation Sindoor," were in response to the April 22 attack that resulted in 26 deaths, while Pakistan has denied involvement and described the strikes as "unprovoked." Pakistan claims to have shot down Indian aircraft, while India alleges civilian casualties due to Pakistani shelling. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with both sides taking measures against each other in recent weeks.</p>

His comments came during testimony in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet, which focuses on Google's dominance in advertising technology markets and its agreements with platform providers like Apple. The article suggests that Cue's comments cast doubt on the long-term stability of the relationship between Apple and Google, as searches on Safari have begun to decline due to the rise in AI usage.</p>

          <p>In response to state laws in Utah and Idaho that restrict the display of unofficial flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags. Salt Lake City approved flags with rainbow, transgender Pride, and Juneteenth symbols, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and an organ donation flag as official. These actions are seen as a way to circumvent state laws that civil rights groups believe target flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people. The Utah House speaker criticized Salt Lake City's move as a waste of time and taxpayer resources.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are reintroducing the "SAFE Home Act," which aims to prevent agencies receiving federal funding from discriminating against prospective adoptive parents who prefer to raise a child of their biological sex. The bill, sponsored by Sens. Jim Banks and Tom Cotton, and Rep. Mary Miller, ensures adoptive parents aren't required to provide gender-affirming treatments to children. The legislation is partially inspired by a Biden-era HHS rule promoting homes that affirm a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill seeks to protect parental rights and counteract what Republicans see as dangerous gender ideologies.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is approaching its policy decision amid uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and conflicting economic signals. With the economy showing both strengths and weaknesses, the Fed is expected to maintain its current interest rate policy. Market expectations have shifted, with futures markets indicating a low probability of a rate cut at the upcoming meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely address the recent economic data and the Fed's outlook, emphasizing that all options are on the table for future policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The European Union will announce further details of its proposed countermeasures to U.S. tariffs. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated that the EU continues to prepare for any scenario should current trade talks fail, but that negotiations come first. Trump initially imposed a tariff on all goods coming from the EU, then lowered the duty for 90 days for negotiations. The EU has paused its retaliatory measures, which target around 21 billion euros worth of U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, many linked to climate change and diversity initiatives. The cuts, detailed in an internal agency document, could save $26 million by canceling grants to universities, state historic preservation offices, tribes, and youth corps. Programs targeted for elimination include Scientists in Parks, climate resiliency studies, watershed protection efforts, and projects supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Critics argue that the cuts will harm public safety and the assessment of environmental conditions.</p>

          <p>Traditional economic measures are slow to reflect the impact of President Trump’s trade wars, prompting economists to seek alternative sources of data, including earnings calls and private-sector information. Evidence such as declining spending at McDonald’s and fewer container ships at the Port of Los Angeles, suggest the impact of tariffs and uncertainty. Economists are divided on how tariffs will manifest, whether through higher prices, product shortages, or layoffs. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these unconventional indicators to inform monetary policy decisions.</p>

However, some feminists have criticized the name's association with traditionally defined gender roles.
