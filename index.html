For four hours, travelers were stuck without air conditioning or working toilets before being evacuated to a replacement train. Eurostar has apologized for the significant disruption and discomfort, offering affected customers a full refund and additional compensation for the ordeal. The delay was compounded by a slow transfer process to the rescue train.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was halted due to a failure in the electronic line-calling system. The system failed to call a clear out ball from Kartal, leading the umpire to replay the point, which Pavlyuchenkova argued cost her the game. The All England Club attributed the malfunction to operator error and confirmed the umpire followed established procedure. Pavlyuchenkova, who ultimately won the match, criticized the system and called for video reviews.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," after a public falling out with President Trump over a major tax and spending bill. Musk, who briefly headed a government efficiency department, criticized the bill for increasing the national deficit and declared the new party would restore freedom. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reacted by suggesting Musk should focus on his businesses rather than politics, noting investors were likely displeased. The move signals a renewed and intense feud between the two influential figures.</p>

          <p>The collapse of Libya's healthcare system is driving citizens to risk their lives on dangerous sea crossings to Europe for medical treatment. The story of a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, whose family journeyed to Italy on a smuggler's boat, has highlighted the crisis. Since 2011, political instability has decimated Libya's medical infrastructure, leaving many without access to essential medicines and care. This desperation forces families to choose between watching their loved ones suffer or undertaking perilous, illicit migration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Military experts writing in the official PLA Daily have stated that China's military needs to undergo structural changes to effectively defend against modern drone threats. They argue that recent conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, have demonstrated the crucial role of unmanned aircraft. The experts suggest the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will likely establish specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid response. In the interim, they propose integrating counter-drone capabilities into existing formations, such as upgrading electronic warfare units.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has defended the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, calling recent efforts by the White House to eliminate its funding "foolhardy" and "misguided." In an interview, Burns argued that defunding public media disproportionately harms rural areas where PBS may be the only available signal. He stressed the importance of PBS for educational programming, emergency information, and providing the time necessary to create in-depth historical films. Burns's comments come as the Trump administration has targeted public media, claiming it spreads propaganda.</p>

          <p>With a deadline just days away, European Union leaders are grappling with how to secure a trade deal with the U.S. to avoid President Trump's threatened tariffs. There is a split among member states, with Germany favoring a quick deal to prevent a trade war, while France advocates for holding out for a better agreement. The EU is aiming for a "framework deal," as a full comprehensive agreement is now seen as unattainable before the deadline. European industries are bracing for higher costs, with a baseline 10% tariff on exports seen as a likely minimum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR producer in Gaza has provided a harrowing first-person account of the dangers Palestinians face trying to obtain food from a new U.S.-supported distribution program. The journalist describes dodging Israeli military fire, facing armed private contractors, and fighting through desperate crowds to get minimal rations. He details a scene of total lawlessness, where hunger drives people to violence and thieves prey on those leaving with food. The report underscores the UN's description of the program as a "death trap," with many reportedly killed or wounded while seeking aid.</p>

          <p>A 3,500-year-old city named Peñico has been discovered in Peru's northern Barranca province, shedding new light on the region's ancient civilizations. Researchers believe the city, founded between 1800 and 1500 BC, served as a crucial trading hub connecting coastal communities with those in the Andes and Amazon. The site contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes where artifacts like clay sculptures and shell necklaces were found. This discovery is significant for understanding societies that emerged after the decline of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization.</p>

Camarena's brutal murder marked a turning point in the U.S. war on drugs and led to a massive operation to dismantle the cartel.
