          <p>A 20-year-old student, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers during a violent incident at Manchester Airport in July of last year. One officer suffered a broken nose in the attack, which was captured on mobile phone footage. The jury convicted Amaaz of assault causing actual bodily harm and assault of an emergency worker. The Greater Manchester Police Federation highlighted the verdict as an example of the dangers officers face, noting that 35 officers are assaulted in the region every week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped its criminal case against restaurant company FAT Brands and its chair, Andy Wiederhorn. The indictment, filed in May 2024, included charges of wire fraud and tax evasion related to an alleged $47 million "sham" loan scheme. Wiederhorn, who has consistently maintained his innocence, expressed relief and a desire to focus on the company's growth. The dismissal follows a leadership shake-up at the DOJ, though the company still faces a separate civil complaint from the SEC over the same allegations.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl and her 13-year-old brother from Britain have tragically drowned at Llarga beach in Salou, Spain. The incident occurred on Tuesday evening when the children and their father struggled in rough sea conditions. While the father was rescued, the two children could not be saved despite emergency efforts. Local authorities noted that the beach had a yellow flag, advising caution, and that lifeguards had finished their shifts for the day. The tragedy has prompted renewed calls for caution on Catalan beaches, which have seen 16 fatalities this summer.</p>

          <p>The U.S. apartment rental market is showing signs of cooling as a surge in new supply pushes vacancy rates to a multi-year high of 7.1% in July. According to a report from Apartment List, this oversupply has stalled rent growth during the peak moving season, with the national median rent remaining flat at $1,402. Rents are down 0.8% year-over-year, with the most significant declines seen in southern and Mountain West cities like Austin, Texas. This shift creates a more favorable market for renters, though macroeconomic uncertainty complicates the long-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

For consumers, the bill mandates that agents disclose their physical location and whether AI is being used, with an option to transfer to a U.S.-based human representative.

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprising resilience by growing at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts. This rebound follows a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter and was largely driven by a sharp 30.3% drop in imports, a consequence of the Trump administration's tariffs. Consumer spending also increased by 1.4%, though a key metric for underlying private sector demand showed a slowdown. The strong headline number prompted President Trump to renew his call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientists Warn EU Climate Targets Are at Risk as Damaged Forests Absorb Less Carbon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is under threat because its forests are absorbing significantly less CO2, a new scientific paper warns. Researchers found that the amount of carbon removed by Europe's forests from 2020-2022 was nearly one-third lower than a decade earlier. This decline is attributed to increased logging, wildfires, droughts, and pests, all of which are damaging forest health and resilience. The trend casts doubt on the EU's strategy, which relies heavily on forests acting as a growing carbon sink to offset industrial pollution.</p>

          <p>In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have found vibrant communities of chemosynthetic creatures, such as tube worms and clams, at depths of over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean. These ecosystems, located in the Kuril-Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches, do not rely on sunlight but instead derive energy from chemical-rich fluids seeping from the seafloor. The discovery pushes the known depth limit for such life by nearly 25%, revealing an "oasis in the vast desert of the deep sea." The findings expand our understanding of how life can flourish in extreme environments on Earth and potentially elsewhere.</p>

Streeting warned the union that the recent industrial action had "squandered the considerable goodwill" it had with the government. The BMA is seeking a pay rise to counteract what it says is a 20% real-terms pay cut since 2008.</p>

He also criticized the country for its significant purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia. The White House stated that the U.S. has a massive trade deficit with India and that the new tariffs are intended to remedy a situation where India's market has been "pretty much closed to American products."</p>

Waves several feet high were recorded, and while the initial warning was later downgraded to an advisory, officials urged continued caution. The event caused significant disruption, including the opening of shelters and the shutdown of water facilities to prevent damage.</p>

          <p>As the Ethereum network marks its 10th anniversary, its outlook is viewed as increasingly bright, despite its native token, ether, having underperformed in recent years. Growing institutional interest is being driven by new U.S. crypto legislation, the IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, and a boom in corporate adoption for tokenizing traditional assets. While it has faced competition from faster blockchains like Solana, experts believe Ethereum's core strength of decentralization remains its key advantage. This positions it well to become the foundational platform for the next wave of institutional finance on the blockchain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article, a transcript from The David Frum Show, presents a detailed critique of the Trump administration's tariff policies, arguing they are economically self-harming. The analysis refutes the claim that tariffs boost domestic manufacturing, explaining that they raise input costs and make U.S. exports less competitive. The author contends that tariffs function as a regressive tax, disproportionately burdening lower-income households who spend more on goods. The piece concludes that the policy alienates allies, slows economic growth, and shifts the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor under the guise of protectionism. (not investment advice)</p>
