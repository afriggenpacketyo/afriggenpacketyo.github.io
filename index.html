          <p>French authorities suspect arson in a major power outage in southeast France, potentially jeopardizing the Cannes Film Festival's closing ceremony. The power outage, affecting approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, occurred after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes and the collapse of a high-voltage line. Despite the disruptions, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme dâ€™Or ceremony, would proceed as planned using an independent power supply. Authorities are investigating the incidents, condemning them as acts of damage to electrical infrastructures.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's "It Was Just an Accident," an Iranian film shot in secret, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a triumphant moment for the director who was previously banned from making movies in Iran. The film follows a group of men and women who band together after one of them kidnaps a man they believe tortured them in prison, drawing inspiration from Panahi's own experiences as a political prisoner. The award capped what was widely seen as one of the strongest festivals in years, with other notable winners including Joachim Trier's "Sentimental Value" and Kleber MendonÃ§a Filho's "The Secret Agent."</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump successfully passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" after a 72-hour marathon of vote wrangling, marking a major legislative achievement for Trump's second term. Despite skepticism from the Washington political establishment and media, Johnson's strategic planning and Trump's personal involvement were crucial in securing the bill's passage. The bill, made possible through the reconciliation process, faced conflicting concerns from various factions within the Republican party, but Trump and Johnson managed to keep the conference on track.

          <p>An East African crowned crane named Alice escaped from a Washington state zoo and was found several days later after being spotted strolling on neighborhood streets and spending time with a group of "blue herons." Cougar Mountain Zoo officials documented Alice's adventures on social media, and concerned residents reported sightings to the zoo's dedicated phone line. Alice was eventually retrieved from a resident's yard near Lake Sammamish and returned to the zoo, where she was welcomed home by her bonded partner, Hatter.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution and informing U.S. authorities about his experiences of sexual assault. Judge Brian Murphy criticized the government for claiming that O.C.G. said he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico, where he had been previously sexually assaulted and held captive. The judge found that O.C.G. was likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process, adding another challenge to President Trump's deportation policies in federal courts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, despite his fears of harm in both countries. The man, who is gay, was protected from deportation under a U.S. immigration judge's order. Judge Brian Murphy found that the deportation lacked due process, noting the man's claims of sexual assault in Mexico. The order adds to a series of court findings against Trump administration deportations, highlighting concerns over due process and the treatment of asylum seekers.</p>
