          <p>After a five-year pause, the Trump Administration has restarted collection efforts on defaulted student loans, potentially impacting 5.3 million borrowers. The Treasury Department will notify affected individuals about wage garnishment, which could begin this summer. Experts note this aggressive approach sharply contrasts with the relief measures extended during the Covid-19 pandemic. There is particular concern about the consequences for retirees, who could see their Social Security benefits reduced, potentially leading to financial hardship. </p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump at the White House for the first time since taking office, with both leaders acknowledging strained relations due to tariffs and trade disputes.

Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, has vowed to stand firm against the U.S. president and negotiate trade and security talks on Canada's terms.

          <p>States have been using taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal matching funds, a practice that congressional Republicans are now considering curtailing. This maneuver, known as a Medicaid provider tax, allows states to inflate Medicaid spending on paper and collect more matching funds from the federal government. If Republicans succeed in ending this tactic, it could save the federal government approximately $600 billion over the next decade. However, it could hit some Republican-led states the hardest, as their Medicaid budgets tend to be more reliant on this strategy.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, likely jeopardizing Martin's confirmation. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot as his reason for not supporting the nomination. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination is unlikely to be reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term will expire on May 20.</p>

The body of the black bear suspected in the death of 89-year-old Robert Markel was removed from woodland. Markel’s body was found a couple of hundred yards away from the dog that had also been killed by a bear. The commission has recorded 43 human-bear encounters in Florida dating back to 2006, excluding vehicle strikes, and almost all of them also involving a dog.</p>

          <p>Co-op stores have experienced delivery delays and empty shelves following a major cyber attack, although the company says payment issues have been resolved. The retailer confirmed that the attack on its systems has resulted in "significant" amounts of customer data being stolen. The company has said that deliveries to its stores were impacted by the "sustained malicious attempts by hackers to access our systems". The company said it believes only members' personal data such as names, contact details and dates of birth - not bank details, transaction information, or passwords - have been extracted.</p>

          <p>After three years of discussions, the UK and India have reached a trade agreement that will reduce trade barriers between the two nations. The agreement aims to increase trade by an additional £25.5 billion annually by 2040, with key features including reduced tariffs on UK exports like whisky and cars, and on Indian clothing and footwear. The agreement excludes changes to immigration policy. Both countries hail the agreement as a significant milestone that will boost economic growth, job creation, and innovation.</p>
