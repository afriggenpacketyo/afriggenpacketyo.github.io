          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, claiming they are gang members. The administration asserts that these migrants pose a danger, citing an incident where a group barricaded themselves in a detention center, threatened hostages, and caused damage. The solicitor general argues the government has a strong interest in removing dangerous gang members promptly, while lawyers for the detainees have not commented. The Supreme Court had previously temporarily blocked the deportations while considering the issue, but the administration is now pressing for a resolution, highlighting the urgency and potential risks involved in detaining these migrants. The article provides context on the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the migrants.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by recovery in the oil and gas sector and strong performance in tech and finance. The World Bank's report highlights the positive impact of President Bola Tinubu's reforms, including the removal of petrol subsidies and currency devaluation. However, the agriculture sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs, contributing to ongoing food price inflation. Despite the economic growth, poverty remains high, with nearly half the population living in poverty, and inflation is expected to remain above 20% this year. The article also mentions the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s praise for the reforms and warning about high poverty levels.</p>

          <p>Experts and doctors are debating who should be prescribed GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, considering factors beyond just weight. While the drugs are effective, they are expensive, often not covered by insurance, and can cause side effects. The focus should be on improving overall health, particularly reducing visceral fat, which is linked to various chronic diseases. Doctors need better ways to identify individuals with excess visceral fat, as BMI is not a reliable measure. The article emphasizes the importance of determining the long-term effects and safety of these drugs, especially since most people take them for less than a year.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called on drugmakers to lower their prices within a month to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening steep caps on Medicare earnings if they don't comply.
