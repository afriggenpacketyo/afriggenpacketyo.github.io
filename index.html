          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that major tech companies are not overspending on AI but are, in fact, underspending in a high-stakes, winner-take-all race. He points to Alphabet's strong earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification for aggressive investment in cloud infrastructure and AI services. While acknowledging skepticism about current AI chatbot capabilities, Cramer believes the company that develops the most accurate AI will dominate the market, comparing the potential to Google's original search engine monopoly.

          <p>Hunter Marquez, a top graduate from the Air Force Academy, has had their dream of becoming a second lieutenant put on hold due to the Trump administration's ban on transgender troops. Despite meeting all physical and academic requirements, Marquez was not commissioned with their peers and is now a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the ban. Experts cited in the article argue there is no evidence that transgender service members harm military readiness, while Marquez remains hopeful to serve if the policy is reversed.</p>

          <p>A significant military escalation occurred on the border between Thailand and Cambodia, resulting in at least 12 deaths in Thailand, primarily civilians. The conflict involved small arms, artillery, and Thai airstrikes, reportedly triggered by a landmine explosion that injured Thai soldiers. Both nations have sealed border crossings and engaged in diplomatic retaliation, with Cambodia accusing Thailand of aggression and requesting an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to de-escalate the situation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory obstacle for the deal. The approval, led by Trump-appointed Chairman Brendan Carr, followed a period of intense political scrutiny, including a controversial $16 million settlement Paramount paid to President Trump. As part of the deal, Skydance has committed to significant changes at CBS, including canceling all DEI initiatives and installing a news ombudsman to address claims of bias.</p>

These positions also tend to offer higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar jobs that do not require AI expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking permission to proceed with canceling hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. The grants in question, totaling roughly $783 million, were targeted for termination under executive orders aimed at eliminating funding for research related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and gender identity. A lower court had previously blocked the cancellations, but the administration is now asking the high court to overturn that decision and allow the policy to take effect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The suit, announced by Attorney General Pam Bondi, claims the city's policies obstruct federal law enforcement and endanger public safety by releasing criminals onto the streets. This legal action follows promises by border czar Tom Homan to "flood the zone" with immigration agents in sanctuary cities, escalating the Trump administration's ongoing conflict with jurisdictions that have such policies.</p>

The court blocked a lower appellate court ruling from the Eighth Circuit in a North Dakota case that would have stripped this right, which is an outlier decision nationally. However, the victory for voting rights advocates may be temporary, as the justices are set to rehear a similar case from Louisiana that could ultimately determine the future of this key enforcement provision.</p>

The independent Member of Parliament, along with co-leader Zarah Sultana, is creating an alternative to what they describe as Labour's "control freaks" and the "dangerously divisive" politics of other parties. The yet-unnamed party will be community-based and aims to capitalize on energy from the left wing of British politics, with an inaugural conference planned for the autumn.</p>
