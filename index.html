          <p>Seven men in Rochdale have been convicted of multiple counts of sexual offenses against two teenage girls, known as Girl A and Girl B, over a five-year period. The girls were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves," with the men, including market stallholders and taxi drivers, plying them with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. One victim believed she was preyed upon by hundreds of men, while another claimed authorities were aware but unconcerned. Detective Superintendent Alan Clitherow acknowledged the police should have done more at the time and apologized for their failings, highlighting the need for children to speak out and for adults to recognize grooming signs. The treatment of the victims at the hands of these predators was nothing short of appalling.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling U.S. elections, siding with Democratic state attorneys general who argued it was an unconstitutional overreach. The executive order, issued on March 25, sought to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The attorneys general contended that the directive usurped the states' constitutional power and attempted to amend election law through executive action. The White House defended the order as a measure to ensure free, fair, and honest elections, calling proof of citizenship a "commonsense" requirement.</p>

The U.S. stated it was not involved in Israel's strikes but warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests, as President Trump urged Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called for de-escalation, emphasizing that a nuclear conflict was not imminent, though the exchange of attacks has cast doubt on the future of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the reasons behind the tech industry's shift towards the right and its subsequent disappointment with the Trump administration. It attributes this shift to factors such as the "Great Awokening," a changing macroeconomic environment, and deliberate efforts by liberals to target the tech scene. Despite initial hopes for deregulation, tax cuts, and anti-woke policies, the tech right has largely been unsuccessful in achieving its goals under Trump. The author suggests that the Democrats should consider which voters can be won back as Trump's coalition fractures. The rise of the tech right is a notable development in the political landscape.</p>

Trump expressed frustration that these judges did not support his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, leading to a rift with the conservative legal movement. The author explains that the Federalist Society prioritizes originalist legal philosophy over loyalty to Trump, which has baffled the president. This divide is expected to influence Trump's future judicial appointments, potentially leading to the selection of more overtly MAGA-aligned candidates.

          <p>An appeals court has temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that would have directed the Trump administration to return control of California's National Guard troops to the state. The initial order came after a judge ruled that Trump's deployment of the troops to Los Angeles to quell immigration raids was illegal. California Governor Gavin Newsom and other local officials had rejected the move as an unnecessary provocation. The Trump administration argued that it took over California's National Guard to restore order and protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, while California contended that the protests did not rise to the level of a rebellion.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1 across the UK. Lawyers representing families and private schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law, particularly for families with children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send), those attending same-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools. The government argued the policy would raise £1.8bn a year to support pupils in state schools. The court found that while the legislation interferes with some human rights, the government was entitled to consider the expected revenue raised for public services.</p>

While such a move could disrupt global oil flows, analysts believe it is unlikely due to the potential for further retaliation and backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Blocking the strait could harm Iran's own interests, as most of its daily consumption goods come via that route. The presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain also makes a full-scale blockade difficult.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun sending termination notices to approximately 500,000 foreign nationals who had received temporary stays under the CHNV program, which was open to applicants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Recipients are encouraged to "self-deport immediately" and will receive travel assistance and a $1,000 bonus upon arrival in their home country if they comply using the DHS's Home Mobile App. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing DHS to order CHNV participants to leave the country, even as they challenge Trump's revocation of the program. The action has sparked controversy and concerns over the fate of these immigrants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to planned "No Kings" protests by asserting he doesn't "feel like a king," citing challenges in getting his policies approved. The protests, scheduled in 50 states and 1,500 cities, are intended to counter the expensive military parade planned for his birthday and the U.S. Army’s anniversary. The protests coincide with uproar over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has led to the deployment of the National Guard and Marines in California. Trump warned protesters they would be met with "very big force."</p>
