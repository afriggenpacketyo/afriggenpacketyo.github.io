          <p>Donald Trump's erratic trade policies are causing uncertainty for businesses worldwide, with frequent reversals on issues ranging from tariffs on strollers and movies to broader trade deals. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, noted the widespread uncertainty among businesses and market participants. Recent examples include fluctuating stances on tariff exemptions for childcare products, potential tariffs on foreign-produced movies, and the on-again, off-again nature of trade deals, including a recent accord with the UK. Bessent has been dispatched to Geneva to negotiate with Chinese officials, and Trump stressed the treasury secretary was leading these talks.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is requesting an apology from the Football Association after being banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan raised concerns about fairness and safety with the referee, leading to a six-match ban that sparked protests. An FA appeal board later deemed the initial hearing unfair, quashing the ruling; the case was dropped when the complainant withdrew. Vaughan says the incident has significantly impacted her life, causing stress and disruption, and believes the FA put her through unnecessary turmoil.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google after it changed the label for the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order. President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit after previously threatening legal action, arguing that the name change affects Mexico's continental shelf. Google's policy is to follow local official names, but in the U.S., it uses 'Gulf of America.' The Mexican president shared a response from Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy, Cris Turner, who said the company would not change its policy after Trump's order.</p>

In the ninth, a series of hits brought the Dodgers within one run before Ohtani's decisive homer. The Diamondbacks' decision to pitch to Ohtani instead of intentionally walking him proved costly, as he capitalized with a towering shot.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for crucial trade negotiations aimed at resolving the ongoing trade war. The talks follow President Trump's tariff increases on Chinese imports and China's retaliatory levies on U.S. goods, which have disrupted global trade. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that discussions are taking place has raised hopes for de-escalation. The negotiations are being closely watched by economists and investors concerned about the economic impact of the trade war.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supply chains, aiming to counter foreign pressure through economic dominance. This strategy involves increasing exports, investing heavily in manufacturing, and implementing economic warfare tactics. However, this approach has strained relationships with trading partners and imposed costs on Chinese households. While China's control over key industries has strengthened its position, it also faces challenges in balancing economic growth with political control, potentially limiting the influence of its businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is facing scrutiny over proposed job cuts as part of the Trump administration's DOGE initiative, with concerns raised about the potential impact on veteran healthcare. Despite assurances from VA Secretary Doug Collins that frontline healthcare will be protected, critics argue that achieving the stated workforce reduction goals without affecting care is unrealistic.

          <p>The British steel industry is experiencing a sense of relief following President Trump's decision to lift 25 percent tariffs on steel exported to the United States. The tariffs had posed a significant threat to the struggling industry, which faces challenges such as weak demand, foreign competition, and high energy costs. The agreement is expected to boost demand for British steel in the U.S. market.

The ruling comes as part of a lawsuit brought by federal employee unions, arguing that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. The judge stated that President Trump likely needs congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks.

High tariffs on shipments between the world’s two largest economies continue to stifle bilateral trade, leaving Chinese manufacturers with unsold goods.
