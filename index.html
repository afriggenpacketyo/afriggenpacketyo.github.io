          <p>Ukrainians living in or having escaped from Russian-occupied Mariupol describe a starkly different reality than the one portrayed on Russian television. They report that while central streets are repaired for propaganda cameras, much of the city remains in ruins, with severe water shortages, power cuts, and scarce, expensive medicine. Residents also detail the imposition of a Russian curriculum in schools, which teaches a propagandized version of history and geography. Despite the risks, a local resistance movement continues to operate, providing intelligence to the Ukrainian military and symbolizing hope for liberation.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant bipartisan backlash from senators and House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal due to an inability to guarantee the land would not be sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation advocates celebrated the decision as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize federal lands.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek re-election, stating that independent, bipartisan thinkers have become an "endangered species" in Washington. His decision came a day after he voted against advancing President Trump's signature budget bill, citing devastating cuts to Medicaid that would harm his state. In response, Trump sharply criticized Tillis and threatened to support a primary challenger against him. Tillis's retirement from the swing-state seat could create an opening for Democrats in the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the Republican budget bill currently in the Senate could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose their health insurance. The analysis also projects the legislation would add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. These figures are complicating Republican efforts to pass the bill, which relies on over $1 trillion in healthcare funding cuts, primarily from Medicaid, to offset tax cuts and other spending. The potential impacts have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and concern from some moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently debating President Trump's major legislative priority, a massive bill combining tax cuts with spending changes. After narrowly advancing the bill in a procedural vote, the chamber has entered a lengthy debate period, with Democrats expected to use their allotted time to criticize the legislation. Republicans are utilizing the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority for passage, to bypass potential Democratic filibusters. Following the debate, senators anticipate a "vote-a-rama," an overnight session of unlimited amendment votes, before a final vote on the bill.</p>

The incident has drawn condemnation from the Israeli embassy and British politicians, who criticized the "incendiary and hateful rhetoric." The BBC, which broadcast the performance live, said it issued an on-screen warning about strong and discriminatory language. The controversy occurred alongside another politically charged performance by the Irish-language rap group Kneecap, whose member faces terrorism-related accusations.</p>

          <p>This article provides an analytical perspective on the challenges of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) in the context of the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. It argues that early reports, like a leaked DIA memo suggesting minimal damage, are often premature and incomplete, as a full assessment requires integrating various intelligence sources over time. The author suggests that given the sophisticated munitions, delivery platforms, and extensive intelligence on the targets, the damage was likely severe. The analysis emphasizes considering the cumulative and functional effects on Iran's entire nuclear ecosystem, not just physical destruction.</p>

          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul secured a unanimous decision win against former middleweight world champion Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. Paul controlled the early rounds of the fight, building a lead on the scorecards while ChÃ¡vez started slowly and seemed disconnected. Although ChÃ¡vez showed more life in the later rounds, his effort was insufficient to overcome Paul's early dominance. The victory is a significant step for Paul in his quest to be seen as a legitimate boxer, as it marks a win over an established, albeit faded, former champion.</p>
