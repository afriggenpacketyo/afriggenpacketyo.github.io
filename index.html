            <p>The article highlights the impact of the Trump Administration's suspension of global health programs on HIV patients in Zambia, detailing the chaos and confusion as clinics close and medications become scarce. Personal stories of a 10-year-old girl, a house painter, and a teenager reveal the struggles faced by individuals who have lost access to life-saving HIV treatment. The closure of U.S.-funded clinics has forced patients to seek help from overwhelmed government facilities, leading to rationing and increased illness.

            <p>The article analyzes the potential outcomes of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, suggesting that current U.S. strategies may strengthen China's geopolitical position and weaken the U.S. economy. It argues that the U.S.'s dependence on Chinese goods is a weakness, while China has prepared for economic conflict by diversifying its markets and reducing reliance on American imports. The article suggests that the U.S. could still win by collaborating with allies, but the current administration's approach is counterproductive. A Chinese victory could embolden Beijing in non-economic matters, making future conflicts more likely.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the protectionist policies of the Great Depression era amid escalating trade tensions. Drawing on ancient Chinese philosophy, Xie emphasized addressing the root causes of economic issues rather than focusing on symptoms. He specifically cited the Smoot-Hawley Act as a cautionary tale, highlighting how high tariffs led to a dramatic fall in global trade and exacerbated the economic crisis. The ambassador urged for joint efforts to grow the global economy instead of engaging in trade disputes.</p>

            <p>A new report indicates that abortion providers in the U.S. performed over 1 million abortions in 2024, with approximately 155,000 people crossing state lines to access the procedure. The report highlights a geographic divide, with states like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico becoming major hubs for abortion access. Simultaneously, the Trump administration has effectively dismantled the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports, raising concerns about the ability to track public health outcomes and assess the impact of abortion policies.

            <p>The article argues that the Labour Party in the UK should focus on the risks to global financial stability posed by Trump's policies, not just the impact on trade. While the government negotiates tariffs, Labour's stance on the financial sector appears relaxed, despite warnings from the Bank of England about deregulating the City. The author suggests Labour needs to address the potential for a financial crisis stemming from Trump's policies and the growth of unregulated, non-bank lending. The article calls for a more proactive approach to regulating shadow banking and protecting the UK economy from global financial shocks.</p>

            <p>Joking about Trump’s frenetic rollout of tariffs has become a common response to the altogether serious issue of an economic fight started by the president that has upended markets, led to boycotts of American-made goods and travel to the U.S., and sparked fears of a recession. Some of the humor has a barbed, geopolitical aim in a war for the world’s hearts and minds — see the Chinese government’s fusillade of memes — but political scientists say that, for many people, humor is a natural response to stressful times.</p>
