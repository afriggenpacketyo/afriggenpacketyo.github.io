          <p>President Trump announced he is considering revoking the US citizenship of comedian Rosie O'Donnell, a long-time vocal critic, whom he labeled a "threat to humanity." Posting on his social media platform, Trump suggested O'Donnell should remain in Ireland, where she currently resides. Legal experts note there is no precedent or legal basis for a president to revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born citizen under current law. This follows other instances where Trump has questioned the citizenship of political opponents, escalating his use of executive power threats against his critics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years, defeating Rinky Hijikata and David Pel. Their victory marks a significant moment in British tennis history, being the first time two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam since 1936. Following the win, Glasspool's uniquely muted celebration, a stark contrast to his partner's jubilation, drew attention, a habit he explained stemmed from a playful opposition to a former partner's exuberant reactions. The pair achieved a major career goal with this maiden Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, Florida, was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank while visiting family. According to his relatives and the Palestinian Health Ministry, the attack occurred as he was protecting his family's land, and settlers allegedly blocked paramedics from reaching him for hours. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death and is providing consular assistance, while Musallet's family is demanding a U.S.-led investigation into the killing. The incident highlights ongoing violent confrontations and tensions in the region between settlers and Palestinian residents.</p>

          <p>The final day of the BST Hyde Park music festival has been canceled after headliner Jeff Lynne's ELO pulled out at the last minute due to the frontman's health. Lynne, 77, was advised by doctors not to perform following a "systemic infection," a similar reason for a recent cancellation in Manchester. The band stated Lynne was "heartbroken" and that the performance, which he had previously hinted could be ELO's last, could not be rescheduled. Ticketholders for the event will receive full refunds from their point of purchase.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek has won her first Wimbledon title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a commanding 6-0, 6-0 victory that lasted just 57 minutes. This "double bagel" win is the most one-sided women's final at the All England Club since 1911, securing Świątek's sixth Grand Slam title overall. The victory is particularly significant as it demonstrates her mastery on grass, previously considered her weakest surface, making her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova, in her first major final after returning from a mental health break, struggled with nerves and fatigue.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its bombing campaign against Ukraine, launching hundreds of drones and cruise missiles in overnight attacks that killed at least six people and wounded dozens more. The strikes targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi and Lviv in the west, as well as the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down a majority of the incoming missiles and drones. These long-range attacks coincide with a concerted Russian effort to advance along the front line, where Ukrainian forces are under severe pressure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has begun laying off more than 1,300 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration to reduce its domestic workforce by about 15%. The cuts, which include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, have targeted numerous offices, including those focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the layoffs will severely undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts and national security. The administration contends the changes are necessary to eliminate redundancy and streamline the department's focus.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons trafficking charges. Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that plunged the country into a wave of gang violence. During a virtual court hearing, he accepted the extradition, a process which will now move forward for final approval. This marks a major step in Ecuador's crackdown on organized crime under President Daniel Noboa.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Trump. According to sources, the dismissals have targeted individuals identified by the Justice Department's "weaponization working group," including some who served in support roles. This move follows previous purges and reassignments within the DOJ and has reportedly sent a chill through the department's career workforce. The firings are seen as a significant escalation in the administration's reshaping of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has identified the U.S. state economies that are strongest and most prepared to handle a potential recession, with Florida, Texas, and North Carolina taking the top three spots. The study considered metrics like GDP and job growth, as well as state fiscal health and exposure to risks like federal budget cuts and international trade tariffs. Florida ranked number one for the third consecutive year, credited with strong growth and relative insulation from a trade war with China. The report highlights how states are marketing their economic stability to attract business investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariff costs and trade uncertainty, businesses are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce taxes on imported goods. FTZs allow companies to import components duty-free, assemble them, and only pay duties when the final product enters U.S. commerce. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product. This has increased costs for some manufacturers and driven demand for bonded warehouses. (not investment advice)</p>
