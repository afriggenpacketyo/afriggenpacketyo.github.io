          <p>International aid organizations are condemning the use of airdrops to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, labeling the efforts as "futile" and "cynical." Groups like Doctors Without Borders argue that airdrops are notoriously inefficient, expensive, and dangerous, often failing to reach the most vulnerable populations. They insist that unhindered land access for aid convoys is the only viable solution to address the catastrophic famine, which UN experts say is currently unfolding and has already led to numerous deaths from starvation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields climbed after the Federal Reserve announced it would not cut interest rates at its latest meeting. The market's reaction was also bolstered by a government report showing that the U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% annualized rate in the second quarter. The 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for borrowing costs, rose in response to the central bank's steady stance and the robust economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump for aggressive cuts. The decision was notably divisive, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, marking the most significant internal opposition since 1993. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that while the economy has moderated, the committee made no advance decisions about future meetings and will continue to monitor incoming data.

          <p>This article discusses an NPR segment analyzing the shifting dynamics between NASA and SpaceX, led by Elon Musk. Journalist Franklin Foer explains how Musk's ambitious goals, especially the colonization of Mars, coupled with the Trump administration's policies, are fundamentally reshaping the space agency. The piece raises critical questions about whether the private ambitions of SpaceX could potentially overshadow or divert NASA from its long-standing public mission of scientific discovery.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged corporate America and U.S. trade partners "not to panic" as the August 1 deadline for reaching new trade deals approaches. Bessent framed the deadline as a negotiating tool, stating that countries could still finalize agreements even after higher tariff rates potentially take effect. He predicted a "busy August" for trade negotiations, acknowledging that many countries have not yet concluded deals with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal program allowing public servants to "buy back" credit toward student loan forgiveness has been crippled by a massive backlog, with over 65,000 applications pending. This delay is preventing thousands of eligible government and non-profit employees from receiving their promised debt cancellation under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Critics attribute the bottleneck to significant staff reductions at the Department of Education, leaving borrowers in financial limbo.</p>
