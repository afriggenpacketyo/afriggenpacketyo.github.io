          <h2>Congressional Bid to Advance Crypto Regulation Bills Fails</h2>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives failed to clear a crucial procedural hurdle, effectively blocking several crypto-related bills from a vote, a significant blow to the cryptocurrency industry's "Crypto Week" legislative hopes. Despite President Trump's strong public endorsement and call for a "yes" vote on measures like the "GENIUS Act" to establish U.S. leadership in digital assets, the motion failed 196-223. Notably, 13 Republicans voted against the President's direction, highlighting a rare instance of intra-party dissent. This outcome delays potential regulatory clarity and innovation in the digital asset sector, leaving the industry in a state of legislative uncertainty for the foreseeable future.

          <p>Two people tragically died in Plainfield, New Jersey, when their car was swept into Cedar Brook during severe flash floods, raising the local death toll to four within days. The intense rainfall caused widespread chaos, submerging cars, flooding roadways, and leading to numerous flight cancellations across the Mid-Atlantic, including New York City and Washington D.C. In North Plainfield, police rescued approximately 40 individuals from homes and cars inundated by chest-high water. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency, as the region braces for continued flood threats and works to strengthen emergency response systems against future tragedies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to release "whatever she thinks is credible" regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files, responding to mounting pressure for transparency from his MAGA base. This statement follows a Justice Department and FBI review that found no "client list" and confirmed Epstein's suicide, findings Trump baselessly attributed to political foes. The issue has fueled outrage among his supporters and caused internal friction within his administration, with Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino reportedly confronting Bondi. Trump's directive aims to quell the revolt and refocus his administration on other priorities, emphasizing the importance of credible evidence.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are pushing to pass legislation that would slash $9.4 billion from foreign aid programs and public broadcasting, aligning with President Trump’s broader campaign for dramatic government spending cuts. The proposed rescissions include $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion from foreign assistance, impacting vital global immunization and HIV prevention efforts. While proponents argue it targets "waste, fraud and abuse," Democrats warn this package is merely the initial step towards deeper cuts in critical social services. The bill faces internal Republican dissent, particularly from moderates concerned about its impact on essential programs and rural communities.</p>

Experts hail the mosaic as a work of "extraordinary cultural interest," potentially adorning a bedroom floor, marking a pivotal moment where domestic love became an artistic subject.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in June rose to an annual rate of 2.7%, marking its highest level since February and indicating an uptick in inflation after earlier declines this year. Month-over-month, the CPI increased by 0.3%, driven significantly by rising food and energy prices. Notably, early signs suggest that President Trump's recently announced tariffs on goods from over 20 countries, scheduled to take effect on August 1, are beginning to exert upward pricing pressure on certain categories like apparel and home furnishings. This latest inflation data makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this month highly improbable, signaling potential continued economic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is slated to announce a $70 billion investment plan in AI and energy for Pennsylvania at a summit in Pittsburgh, a move that has drawn strong criticism from environmental and community organizations. The event, hosted at Carnegie Mellon University, aims to promote the state as an AI leader by emphasizing its fossil fuel reserves as a power source. Critics argue that this investment, particularly after recent rollbacks of green energy tax credits, will exacerbate climate change and negatively impact local health. The summit highlights a contentious alliance between the oil industry and tech giants, raising concerns about environmental and social consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

The electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft maker is doubling capacity at its Marina, California, manufacturing hub and opening a newly remodeled components facility in Dayton, Ohio, which will create hundreds of new full-time jobs. Engineers from Toyota will assist in scaling production to 500 aircraft annually at the Ohio plant. This expansion, coupled with recent government support for air taxi testing, signals strong momentum for Joby as it pursues Federal Aviation Administration approval for commercial operations.
