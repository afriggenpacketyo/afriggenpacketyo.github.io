          <p>British athlete Georgia Hunter Bell is set to compete against her training partner, Keely Hodgkinson, in the 800m final at the World Championships in Tokyo. After a successful season and leaving her cybersecurity career to become a full-time athlete, Hunter Bell chose to focus on the 800m over the 1500m, a decision influenced by advice from Dame Kelly Holmes. The two friends and rivals share a coach and hope to secure a one-two finish for Great Britain, viewing the opportunity as a collective team achievement rather than a negative personal rivalry.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack has disrupted a check-in and baggage system used by numerous airlines, causing extensive delays at major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Dublin. The attack targeted the 'Muse' software from Collins Aerospace, forcing airport staff to resort to manual, paper-based check-ins and leading to hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. While the software provider, RTX, is working to resolve the issue, there is currently no timeline for restoration, and authorities like the UK's National Cyber Security Centre are investigating the incident's full impact.</p>

Goldman Sachs has expressed a more positive outlook on Germany's economy, citing a "window of opportunity" for growth under the current government. In London, Canary Wharf is experiencing a revival, with office leasing expected to hit a decade high as major financial firms return. While private equity markets face some headwinds with reduced capital inflows, the overall sentiment from upcoming conferences in Munich and Paris points toward a potential European economic comeback.

          <p>The USC Trojans football team improved to a 4-0 record after defeating Michigan State 45-31, despite facing challenges with penalties and defensive lapses. Wide receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, accounting for 127 receiving yards and two touchdowns, stepping up in the absence of injured teammate Ja’Kobi Lane. Although USC's offense generated over 500 yards, the team's lack of discipline, resulting in 10 penalties, allowed Michigan State to remain competitive until a crucial fourth-quarter scoring drive sealed the victory for the Trojans.</p>

The Taliban stated the couple was released after judicial proceedings for breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons for their detention were never disclosed.</p>

          <p>The killing of Charlie Kirk has ignited a fierce debate over political rhetoric and media responsibility, highlighted by ABC's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host's comments about the assassination. This decision has drawn criticism from figures like former VP Kamala Harris for stifling free speech, while others, including Elon Musk, have pointed to her past calls to suspend Donald Trump's social media. Commentators like Bill Maher have also criticized Hollywood for its perceived silence on the assassination, reflecting deep divisions on how to address political violence and the role of inflammatory language in public discourse.</p>

This shift is a strategic response to the prevalence of effective, high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. By utilizing the long passing abilities of goalkeepers like David Raya and targeting physically dominant forwards like Kai Havertz and Erling Haaland, both teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create unpredictable attacking opportunities.</p>

          <p>As more Western nations move to recognize a Palestinian state, analysis suggests the immediate impact may be more symbolic than practical in ending the Gaza war. While recognition alone cannot force a ceasefire, it provides Palestinians with a stronger diplomatic standing in future negotiations, elevating their status from an entity to a state. Supporters argue this move is an important reaffirmation of Palestinian rights and could lead to a review of legal and diplomatic ties with both Palestine and Israel. However, critics worry it could be seen as "political theater" without tangible actions like sanctions or boycotts to pressure Israel.</p>
