          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the film "Rust" against the movie's producers, including Alec Baldwin. The lawsuit alleged negligence leading to the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. The plaintiffs sought compensation for the emotional distress they experienced as witnesses to the tragedy. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. This development follows the separate involuntary manslaughter conviction of the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, and a dismissed charge against Baldwin.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man has pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after kicking a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the dog, a 5-year-old named Freddie, alerted its handler to the man's suitcase during a baggage inspection. The man was found to be illegally importing over 100 pounds of prohibited agricultural products. He was ordered to pay the dog's veterinary bills for its injuries and has been removed back to Egypt.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 70 authors, including prominent names like Lauren Groff and Dennis Lehane, has published an open letter demanding that major publishing houses commit to curtailing the use of artificial intelligence. The letter asks publishers to pledge not to release AI-generated books, replace human employees with AI tools, or use AI for audiobook narration. This initiative shifts the focus from suing AI companies for copyright infringement to holding publishers accountable for protecting human creativity.

The measure, which invoked the 1973 War Powers Resolution, was defeated in a 53-47 vote. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities did not cause a major radioactive release, though several sites were severely damaged.

The article reflects on the subsequent challenges for the party, including Trump's victory and internal divisions, such as the recent split over Zohran Mamdani's primary win in New York City. The author argues that Democrats remain in a state of disarray, relitigating the past instead of looking toward the future and anointing a new generation of leaders for 2028.</p>

Researchers expressed shock at the abrupt decision, stating there is no adequate replacement and that the loss of data will leave them "blind" during what is expected to be an active hurricane season.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying threats of legal consequences from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with attendees risking fines and organizers facing potential prison sentences. The march was attended by numerous European Union officials and MEPs, who expressed solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community and civil society. Participants voiced their desire for a country that respects diversity and fundamental human rights for all its citizens.</p>

          <p>Representative Don Bacon, a Republican from a competitive Nebraska swing district, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026. This decision makes his Omaha-area seat a prime target for Democrats aiming to regain a majority in the House of Representatives. Bacon, known for his occasional criticism of Donald Trump and for representing a district that voted for Kamala Harris, confirmed his plans following initial reports. His retirement removes the advantage of incumbency for the GOP in a district that is increasingly vital for national-level political control.</p>

While some, like Donald Trump, have labeled him an extremist, others at a recent conservative conference expressed a grudging respect for his effective grassroots campaign against establishment candidate Andrew Cuomo. Many conservatives view his rise as a phenomenon specific to liberal New York and not indicative of a broader national trend.

          <p>According to Middle East expert Pan Guang, China is likely to remain cautious in its response to Iran's requests for support amidst escalating conflicts with the U.S. and Israel. While Iran may seek Chinese weaponry, Beijing is expected to prioritize its broader interests, which include balancing relationships with Israel and other Western-aligned nations in the region. Pan suggests that the direct Iran-Israel conflict is unlikely to spiral into a wider war, but retaliatory actions could continue.

          <p>A real estate broker with a decade of experience recommends using the "80-10-10 Rule" to help homebuyers determine if a property is the right fit. According to this guideline, an ideal house should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, like location or architectural style. Another 10% should consist of things you can improve over time, such as paint or fixtures. The final 10% are aspects you can learn to live with, like a neighbor's fence. This framework helps buyers move beyond a long list of wants and focus on what is truly essential.</p>

The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention treaty, would require exporting countries to provide proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel. If adopted, these regulations would take effect in June 2027 and aim to protect endangered eel populations from over-exploitation. The move sets up a significant debate between conservation efforts and the economic interests of countries with large eel fishing industries.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Guidance on When Paying for a Laundry Service Is a Worthwhile Expense</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planners suggest a framework for deciding whether outsourcing laundry is a smart financial move. Key considerations include comparing the service cost to your personal hourly rate; if the service costs less, it can be a good use of money. It is also important to evaluate the emotional benefit, as offloading a dreaded chore can reduce burnout and improve well-being. Experts advise ensuring that such convenience expenses do not compromise long-term financial goals like retirement savings. Ultimately, the decision depends on a balance of time, money, and personal happiness.</p>
