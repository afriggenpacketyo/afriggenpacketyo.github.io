          <p>Attorneys for Erik and Lyle Menendez argue that the current District Attorney's opposition to their resentencing is politically motivated, not legally sound.  They claim that the District Attorney's actions ignore the facts of the case and disregard the brothers' expressions of remorse.  The case involves allegations of years of abuse by their parents, which the defense claims is relevant to the resentencing decision.  The brothers are pursuing multiple avenues for release, including resentencing, a new trial, and clemency.</p>

          <p>President Trump's planned tariffs, set for April 2nd, are causing concern in the EU and UK, anticipating a potential trade war.  A blanket tariff of 20% on imports is expected, but sectoral tariffs remain a possibility.  The UK is seeking a trade deal to mitigate the impact, despite Trump's broad approach.  The EU is considering a strong response, including potential tariffs on US tech companies, but prefers negotiation before retaliation. <i>(not investment advice)<br></i></p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block a bipartisan proposal for proxy voting for new parents failed, with nine Republicans joining Democrats in opposition.  The proposal, supported by a majority of House members, would allow new parents to designate a proxy to vote for 12 weeks.  Johnson argued against proxy voting as unconstitutional and a violation of tradition, while supporters emphasized the need for modernizing Congress to accommodate the needs of parents.  The outcome highlights the ongoing tension between tradition and modernizing congressional practices.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency successfully decommissioned its Gaia spacecraft after more than a decade of mapping billions of stars.  The spacecraft's resilience and redundant systems made decommissioning challenging, requiring a complex strategy to prevent reactivation.  Gaia's mission yielded a vast catalog of data crucial for astronomical research.  The spacecraft has now been moved to a stable orbit around the sun, ensuring it will remain far from Earth for at least the next century.</p>
