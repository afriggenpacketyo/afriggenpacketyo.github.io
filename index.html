          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly committed to remaining at the helm of the electric vehicle company for the next five years, addressing concerns from investors about his dedication given his advisory role in President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Musk emphasized that his desire to maintain control over Tesla's future is the primary reason for staying on, rather than financial gain. He seeks to retain sufficient voting power to prevent being ousted by activist investors, ensuring he can guide the company's direction and long-term strategy. Musk's announcement led to a slight increase in Tesla's stock price.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker has been apprehended and charged with aiding ten inmates in their escape from a New Orleans jail, according to the Louisiana attorney general's office. The escape occurred late last week, with the inmates breaching a cell door and a wall before fleeing through a loading dock and over a fence. The escape went unnoticed for several hours due to the absence of a deputy in the area and a civilian monitor's break, prompting an investigation into the security lapse. Authorities have captured four of the escaped inmates, while the search continues for the remaining six.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that market volatility has resurfaced as President Trump's trade war persists and congressional Republicans negotiate a significant spending bill, potentially adding $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Foreign investors are seemingly avoiding U.S. assets, contributing to a 'sell America' trend, while concerns about the federal deficit's unsustainability are growing among CEOs and economists. Home Depot reported disappointing sales but intends to maintain current pricing levels, while Regeneron is set to acquire 23andMe out of bankruptcy, adhering to privacy policies. Senators have passed a crypto regulation bill amid debates about its potential to benefit the Trump family, while SPACs are making a comeback with ties to the president.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that the death of an 11-year-old girl who drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire was an unlawful killing, citing gross breaches in health and safety. Kyra Hill got into difficulty in a designated swimming area in August 2022, and was found more than an hour after emergency services were alerted. The inquest revealed a lack of an emergency plan, risk assessment, and adequate warning signs, with the park owner previously fined Â£80,000. The lifeguard spotted Kyra struggling and alerted colleagues, but emergency services were not called for 37 minutes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As senior homeowners face financial pressures, experts are advising them to consider options like HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) and reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity. HELOCs offer flexible financing with lower interest rates compared to credit cards, making them suitable for short-term needs like home improvements or debt consolidation. Reverse mortgages, available to seniors 62 and up, allow homeowners to convert equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income. However, reverse mortgages accrue interest and fees, reducing home equity over time, and are best suited as long-term solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which anticipates raising prices due to tariffs, and comes as Home Depot experiences stagnating sales in a sluggish housing market.

Claims that Biden has 'stage five' metastatic cancer are false, as there is no such classification in the TNM staging system, and questions about whether his medical condition was covered up are unproven. While a White House health summary in February 2024 did not mention the nodule found during a recent exam, it did acknowledge previous diagnoses and treatments for skin cancer. The Biden administration has denied allegations of concealing his health status.</p>

          <p>A House Judiciary Committee hearing on threats against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations is expected to ignite partisan clashes. Tensions remain high following an incident at Delaney Hall Detention Center in New Jersey, where Democratic lawmakers protested Trump's immigration policies. Republican representatives accuse Democrats of obstructing the president's efforts to deport criminals, while Democrats defend their actions and criticize the administration's handling of immigration. The hearing aims to examine the impact of sanctuary policies and anti-enforcement rhetoric on public safety, with both sides preparing to defend their positions.</p>
