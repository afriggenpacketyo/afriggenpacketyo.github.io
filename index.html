            <p>Oscar Piastri emerged victorious at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a penalty. Piastri started strong, overtaking Verstappen at the first corner, leading to Verstappen cutting the chicane and incurring a penalty. Piastri managed his lead effectively throughout the race, holding off Verstappen and George Russell. Leclerc secured a podium finish with a strategic late pit stop, while Norris drove a strong race to finish fourth after starting on hard tires. The race featured a safety car incident early on, but no further interruptions, with Andrea Kimi Antonelli finishing sixth and Lewis Hamilton struggling in seventh. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF claimed its troops believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces, but the inquiry found failings including poor night visibility and misidentification of the vehicles as ambulances. A deputy commander has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report. The IDF stated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but did not provide evidence, while a video found on a medic's phone showed the ambulances with lights on, contradicting initial claims.</p>

            <p>Following Man Utd's 0-1 defeat to Wolves, manager Ruben Amorim voiced his concern over the team's inability to score goals, particularly highlighting the struggles of striker Rasmus Hojlund. Despite Hojlund's efforts, he has been largely unconvincing, lacking the impact of other top Premier League players. Amorim emphasized the team's collective responsibility for the goalscoring issues, noting that several players miss big chances. He also praised the performances of young players like Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass, with the team's season now hinging on their Europa League campaign.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are panic buying in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity in April but lead to a slowdown in the coming months. Sectors like the auto industry are likely to heavily stock up on inventory before import levies potentially rise. Despite short-term uncertainty, Goolsbee remains optimistic about the country's longer-term economic outlook, citing steady employment and declining inflation.</p>

In response, Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" attempted assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells.

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics last month in Gaza found "professional failures" by Israeli forces, leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander. Israel initially claimed the medics' vehicles lacked emergency signals, but later backtracked after cellphone video contradicted this account. The investigation found that the deputy battalion commander assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants due to poor night visibility. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members, though the Civil Defense is part of the Hamas-run government.</p>

While prolonged tariffs could boost the used tech market, some analysts believe consumers will revert to new devices once tariffs subside.
