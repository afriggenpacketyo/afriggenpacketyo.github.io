            <p>China's exports experienced a significant increase of 12.4% in March, driven by sellers accelerating shipments to beat impending US tariffs. This resilience in exports occurred despite a backdrop of escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with President Trump threatening new tariffs on Chinese goods. However, imports into China declined by 4.3% year-on-year, resulting in a substantial trade surplus for the month. The updated figures highlight the ongoing economic complexities and uncertainties arising from the trade war between the two economic giants.</p>

            <p>Ecuador's center-right President Daniel Noboa won re-election, securing a full four-year term after initially winning a snap election in November 2023. Noboa's campaign focused on a tough stance against violent criminal gangs, militarizing the streets and prisons. Despite accusations of fraud from his left-wing challenger, Luisa González, Noboa secured a decisive victory with approximately 56% of the vote. He aims to amend the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador, seeking international assistance in combating drug gangs and has expressed interest in strengthening ties with the United States and President Donald Trump.</p>

            <p>South Africa is set to re-open the inquest into the death of Nobel laureate Albert Luthuli, former leader of the African National Congress (ANC), who died in 1967 after being struck by a train. Doubts have long persisted regarding the official account of his death, with activists and family suspecting foul play by the apartheid regime. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) plans to present new evidence in an attempt to overturn the initial findings, though the specifics of this evidence have not been disclosed. The Luthuli case is one of two high-profile inquests into the deaths of anti-apartheid figures being re-examined.</p>

            <p>Singapore's Monetary Authority (MAS) has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, citing lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. The MAS reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER), while maintaining a modest and gradual appreciation policy. This decision follows a previous easing in January, marking the first loosening of policy since 2020. The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, attributing the slowdown to declines in manufacturing and certain services sectors.</p>

            <p>President Trump has created confusion in the markets by initially exempting smartphones and electronics from tariffs, only to later warn that these exemptions would be short-lived and that new tariffs are coming. The administration plans to launch a national security investigation into the semiconductor sector and the electronics supply chain. This back-and-forth has triggered volatility on Wall Street and criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called the policy "chaos and corruption". China has stated that it will ignore any future tariff raises by Trump, as they are already too high.</p>

            <p>Amid market volatility and concerns about Treasury bond yields, investors are seeking strategies for stable income. A bond ladder, involving investments in a range of Treasury maturities held to maturity, offers potential exposure without worrying about short-term price swings. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) provides this approach, investing in Treasuries from 30-day to 10-year bonds and distributing monthly income. Experts say this strategy can provide peace of mind and immunization from liabilities, but it is not without risk in a world of hyper-inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

A TfL report revealed that some passengers in priority seats are unaware of their purpose or fail to notice those who need them. TfL encourages passengers to offer seats to those who ask, regardless of whether they have a badge, and is working to raise awareness of the scheme.</p>

With the region deeply integrated into the North American auto supply chain, workers express anxiety and fear about job losses and the future of the industry.

Rosing argues that the assumptions about rare earth elements are based on a "mythological misunderstanding" and that there are many places in the world where minerals are easier and cheaper to obtain. He emphasizes that the real issue for the West in reducing its reliance on China is not acquiring more territory but developing facilities for processing raw materials and fostering a competitive market.
