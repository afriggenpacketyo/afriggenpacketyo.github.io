          <h2>Turkey's Citizens Resist Autocracy Amidst Global Silence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 01:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Erdogan's increasingly autocratic rule in Turkey, marked by constitutional changes, judicial control, and media suppression, faces growing resistance from the Turkish people. The recent detention of a likely presidential opponent and his associates signals a concerning shift towards authoritarianism, reminiscent of Russia's trajectory. Despite Turkey's strategic importance, the muted global response, including lukewarm reactions from the US and European leaders, fails to adequately support the pro-democracy movement within Turkey and pressure Erdogan's regime to respect democratic principles. The world's democracies should do more to support the Turkish people and pressure Erdogan.</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Titanic passenger Colonel Archibald Gracie just days before the ship's sinking has been sold at auction for a record-breaking £300,000. The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the day Gracie boarded the Titanic, contains a prophetic statement where he mentions awaiting his journey's end before judging the ship. The anonymous buyer purchased the letter at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire, significantly exceeding the expected price, highlighting the enduring fascination with the Titanic disaster and its victims.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that President Donald Trump's job approval rating has sunk to the lowest level for any president in the past 80 years, driven by widespread disapproval of his policies and significant economic discontent. The majority of voters express concern about the economy, with a large percentage believing his policies will trigger a recession. Negative assessments extend beyond the economy, with concerns raised about his administration's respect for the rule of law and its efforts to expand presidential powers. Despite this, Trump maintains trust over Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems.</p>

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruption as President Trump threatens to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reorder the global trading system. This move could significantly impact the flow of drugs made in the European Union, including blockbuster medications like Ozempic, cancer treatments, and flu vaccines. Pharmaceutical products and chemicals are the bloc’s top export to America, and the move would have serious consequences for American consumers and European manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Australia, once a top choice for international students, is now considering capping their numbers as a way to address the country's unaffordable housing crisis. Politicians argue that limiting international students will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, thus lowering prices. This shift marks a significant change for Australia, which previously viewed education as a major export sector. Critics worry about the economic impact of reducing international student intake and suggest focusing on improving selection criteria instead.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and South Korea have risen due to three large steel structures in a disputed area of the Yellow Sea, with comparisons drawn to China's island-building activities in the South China Sea.

Some Chinese analysts caution that this dispute could impede efforts to improve relations, particularly as Beijing seeks support from its neighbors against U.S. tariffs.
