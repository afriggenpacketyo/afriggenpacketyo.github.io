          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and injuries to over 30 people, including five firefighters. Officials reported that rescue crews faced heavy flames and smoke, pulling numerous residents from windows as they arrived on the scene. While the fire's damage was contained to one wing, significant smoke damage occurred throughout the three-story building. The fire chief described the event as an 'unfathomable tragedy' and emphasized the need for mental health support for first responders and families affected by the incident.</p>

          <p>A new company named Jams, backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, is launching a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Jams aims to attract health-conscious consumers by using no seed oils, artificial ingredients, or high-fructose corn syrup, and by offering more protein than its competitor. The product will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide at a slightly higher price point than Uncrustables. Despite the significant challenge, the founder is betting on the appeal of higher-quality ingredients for athletes and families.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has stated its intention to maintain a 'moderately loose' monetary policy to support the nation's goal of approximately 5% economic growth for the year. A deputy governor of the bank explained that the full effects of previous supportive measures have yet to be realized due to inherent policy lags. The central bank will carefully monitor economic conditions and market performance before implementing any future adjustments. This strategy is designed to stimulate domestic demand, stabilize public expectations, and ensure the achievement of China's annual economic and social development objectives.</p>

          <p>An Air China flight from Shanghai to Milan caused a near-miss incident over Siberia after making an unexplained and unauthorized altitude change, bringing it dangerously close to another aircraft. The two planes came within 300-400 feet of each other, far below the standard 1,000-foot minimum separation. The incident occurred when the Air China Airbus A350 climbed from 34,100 feet to 36,000 feet without clearance from air traffic control. Investigators are considering the possibility that the Air China pilot may have misheard or misunderstood an instruction intended for the other aircraft involved in the near-collision.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the deadly July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended due to a new and significant flood threat from weekend thunderstorms. The Guadalupe River, which previously swelled and caused at least 106 deaths in the county, was again expected to reach a moderate flood stage. Authorities issued urgent warnings for residents and volunteer search parties to evacuate the river corridor, calling it a 'dangerous and life-threatening situation.' The new flooding compounds the tragedy for a region where at least 161 people remain missing from the initial disaster.</p>

In response to accusations of mismanagement and extravagance from officials like OMB Director Russell Vought, the Fed published a new 'Frequently Asked Questions' page on its website. The page clarifies that the project is a necessary modernization of historic buildings, not an 'ostentatious overhaul,' and refutes claims of new VIP dining rooms. The Fed also explains that cost increases are due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos, and notes that the project is self-funded, not paid for by taxpayers.</p>

The 27-year-old, who recently joined Burnley, filed a high-value claim of over £1 million with the High Court. The lawsuit pertains to an unspecified injury from July 2022, during a period when he was sidelined for 195 days in his final season at the club.

The incident led to a police investigation, visa revocations by the U.S., and cancellations by several festivals, prompting a debate about artistic expression versus hate speech. Supporters, including other musicians, argue the backlash is a dangerous 'carnival of distraction' from the events in Gaza and an attempt to de-platform artists speaking out against what they and the UN have termed a genocide.</p>

          <p>In this op-ed, former NYC Rent Guidelines Board member Leah Goodridge argues that proposals for a rent freeze, like those from mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, are not unrealistic but are vital lifelines for many New Yorkers. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she asserts that a rent freeze is a proven tool, having been implemented four times in the last decade to address affordability crises. Goodridge contends that criticism of rent freezes is part of a broader agenda by landlord interests to deregulate and ultimately dismantle the rent stabilization system, which protects over a million households from excessive rent hikes and unjust evictions.</p>

          <p>A military dog named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero in Colombia for saving the lives of dozens of soldiers and civilians. While on a reconnaissance mission, Sanson detected a bomb planted by ELN guerrilla fighters, which detonated and severely injured him. Despite losing one of his legs in the blast, his detection prevented a larger tragedy on a commonly used path in the Antioquia region. The army reported that Sanson is now recovering after surgery and will be retired from service. The incident highlights the ongoing dangers faced by military personnel and the critical role of service animals in conflict zones.</p>

          <p>European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to formulate a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of a potential 30% tariff on EU goods, set to begin August 1. While some leaders advocate for preparing strong, proportionate countermeasures, the prevailing sentiment is to continue negotiations to avoid a trade war. The EU has suspended its own retaliatory tariffs as a sign of goodwill, hoping to secure a deal before the deadline. The uncertainty has destabilized transatlantic trade relations, prompting the EU to intensify efforts to open new markets with other global partners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered thousands of instances of abuse involving the use of restraints in federal prisons. The investigation found that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) violated its own policies by shackling inmates for prolonged periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a form of punishment. The report details disturbing cases, including one inmate who died after being restrained for over two days and another who required an amputation. In response, the BOP has agreed to revise its policies and practices to prevent such abuses and ensure more humane treatment.</p>

          <p>A violent series of events in Lexington, Kentucky, left two women dead at a local church after the suspect had earlier shot and injured a state trooper near the city's airport. The gunman fled the initial scene, carjacked a vehicle, and drove to the Richmond Road Baptist Church, where he opened fire, killing a mother and daughter and injuring their husbands. Responding officers shot and killed the suspect at the church. Authorities believe the suspect had a personal connection to individuals at the church and was looking for the mother of his children before the attack unfolded.</p>

The home housed unmarried pregnant women, and records show up to 796 children died there.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, has centered his campaign on affordability, with his proposal for universal free childcare resonating strongly with families. The plan, funded by taxes on corporations and the wealthy, responds to a crisis where average childcare costs exceed $26,000 annually. Activists and parents, burdened by the immense cost, see the policy as a winning issue that addresses financial strain and gender inequality. While facing political hurdles, the proposal builds on the success of the city's universal pre-K program, signaling a growing demand for childcare to be treated as a public good.</p>

          <p>The recent deadly flash flood in Texas's Hill Country bears haunting similarities to a 1987 disaster in the same area, prompting questions about whether lessons were learned. In 1987, a flood on the Guadalupe River killed 10 children from a church camp. Despite that tragedy highlighting the region's vulnerability, a comprehensive early warning system for Kerr County was never implemented. While a neighboring town that installed a siren system successfully evacuated all residents during the recent flood, Kerr County's plans stalled over costs and politics, a failure that now seems tragic in the wake of nearly 130 deaths.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, an Israeli theater director and pacifist describes the profound sense of alienation he experiences for opposing the war in Gaza. He feels rejected both at home, where his anti-war stance is seen as a betrayal by relatives, and abroad, where his Israeli identity leads to his being labeled a 'killer' by international colleagues. The author recounts painful encounters that highlight the collapse of nuance, where he is seen as either a traitor or a colonizer, with no space for a complex identity. He argues for the necessity of an uncomfortable middle ground where dissent and complexity can exist to imagine a future beyond perpetual conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite modern advancements like comfortable beds and climate control that should enable better sleep, millions of Americans suffer from sleep deprivation and disorders like insomnia. This article explores the paradox, attributing the problem to a mix of behavioral, systemic, and environmental factors. Modern lifestyles, characterized by 'revenge bedtime procrastination' and constant screen use, sabotage rest. Furthermore, systemic issues like housing insecurity, shift work, and the stress of discrimination disproportionately affect the sleep health of marginalized communities. Experts suggest that while personal habits matter, overcoming these larger barriers is crucial for improving the nation's collective sleep.</p>

          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate fell to a lower-than-expected 2.10% in June, extending a slide to its lowest point in over six years. The continued easing, driven by declining food prices, provides more room for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to continue its monetary policy relaxation after a significant rate cut in May. Economists expect inflation to remain low, aided by strong crop production and a good monsoon season, which should boost consumer purchasing power. These conditions could help accelerate India's economic growth, which was a faster-than-expected 7.4% in the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

In a scathing statement, Fifpro president Sergio Marchi accused FIFA of prioritizing revenue at the expense of player health and welfare, adding to an already overloaded fixture schedule. The criticism intensified after Fifpro was reportedly not invited to a key player welfare meeting held by FIFA. This follows a legal complaint filed by the union against FIFA last year, claiming the tournament's expansion abuses European competition law.</p>
