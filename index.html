The BOJ will continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, though trade tensions add complexity to monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised down its economic and inflation projections for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs.
