          <p>The White House has officially addressed President Donald Trump's health, confirming he underwent vascular testing for mild swelling in his lower legs. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the results revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition for his age, with no signs of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. The administration also attributed minor bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, reassuring the public that the president remains in excellent health following his annual physical.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum visited Alcatraz to receive a briefing on reopening the former maximum-security prison, following a directive from President Donald Trump.

          <p>A recent survey by F&G Annuities & Life reveals that 23% of Americans over age 50 are delaying retirement, a significant increase from 14% in the previous year. The primary drivers for this trend are financial uncertainties, with many citing concerns about inflation, potential recessions, and stock market volatility as reasons for postponing their retirement plans. This sentiment is particularly strong among the Gen X demographic, whose oldest members are now approaching the traditional retirement age with insufficient savings to feel secure.</p>

While polls indicate younger voters currently favor Labour and other left-leaning parties, analysts caution that this trend is not guaranteed to hold, especially with the rise of parties like Reform UK on social media. Furthermore, research from other countries and the relatively small size of the 16-17 year-old demographic suggest the overall impact on national election results would likely be negligible, though it could influence outcomes in marginal constituencies.</p>

          <p>A man accused of assaulting police officers during a brawl at Manchester Airport testified that he acted in self-defense because he believed an officer was going to kill him. Mohammed Amaaz, 20, told the jury he was frightened when an officer grabbed him and tried to force him to the ground, leading him to strike out to protect himself and his brother. The prosecution alleges the brothers subjected officers to a high level of violence, which resulted in one officer suffering a broken nose during the altercation.</p>

          <p>The six largest U.S. banks posted strong second-quarter profits, collectively earning around $39 billion, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and a pickup in corporate deal-making. Despite initial fears of a recession due to new tariffs, markets have stabilized, and consumer spending and borrowing remain robust. Bank executives, like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, noted that the corporate community has adapted to uncertainty, leading to a surge in investment banking and a more optimistic economic outlook, contributing to a highly profitable environment for the financial sector.</p>
