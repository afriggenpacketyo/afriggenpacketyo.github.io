          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, describing it as a "spectacular military success." He warned Iran to pursue peace or face further attacks, emphasizing that many targets remain. Trump thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military, noting coordination with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but asserted it would not halt their nuclear program. The targeted sites included Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the U.S. claiming the sites were obliterated, although Iran has downplayed the impact of the strikes. The situation remains tense as Iran has not yet commented on how it will respond to the U.S. action. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, which he hailed as a "spectacular military success." He issued a warning to Iran to pursue a peace deal with Israel or face further attacks, stating that remaining targets could be taken out quickly. The U.S. reportedly used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, also known as bunker-busters, in the strikes. The U.S. communicated to Iran through diplomatic channels that the strikes were limited and did not aim for regime change. Israel was alerted ahead of the strikes, with Prime Minister Netanyahu praising Trump's actions, and Iran confirmed the attacks, claiming they would not stop their nuclear program.</p>

Iranian state media reported casualties and infrastructure damage, while Trump warned of further action if Iran does not seek peace.

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, prompted by Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the original investigation, including blood spots that were not blood at all. Dorotik always maintained her innocence, and the new evidence cast significant doubt on the prosecution's case. Despite the overturned conviction, the DA's office initially sought to retry her, but eventually dismissed the charges due to insufficient evidence, however, the case was dismissed without prejudice, which means, if new evidence surfaces, charges could be brought again someday. Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for incarcerated women.</p>

The U.S. contacted Iran through diplomatic channels to state that the air strikes were all it intended to do and that "regime change efforts" were "not planned", according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Iran has warned of retaliation, potentially targeting U.S. military assets in the region, and Israel is increasing security measures following the strikes.</p>

The Iranian government did not immediately acknowledge the realization of any attacks. The decision to directly involve the United States in the war comes after more than a week of Israeli attacks against Iran, whose objective was to systematically eradicate the country's air defenses and offensive missile capacity, in addition to damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that US warplanes had bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, which he said was "very successful", but the "two-week deadline" for negotiations turned out to be two days. Iran had warned of reprisals if the US joined Israel in attacking its sovereign territory. Now the waiting game begins, and it remains to be seen how Iran will respond to attacks on three of its sites, including Fordo, seen as the crown jewel of its nuclear program. Trump appears to be hoping the US strikes force Iran to make greater concessions at the negotiating table, but it seems unlikely that a nation unwilling to talk while under Israeli attack will be more inclined when American bombs are also falling.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is at risk of splitting into two economies, with the financial sector reviving due to China's resurgent economy, while the food and retail sectors struggle. The city's stock market is benefiting from capital flight to Asia, driven by credit rating downgrades and slower growth in the US. China's use of Hong Kong as a platform for its tech companies is fueling the city's role as a top fundraising venue. State policies and government actions are aimed at maximizing Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>
