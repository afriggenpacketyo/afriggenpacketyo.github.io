          <p>The Trump administration's refugee program for Afrikaners, a White ethnic minority in South Africa, is generating controversy. While some Afrikaners claim they face genocide, others dismiss this as untrue, asserting Whites remain economically strong in South Africa. President Ramaphosa refuted Trump's claims, noting that crime affects all demographics, with Black people being the majority of victims. The program has also sparked debate about the fairness of U.S. refugee policies, with Secretary of State Rubio defending the U.S.'s right to prioritize its interests in selecting immigrants. This article provides context on the complex racial and socio-economic dynamics in South Africa, where Whites still own a disproportionate amount of farmland.</p>

          <p>Craig Steinley, the vice president of the Appraisal Institute, has been removed from his position after multiple women accused him of improper touching.

Steinley denies the allegations, calling his removal a retaliatory act driven by internal politics. The Appraisal Institute stated that its decision was made in the best interest of the group.

          <p>The Trump administration defended its controversial tariffs before a trade court in New York, arguing that striking down the levies would ‚Äúcompletely kneecap‚Äù the US president amid trade talks with China. The lawsuit challenges whether Trump‚Äôs use of a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was legally justified to support the tariffs. The administration argued that the president‚Äôs emergency declarations were not subject to judicial review and that only the US Congress could intervene. The tariffs were imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada over fentanyl production and trafficking.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall in Argentina has caused significant flooding, threatening the country's crops and delaying the harvest. The excessive humidity increases the risk of crop diseases, potentially impacting Argentina's soybean yield. Farmers express concern about the next production cycle, with wheat planting in June likely to be difficult due to the high levels of humidity and water-related problems in the soil. The Buenos Aires Grain Stock Market warned that soybean production might suffer substantial losses due to the ongoing heavy rains.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion ban, allowing abortions to save the life of the mother. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a ‚Äúlife-threatening‚Äù condition as one capable of causing death. While not expanding abortion access or including exceptions for rape or incest, the proposal is a pivot for Texas Republicans, who have long defended the law as written.
