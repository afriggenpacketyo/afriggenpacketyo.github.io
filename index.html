          <p>A letter written by Archibald Gracie, a first-class passenger and survivor of the Titanic disaster, was auctioned for almost $400,000. The letter, penned on April 10, 1912, the day the Titanic set sail, expresses Gracie's initial impressions of the ship. Gracie survived by clinging to an overturned lifeboat but later succumbed to complications from hypothermia. The letter is considered a museum-grade piece, offering a glimpse into the thoughts of a passenger before the tragic sinking. (not investment advice)</p>
