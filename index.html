            <p>Nvidia announced it expects to record a $5.5 billion charge related to the U.S. government's new licensing requirements for exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other countries. This restriction, effective indefinitely, could significantly impact Nvidia's revenue from China, which currently ranks as its fourth-largest market. CEO Jensen Huang has previously acknowledged growing competition within China and warned that further export controls could hinder U.S. competitiveness in technology. The news caused Nvidia's stock to drop, along with shares of other AI chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered Justice Department officials to testify under oath regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador.

The judge intends to determine if the DOJ is actively working to comply with the court orders.

            <p>United Airlines maintained its full-year forecast but issued a second, more conservative outlook in case of a U.S. recession, citing the economy's unpredictability. The airline plans to cut domestic flights starting this summer to match disappointing demand, while international bookings remain strong. CEO Scott Kirby stated the airline's multiyear plan enables it to thrive in any demand environment. The company swung to a profit in the first quarter, outperforming Wall Street expectations.

            <p>A Maryland federal judge is scrutinizing whether the White House is genuinely assisting in the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a Salvadoran prison. Judge Paula Xinis has called for expedited discovery, including questioning government officials under oath, to assess the administration's efforts. The judge seeks to determine if officials are acting in "bad faith" and if enough is being done to bring Abrego Garcia back. The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return.</p>

            <p>President Trump signed an executive action aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, including efforts to reduce costs for seniors and improve Medicare's drug price negotiation program. The action seeks to align Medicare payments with hospital costs and streamline approval for generics and biosimilars. It also directs the Health and Human Services Secretary to work with Congress to address imbalances in drug price negotiation timelines. Critics say consumers could pay more for drugs if the administration applies tariffs to imported pharmaceuticals and ingredients.</p>

The office predicts a substantial drop in exports from China due to the tariffs. China's reliance on the U.S. market will set it back if the tariff rate does not change. China's increasing trade and investment ties with Southeast Asia will help fill the void left by limited access to the U.S. market.</p>

The FTC contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to Facebook, not to help it thrive. The trial could force Meta to divest the two apps.</p>
