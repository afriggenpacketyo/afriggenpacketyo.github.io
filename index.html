          <p>A bill passed by the House would raise taxes on universities like Harvard, immigrants, and foreign companies, while cutting taxes for ideological allies of President Trump. The legislation is designed to target Mr. Trump’s political foils, increasing taxes on wealthy universities and immigrants, and would also see a tax increase for owners of major sports franchises. The bill would also deny tax credits that help cover the cost of health insurance to some migrants who are in the country legally, and impose a new 3.5 percent tax on the remittance payments migrants send to their families overseas. This New York Times article examines the punitive nature of these tax increases and their potential impact on various groups.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is likely to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall, pending further research on vaccine effectiveness in these groups. While vaccines will likely remain available for those 65 and older or with underlying conditions, this decision could create new barriers to vaccination for many. Experts warn that these restrictions may disproportionately affect low-income individuals and raise concerns about protecting vulnerable populations. The article explores the potential implications of the FDA's plan and the challenges it poses for public health.</p>

          <p>Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, defends his university against what he sees as "unhinged" invective, arguing that critics engage in "splitting" by portraying Harvard as either an exalted angel or an odious evildoer. Pinker acknowledges Harvard's genuine shortcomings, including the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, but rejects the notion that it is a "woke madrasa." He calls for a more nuanced approach to addressing the university's problems, rather than punitive measures that would harm its mission of discovering and transmitting knowledge.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores how tech leaders and the far-right have adopted J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" to support their ideologies, often misinterpreting the trilogy's themes. Silicon Valley figures like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel draw inspiration from the books to justify their pursuit of power and innovation. The far-right uses the series to promote traditional hierarchies and a romanticized past. The article critiques these interpretations, arguing that they overlook Tolkien's cautionary messages about the corrupting influence of power and the importance of humility.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by the House would significantly hinder the electric vehicle (EV) industry by repealing subsidies for battery manufacturing, EV purchases, and charging stations. This would make electric vehicles more expensive and slow their adoption in the United States, potentially benefiting China, which dominates the EV supply chain. The legislation also imposes a new annual fee on EV owners, further disincentivizing their use. The article highlights the political divide over clean energy and the potential consequences for American manufacturing and environmental goals.</p>

          <p>Faced with President Trump's demand for NATO allies to spend 5% of their national income on defense, European countries are considering broadening the definition of security-related spending. The proposed plan involves a target of military spending at 3.5% of GDP, plus another 1.5% for nontraditional “defense-related” spending, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. This approach reflects efforts to appease Mr. Trump while acknowledging the need for increased European investment in defense capabilities.

The article highlights that prices remain high despite the decrease and that customers on existing fixed deals will not benefit from the summer price drop.
