          <p>While a majority of U.S. adults dream of being their own boss, common obstacles like financial insecurity, fear of failure, and a lack of business knowledge often prevent them from starting. Business experts suggest that these hurdles can be overcome with strategic planning and a shift in mindset. They recommend starting with a smaller financial safety net, such as three to six months of expenses, and testing a business idea as a side hustle first. Additionally, building a solid business plan and seeking mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs can provide the necessary foundation and confidence to launch successfully.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists, fund managers, and strategists reveals widespread concern over President Trump's influence on the Federal Reserve. An overwhelming 82% of respondents believe his actions are an attempt to limit or eliminate the central bank's independence. Majorities in the survey predict these actions will lead to negative economic outcomes, including weaker growth, higher inflation, and increased unemployment. This sentiment highlights a significant apprehension within the financial community that political interference in monetary policy could destabilize the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology firm Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium involved in a framework deal aimed at allowing TikTok to continue its U.S. operations. The negotiations between the Trump administration and China are complex, with the final structure still unclear but set to include a mix of new and existing investors. This potential agreement follows years of national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and its control over user data and algorithms. Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison has ties to President Trump, has previously partnered with TikTok to manage U.S. user data.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has internally evaluated its models for "frontier risks," which are potential large-scale threats to public safety, according to a source familiar with the matter. This move aligns with Beijing's recent push to increase safety awareness within its rapidly growing AI industry. Unlike their U.S. counterparts such as OpenAI and Anthropic, Chinese AI companies have not publicly released the results of such safety assessments. The evaluation signifies a growing global focus on the potential dangers of highly advanced artificial intelligence systems and the need for robust safety protocols.</p>

          <p>Robert Redford, an iconic actor known for his roles in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "The Sting," has passed away at the age of 89.

          <p>As winter approaches, European Union gas reserves are currently just over 80% full, a level lower than the past few years but still considered a solid buffer against potential supply disruptions. Since reducing its reliance on Russian energy, the EU has diversified its sources, primarily turning to liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S., Norway, and Qatar. While the immediate energy crisis has subsided, the bloc remains vulnerable to geopolitical pressures, including potential U.S. tariffs on countries trading Russian energy.

This shift could arise from a re-evaluation of national priorities and the limitations of American hard power. The argument is that as the U.S. turns inward to address what it perceives as domestic threats, its ambition for global intervention and confrontation might decrease.</p>

This process, evidenced by cut and burn marks on the remains, would have preserved the deceased, allowing relatives to maintain a connection with their ancestors.

          <p>A new report from FICO indicates that U.S. consumers are showing increased signs of financial stress due to persistent inflation and higher interest rates. The national average FICO score has dipped slightly, with Gen Z adults experiencing the sharpest decline, largely driven by pressures from student loan repayments. Student loan delinquencies have reached a record high, with over 10% of monitored borrowers falling behind on payments. While the average credit score remains near historic highs, the data suggests underlying weaknesses are emerging in consumer credit health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the artificial intelligence boom is poised to become one of the most efficient mechanisms for upward wealth redistribution in modern history. The author contends that the massive valuations of AI companies are predicated on their potential to eliminate jobs, from coding to warehouse work, thereby enriching a small class of tech billionaires. This trend exacerbates existing economic and social divisions created by the "knowledge economy." The article questions whether a societal focus on high-tech development at all costs is desirable, suggesting a greater investment in low-tech, essential labor is needed for the common good.

          <p>Nurses in California are reporting an increase in the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals, creating what they describe as a hostile and unsafe environment. They allege that agents are interfering with patient care, violating privacy laws by listening to conversations, and preventing patients from contacting family. This trend follows a Trump administration executive order that removed the "sensitive locations" status from healthcare facilities, which had previously limited immigration enforcement actions. Healthcare workers fear this will deter sick immigrants from seeking necessary medical attention.</p>

          <p>Luckin Coffee, the chain that surpassed Starbucks as the largest in China, has launched its first locations in New York City, marking a significant entry into the U.S. market. The company operates a cashierless model, with all orders placed through a mobile app that heavily features discounts and coupons. While its initial U.S. stores are reportedly operating at a loss to build brand awareness, the move signals a bold challenge to Starbucks. Luckin's expansion comes after a dramatic history that includes a 2020 accounting fraud scandal, delisting from the Nasdaq, and a subsequent corporate restructuring.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical context for Zionism, tracing its origins to the late 19th century as a nationalist movement akin to others emerging in Europe at the time. It highlights the diversity of thought within early Zionism, noting that its goals were not monolithically defined as statehood and encompassed a wide range of secular and religious viewpoints. The movement, formally organized at the 1897 Basel congress, was a pragmatic response to rising European nationalism and antisemitism. The author argues that understanding this complex history is crucial to moving beyond simplistic or pejorative uses of the term "Zionist" in contemporary discourse.</p>

          <p>Guest-hosting Charlie Kirk's podcast, Vice President JD Vance encouraged listeners to "call out" and even contact the employers of individuals perceived to be celebrating the killing of the conservative activist. His comments endorse a mass "doxing" campaign that has already led to numerous people being fired for their social media posts about Kirk's death. The campaign, facilitated by an anonymous website, has raised significant concerns about free speech and intimidation. Vance's stance, echoed by other administration officials, signals a commitment to what they term enforcing "civility" through public and professional consequences.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has directed the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to launch a new investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to multiple courts. The case involves an MI5 informant, a neo-Nazi known as Agent X, who used his protected status to coerce and attack his girlfriend. MI5 had falsely claimed to courts that it had not confirmed the agent's status to the BBC, a claim later proven untrue. This new inquiry follows rulings from two separate courts which found MI5's internal investigations into the matter to be procedurally deficient and unreliable.</p>

The forum highlights the growing strategic competition with the United States, evidenced by the differing levels of diplomatic representation each country sends to the other's preferred security conference.

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, progressive organizations are expressing alarm as President Trump and his allies call for investigations into what they term a "radical left" network. A letter from House Freedom Caucus members requested a select committee to probe NGOs, donors, and media, linking disparate events to a coordinated assault on America. Targeted groups fear this rhetoric is creating a chilling effect reminiscent of McCarthyism and the "red scare" of the 1950s. They argue the goal is to silence dissent and quash political opposition through intimidation and baseless allegations.</p>
