          <p>Jesús Montero, a former top prospect for the New York Yankees who later played for the Seattle Mariners, has passed away at the age of 35. The Yankees organization confirmed the death of the Venezuelan native, expressing condolences to his family. According to reports and a GoFundMe page established for his medical bills, Montero was involved in a motorcycle crash in Venezuela earlier in the month, which resulted in him being placed in a coma from which he did not recover. Once ranked among baseball's most promising young talents, Montero's career included a significant trade that brought Michael Pineda to New York.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was severely tested after Israel launched air and artillery strikes, alleging that Hamas had violated the truce by firing on its soldiers, resulting in two Israeli deaths. In response, Israel hit multiple targets and halted the flow of humanitarian aid into the territory "until further notice." Hamas's armed wing denied involvement in the reported clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. The renewed violence led to at least 38 deaths in Gaza, according to hospital sources, casting significant doubt on the stability of the U.S.-brokered peace efforts and the next phase of negotiations.</p>

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident and will examine the damaged multilayer windshield to determine the cause of the crack, including whether it was struck by an object mid-flight.</p>

          <p>Atlanta United has fired head coach Ronny Deila following a deeply disappointing season where the team managed only five wins and finished 14th in the Eastern Conference. The decision came after the club failed to meet high expectations set by Deila's previous MLS Cup-winning record and significant investments in new players. In a statement, CEO Garth Lagerwey acknowledged that the team's standard of play was not met and that a global search for a replacement would begin immediately. Deila's tenure lasted less than a year, marking another period of instability for a club that has not won a trophy since 2019.</p>

          <p>Sam Rivers, the original bassist and a founding member of the nu-metal band Limp Bizkit, has died at the age of 48. The band confirmed his passing in a social media post, remembering him as "pure magic" and the "soul in the sound." While the cause of death was not disclosed, Rivers had previously taken a hiatus from the band in 2015 due to severe liver disease from excessive drinking, later receiving a transplant and rejoining in 2018. Frontman Fred Durst shared a heartfelt tribute, recalling how he was blown away by Rivers' talent upon first seeing him play in a Florida bar before forming the band.</p>

          <p>The deal for Rangers to appoint Kevin Muscat as their new head coach has collapsed. Advanced discussions were held with the former Ibrox player, but complications arose due to his current role as manager of Shanghai Port in the Chinese Super League. The Chinese league's title race could extend into November or December, creating a delayed start date that proved unworkable for both parties. The club is now considering other candidates and expects to make an appointment in the coming days after former manager Russell Martin was dismissed earlier in the month following a poor start to the season.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump sharply criticized Colombian President Gustavo Petro, calling him an "illegal drug dealer" and threatening an immediate halt to U.S. funding for the country. The accusation, posted on Truth Social, comes amid rising tensions over U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, which Petro has condemned as a violation of sovereignty. In his post, Trump claimed Petro encourages drug production and warned that if the "killing fields" are not closed, the U.S. will do it for him. The remarks signal a significant strain in the relationship between the U.S. and one of its key Latin American allies.</p>

Trump allegedly warned that Putin threatened to "destroy" Ukraine if it did not comply with these demands.

The episode seemed to be a direct response to those who have characterized her persona as subservient or overly sexualized.

Many fear a repeat of a previous ceasefire in March that ended with a return to full-scale war.

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Hints at Potential VAT Cut on Energy Bills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 12:38:40 EDT</div>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he declined to speculate ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential move comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, which remain high by historical standards. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household around £86 per year, but the long-term solution, Miliband argued, is a transition to home-grown clean energy.</p>

          <p>A minor diplomatic stir occurred after U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wore a striped tie in the colors of the Russian flag during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The white, blue, and red tie was highlighted by Russian state media Tass as a striking choice given the context of the meeting. The incident fueled speculation about the Trump administration's shifting stance on Ukraine, especially following reports of delayed military aid. While Vice President JD Vance defended the tie as simply representing American colors, critics pointed to it as symbolic of a troubling alignment with Russia.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has defended his party's proposal for a wealth tax, framing it as a necessary measure to tackle "deep inequality." The plan involves an annual tax of 1% on assets over £10 million and 2% on those over £1 billion. Speaking to the BBC, Polanski argued that while the tax would not be a panacea, its primary goal is to reduce the gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of society. He also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, stating that unearned wealth should be taxed as much as earned income.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson stood by his characterization of the recent nationwide "No Kings" protests against Donald Trump as "hate America" rallies. In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Johnson clarified that his comment was directed at the "hateful messages" and "violent rhetoric" of the protesters, not at Democrats in general. He defended his remarks linking anarchists and antifa to the modern Democratic Party by pointing to what he described as a "rise of Marxism" within the party. Johnson also argued that the "No Kings" branding was ironic, suggesting that if Trump were a king, the government would not be shut down.</p>

          <p>A leaked Telegram group chat containing racist, homophobic, and antisemitic messages has revealed and deepened a significant rift within the Young Republican National Federation. The offensive texts, which included slurs and a call to sexually assault the group's chair, Hayden Padgett, have fractured the organization along factional lines from a recent contentious leadership election. State chapters that supported Padgett quickly condemned the messages, while many that backed his opponent, who was in the chat, remained silent or questioned the context. The scandal highlights years of bitter infighting and a toxic internal culture within the youth political group.</p>

          <p>Approximately 91,585 pounds of frozen breakfast burritos and wraps distributed through federally-funded school meal programs have been recalled due to potential listeria contamination. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the recall for products made by M.C.I. Foods between September and October. The contamination was discovered during routine testing of egg ingredients from an external supplier. While there have been no confirmed reports of illness, institutions are being urged to discard the affected products, which were sold under brands like El Mas Fino and Los Cabos.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an end to U.S. funding for Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of doing nothing to stop the production of drugs destined for the United States. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that if Petro does not "close up these killing fields," the U.S. will do it for him. The move marks a dramatic escalation in tensions between the two countries, which have been strained by Trump's military strikes against alleged "narcoterrorists" and the recent revocation of Petro's visa after he participated in a pro-Palestinian protest in New York.</p>
