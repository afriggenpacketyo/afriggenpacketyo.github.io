          <p>The United States and Japan have established a significant trade deal, setting a new tariff rate of 15% on Japanese imports, including a reduction for automobiles from a potential 25%. As part of the agreement, President Trump announced that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American goods like trucks and agricultural products. The deal was celebrated by both nations, with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba highlighting its alignment with the national interests of both countries and noting it could bolster his political standing domestically. The announcement prompted a surge in Japanese markets, particularly for major auto manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During Bryan Kohberger's sentencing for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, family members of the victims delivered powerful impact statements. The prosecutor detailed the plea deal, which spared Kohberger the death penalty, and displayed photos of the victims, emphasizing the profound loss. While some relatives expressed their unending grief, Xana Kernodle's aunt offered a surprising statement of forgiveness directly to Kohberger, stating she could no longer live with hatred. The emotional hearing provided a platform for the families to share their pain and memories of their loved ones, seeking a sense of closure as Kohberger faces life in prison.</p>

          <p>The son of a woman killed in the recent Air India crash discovered that his mother's casket contained remains belonging to other individuals after it was returned to the UK. This incident has amplified concerns about the handling and identification of the 260 victims, with reports of other families receiving incorrect remains. India's foreign ministry stated that all remains were handled with professionalism according to established protocols but acknowledged the concerns and is working with UK officials. The tragic mix-up adds another layer of grief for the families, who are now demanding urgent answers and assurances from both governments.</p>

          <p>In their first public statements, the surviving roommates of the Idaho murder victims, Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke, spoke at Bryan Kohberger's sentencing. Mortensen tearfully described how the murders shattered her life, leaving her with constant panic attacks and an inability to trust the world, but defiantly stated that the killer could not take her voice or her memories. Funke's statement, read by a friend, conveyed deep survivor's guilt and detailed the harassment she faced from the media and online speculators following the tragedy. Both women expressed their commitment to living their lives in honor of their slain friends.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to meet with officials from Israel and Qatar in Rome to push forward negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza. The talks are focused on a U.S.-backed proposal for a 60-day truce that would involve a phased release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of the region. President Trump has expressed optimism about the deal, urging Hamas to accept the terms, which he claims will not improve. A successful agreement could also pave the way for an expansion of the Abraham Accords, potentially normalizing relations between Israel and other neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out over 300,000 deportations in a year, the highest number since the Obama administration in 2014.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are debating a proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax on home sales, a move floated by President Trump as a way to unlock the housing market. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue that the tax discourages homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and downsizing, and that removing it would increase housing inventory. However, critics contend that the tax primarily affects high-end homeowners and would not address the core market problem, which they attribute to a lack of confidence and economic uncertainty created by the administration's policies.

          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria by making a single amino acid change in their genome using CRISPR gene-editing technology. The study, published in Nature, found that this small tweak effectively prevents the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the mosquito's salivary glands, a crucial step for transmission. Scientists believe this genetic modification could be spread through wild mosquito populations using a gene drive, potentially transforming them into a version that cannot transmit the deadly disease. While the technology is promising, it remains controversial due to potential unforeseen ecological consequences.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has warned investors to stay away from the recent revival in meme stock trading, which has seen speculative surges in companies like Kohl's and GoPro. During his "Morning Meeting" segment, Cramer expressed a preference for legitimate, fundamental-based investing over the orchestrated short squeezes driven by retail traders on social media platforms. While cautioning against the meme trend, he also highlighted positive market news, such as the strong quarterly performance of GE Vernova, which he described as a potentially top story in the market.

Bonta stated that receivership is the only remaining option to ensure the safety and well-being of the youth in custody.

          <p>Shares of Texas Instruments fell by 12% despite the company reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations. The stock's decline was driven by a third-quarter forecast that fell short of estimates and comments from CEO Haviv Ilan about ongoing market uncertainty. Ilan noted that while the company saw some strength, it may have been due to customers buying inventory ahead of potential tariffs. He also warned of a "shallow" recovery in the automotive sector and lingering concerns among customers about geopolitical instability, which overshadowed the positive quarterly results.

Experts warn that the government's thin support base and the presence of extremist elements pose a significant challenge to achieving long-term stability.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Florida have made a potentially significant breakthrough in the development of a universal cancer vaccine. In a study on mice, an experimental mRNA vaccine, designed to broadly stimulate the immune system rather than target a specific cancer, was shown to greatly enhance the effectiveness of common immunotherapy drugs. The vaccine works by waking up the immune system to fight cancer as if it were a virus. If these findings can be replicated in humans, it could lead to an off-the-shelf vaccine that could be used across a wide range of cancer types.</p>

          <p>This article breaks down how the minimum payment on a credit card balance is typically calculated, using a $2,000 debt as an example. It explains common formulas used by issuers, such as a flat percentage of the balance or a percentage plus interest and fees, which would result in a minimum payment of roughly $40 to $60. The piece strongly advises against paying only the minimum, as compounding interest makes it a very slow and expensive way to become debt-free. It also suggests alternative strategies for those struggling with debt, such as balance transfers or debt consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>
