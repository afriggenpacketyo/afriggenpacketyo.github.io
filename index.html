          <p>Kyoto plans to implement Japan's highest accommodation tax, potentially up to $65 per person per night, starting in March 2026. This measure aims to combat overtourism, fund cultural site preservation, and alleviate strain on local infrastructure. City officials argue tourists should bear these costs, as residents report the city becoming unlivable during peak seasons due to crowds and incidents. Critics question if the tax will be sufficient given Japan's goal of 60 million tourists by 2030.</p>

          <p>Former national security official David Feith warns that Chinese entities acquiring land near US military bases pose significant national security risks, including potential espionage or military attacks. He cites drone attacks in Ukraine as an example of new warfare methods. While Chinese ownership is less than 1% of foreign-owned agricultural land, 29 states now limit or ban such purchases. Concerns also extend to Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining operations near sensitive facilities, which could be used for intelligence or sabotaging the power grid.</p>

          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns of alarming parallels between today's AI-fueled stock market boom and the speculative fervor preceding the 1929 crash. He notes a "sugar rush" in the economy, rising debt, and a rollback of investor protection regulations, suggesting an inevitable, though unpredictable, market crash. Sorkin also highlights a push to "democratize" investing by allowing ordinary Americans into riskier private equity and cryptocurrency, reminiscent of the pre-1929 credit-fueled speculation.
