          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after a standstill during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for luxury cruises has increased, leading to record domestic passenger numbers and a boost to local economies that rely on tourism. Japanese shipping giants, such as NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd., are investing in cruise ships to generate stable income streams amid challenges in their core cargo businesses due to import tariffs. The industry anticipates further growth, with domestic passenger numbers expected to exceed 250,000 in 2025 and potentially approach the 2019 record high next year.</p>

Witnesses reported that the suspect yelled "free Palestine" during the attack, which is being treated as a targeted act of violence.

          <p>With the Trump administration's focus on deporting undocumented immigrants, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles warns that U.S. residents may face increased scrutiny when returning from international travel. While citizens are unlikely to be questioned, residents could face discretion from immigration officials, especially if they have been outside the U.S. for more than six months or have a criminal record. Individuals with DACA or TPS status also face risks, although they can apply for advance parole, which is currently limited for DACA recipients. The attorney advises residents planning extended stays abroad to apply for a re-entry permit and those with criminal records to consult an immigration lawyer.</p>

          <p>More than 50 people were killed and many more wounded in an attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. The Israeli military denies its forces were involved, stating an initial inquiry found no evidence of firing at civilians. Witnesses reported fire coming from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated it delivered aid without incident and dismissed reports of deaths and injuries, though past distributions by GHF have been marred by chaos and accusations of Israeli troops firing on crowds.

          <p>Universities in England are facing financial strain due to a drop in international students and rising inflation, leading to course cutbacks and potential subject "cold spots." A government review is underway to address long-term funding for higher education. Universities UK suggests greater collaboration between institutions could help mitigate costs and prevent the isolated closure or merging of courses. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial challenges and supports collaboration where possible, such as sharing back-office functions and discussing mergers. However, existing competition laws hinder open discussions about course offerings and regional needs.</p>

The report highlights the widespread displacement of families across England and calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, with nearly 94,000 in London alone.

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing criticism after approving a law that allows the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation in certain cases. The Expropriation Act, intended to increase black ownership of land, has drawn opposition from the U.S. President Donald Trump, who views it as discriminatory against white farmers. Legal experts clarify that expropriation without compensation would only occur in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The government argues that the law is necessary to address historical inequalities and restore land to those dispossessed during white-minority rule.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing and returning her pardon. Hemphill stated that the pardons contribute to a false narrative and that those involved were guilty. She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's decision contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who have embraced their pardons and used them in legal arguments.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is campaigning to correct what he believes is an unfair discrepancy in his military pension. Williams, who served for 18 years, says he was discharged in 1970, while others who applied for redundancy at the same time were discharged in 1972, receiving a substantially better pension due to rule changes. Despite numerous appeals, the Ministry of Defence maintains that Williams' pension reflects his full and correct entitlement based on the rules at the time. Williams hopes to bring attention to his case and find other affected veterans.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses how President Trump's unpredictable policies and actions are creating a "Trump discount" in the stock market, deterring investors and causing instability. He points to several sectors, including Nvidia, retail, drug companies, Apple, and energy, where uncertainty stemming from the White House is negatively affecting stock performance. Cramer suggests that the market's volatility and lack of predictability are driving investors to seek more stable opportunities in Europe. He also notes the unusual embrace of left-leaning cases by the Trump administration, such as the antitrust case against Google. (not investment advice)</p>

The election follows President Yoon Suk Yeol's attempt to orchestrate a military takeover, which led to his impeachment. The ruling party's candidate, Kim Moon-soo, initially defended Yoon's actions, turning the election into a referendum on martial law. Lee has gained support by promising to prevent future attempts to declare martial law, while Kim's campaign has struggled due to divisions within the conservative party.</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that Earth's atmosphere will eventually revert to a state rich in methane and low in oxygen, similar to its condition before the Great Oxidation Event. This shift is expected to occur in about a billion years and will happen relatively quickly. The decrease in oxygen will be caused by changes in the brightness of the Sun and a corresponding drop in carbon dioxide levels, leading to fewer photosynthesizing organisms. This event will likely lead to the extinction of humans and most other life forms that rely on oxygen, but microbial life will continue to exist.</p>
