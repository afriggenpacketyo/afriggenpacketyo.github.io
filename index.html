          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE to discuss various critical issues. Key topics include potential Israel-Gaza ceasefire talks, oil and trade agreements, and investments in AI infrastructure. The visit also aims to address policy developments related to advanced semiconductor exports and nuclear programs, with expectations for significant announcements in these areas. Trump's close ties with Gulf Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, may strengthen their negotiating positions, although potential conflicts of interest have raised concerns among critics. The trip underscores the growing importance of the Gulf region in global economics and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article delves into the preserved SoHo building where conceptual artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude lived and worked for approximately 50 years. The building at 48 Howard Street remains almost exactly as it was when they occupied it, featuring Christo's sketches and art supplies in the top-floor studio. The article explores the possibility of opening the home to the public and the challenges of making structural updates while preserving its authenticity. The artists, known for their massive, site-specific installations, financed their own projects to maintain independence and avoid commercial influence, creating fleeting, monumental pieces that sparked public dialogue.</p>

          <p>Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham were found guilty of criminal damage for felling the Sycamore Gap tree, a beloved landmark in northern England, the New York Times reports. The sycamore, which stood for 150 years along Hadrian's Wall and was featured in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," was cut down in September 2023. The motive remains unclear, but evidence suggested it was an act of vandalism. Despite their denials, cellphone data, CCTV footage, and traffic camera evidence placed both men at the scene. They will be sentenced on July 15 and face up to 10 years in prison, while efforts are underway to regrow the tree from sprouts and seeds.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced a second air traffic control outage on Friday morning, adding to a week of disruptions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that a telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar displays at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark. The outage lasted approximately 90 seconds and occurred around 3:55 a.m. This incident follows similar issues experienced the previous week, prompting United Airlines to limit flights to and from Newark, citing safety concerns due to FAA staffing issues.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, Kosmos 482, is predicted to crash back to Earth after 53 years in orbit, posing a minimal risk to human life. The spacecraft, initially intended for a Venus mission, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts estimate that some components, especially the landing capsule, may survive reentry, but most of the spacecraft is expected to burn up in the atmosphere. Space debris crashing back to Earth is becoming a growing problem for aircraft, according to researchers.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While most of the spacecraft is expected to burn up during reentry, there is a small chance that some pieces, particularly the landing capsule, could survive and impact the Earth's surface. The risk to humans is considered low, similar to that of a random meteorite fall, but experts warn of a growing problem for aircraft due to increasing space debris.</p>

The administration plans to send government officials to Washington Dulles International Airport for an event marking the arrival of 54 Afrikaners. The South African government has expressed doubts about the U.S.'s assessment that Afrikaners qualify for refugee status, saying their claims of discrimination do not meet international refugee law standards. The resettlement highlights the administrationâ€™s differing treatment of refugees and its focus on white South Africans, who claim they are denied jobs and targeted by criminals due to their race.</p>

He assisted in setting up a death squad for dictator Luis Garcia Meza and worked with neo-Nazi mercenaries to suppress political opposition and cocaine production rivals.

          <p>Anti-abortion activists are launching a campaign called "Rolling Thunder" to pressure the FDA to reinstate restrictions on mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortions. They plan to bring new lawsuits against doctors who prescribe the medication and lobby to remove the drug from the market. A new report claiming high rates of complications from mifepristone is being used to support these efforts. The Trump administration's position is mixed, with concerns about restricting access while also protecting the ability to impose limitations. The FDA maintains it is committed to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of regulated products.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate analysts observe a notable trend of apartment renters renewing their leases instead of moving, with turnover rates significantly lower than usual. Reasons cited include the unaffordability of the for-sale market, limited rental supply, economic concerns, and a shift toward suburban apartments. This trend benefits landlords through better pricing on renewals and reduced turnover costs. Analysts favor REITs like Essex Property Trust and Equity Residential, which have a strong presence on the West Coast. Overall, rents are rebounding after declines, driven by strong demand and decreased vacancy rates.</p>

          <p>The U.K. and U.S. have reached a trade deal that includes tariffs, indicating a continued trend in Trump's trade policies. While the U.K. secured tariff-free exports for steel and aluminum and a 10% rate for 100,000 vehicles annually, all other goods remain subject to a 10% baseline tariff. This deal, viewed as a template for future agreements, suggests that few countries will be entirely tariff-free. Analysts believe the deal implies a minimum 10% tariff for most trading partners, with some flexibility on sectoral tariffs.</p>

          <p>Republicans are exploring options to reduce Medicaid spending, and a major cut under consideration would disproportionately affect poorer, Southern states. This cut involves limiting how states use a tax loophole to increase federal Medicaid funding. This policy shift could lead to significant budget shortfalls in affected states, potentially causing them to reduce health insurance coverage for lower-income adults or cut hospital payments. Speaker Mike Johnson has ruled out major cuts to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, leaving the provider tax loophole as the primary target for achieving Republicans' budget goals.</p>

These tariffs, particularly on goods from China, where many baby essentials are manufactured, are driving up prices on items like car seats and strollers. Advocates are calling for exemptions on critical baby products, arguing that the tariffs create a "baby tax" on parents. While Trump has hinted at a possible carveout, he prefers simple tariff structures, leaving families to face rising expenses.</p>

India's missile strikes into Pakistan, followed by retaliatory actions, have raised tensions to levels unseen since the Kargil War. While both sides have expressed a desire to avoid further escalation, the lack of an obvious off-ramp and the presence of misinformation complicate de-escalation efforts. The United States, traditionally a crisis broker, faces challenges due to strained relations with Pakistan, leaving the international community searching for effective ways to mediate the conflict. There are fears that if the missile strikes continue, it could lead to a larger conflict.</p>
