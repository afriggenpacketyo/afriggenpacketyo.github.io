          <p>Lord Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is under intense pressure to resign following new revelations about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Reports indicate over 100 emails between them, including one where Mandelson reportedly urged Epstein to "fight for early release" and stated, "your friends stay with you and love you." Downing Street insists due process was followed in his appointment, but faces scrutiny for not adequately vetting the extent of this connection. The controversy has sparked cross-party fury and exasperation among Labour MPs, raising questions about Prime Minister Starmer's judgment.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high of 44,396.95, mirroring Wall Street gains fueled by hopes for Fed rate cuts and positive inflation data. Tech investment firm SoftBank Group surged over 10% for a second consecutive day following a report that OpenAI secured a substantial cloud-computing deal with Oracle. This development highlights the growing connection between SoftBank and Oracle through initiatives like the Stargate program, further boosting investor confidence in the tech sector. Energy and utilities stocks also contributed to the Nikkei's rise, while other Asian markets showed mixed results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University, as confirmed by President Donald Trump. Utah Governor Spencer Cox labeled the incident a "political assassination," and a manhunt for the suspected shooter is ongoing, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. Initial detentions of two individuals yielded no ties to the shooting, intensifying the search for the lone gunman believed to have fired from a distance. The 31-year-old conservative figure's death has prompted widespread condolences and calls for an end to political violence across the nation.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung stated that Korean companies would be "very hesitant" to invest in the US after a large immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean workers, initially detained for working illegally, are set to return home, with their departure delayed by the White House. Lee highlighted the common practice of sending workers to set up overseas factories and expressed concern that such actions could make establishing manufacturing facilities in the US more difficult. The incident has caused a "shock" in South Korea, raising questions about the US-Korea alliance amidst ongoing trade talks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock markets worldwide are experiencing a significant rally, with the MSCI All Country World Index and the S&P 500 hitting fresh record highs. This surge is attributed to easing inflation pressures, robust corporate earnings, and strong expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, politicians from both sides of the aisle have issued strong condemnations, though some congressional debates revealed partisan divisions. President Trump announced Kirk's death, blaming "radical left" rhetoric for the "terrorism" and ordering flags lowered to half-staff. Former Presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton also decried the violence, emphasizing its lack of place in democracy and calling for civility. Despite calls for unity, a moment of silence in Congress devolved into a shouting match, highlighting the deep political tensions exacerbated by the tragedy.</p>

She suggests that even without Trump, a return to the past kinship is unlikely, with the most optimistic outcome being a transactional relationship based on converging interests. Tocci warns against European leaders' current strategy of appeasing Trump, as it risks further colonizing Europe within a world of competing empires. She advocates for Europe to develop strategic autonomy, diversify trade, and build alternative international systems to avoid being violently pushed down the global food chain.</p>

Geologists have mapped 163 mineral types and found over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, enhancing China's energy security and optimizing its resource structures. These findings, particularly in deep basins and offshore waters, have supported stable annual oil and natural gas production, reducing reliance on imports.</p>

However, "normal" does not equate to affordable; in July 2018, San Francisco households spent 74% of their income on mortgages.

          <p>A home in Los Angeles' Fairfax District, dubbed the "Trash House" due to three-foot-high stacks of garbage bags, has reignited controversy. While some neighbors view it as a public health hazard, others defend homeowner Raymond Gaon, a Vietnam veteran, as a misunderstood individual meticulously collecting materials for recycling. Mayor Karen Bass previously declared it a "public health emergency," leading to a cleanup. Advocates for Gaon emphasize his private nature and routines, urging compassion and mediation over public spectacle, highlighting challenges in addressing complex living situations while respecting individual autonomy and community concerns.</p>

          <p>China has inaugurated the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world’s longest cable-stayed bridge, stretching 10.3km with a main span of 1,208 meters. This engineering marvel is the first crossing on the Yangtze to simultaneously carry an expressway, a regular road, and an intercity railway. A distinctive feature is its asymmetrical lower deck, with a high-speed railway on one side and a regular road on the other, a unique side-by-side traffic layout for a large-span bridge. This achievement significantly cuts travel time between Changzhou and Taizhou, showcasing China's advanced infrastructure development capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, continuing a legal battle over her removal. Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook made a strong showing that her purported removal violated the Federal Reserve Act, which requires "cause" for such actions, and cited public interest in Fed independence. Trump claimed he fired Cook due to mortgage fraud allegations, which she denies, arguing it's a pretext for pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates. The outcome could significantly impact the Fed's independence and Trump's ability to shape the central bank's board. (not investment advice)</p>

Long Beach officials reported no major injuries, deeming it a "miracle," though one worker was treated at the scene. An oil spill response team is containing the sheen, believed to be renewable diesel, while the port remains operational.

          <p>Thousands of residents in rural West Virginia, particularly in areas like Raleigh County, lack reliable access to clean drinking water, often relying on untreated sources like abandoned coal mines. For nearly 50 years, many, like Roman Patsey, have had to dig their own trenches for water, without knowing its safety. The decline of the coal industry, which once maintained local water systems, has left infrastructure crumbling, with treatment plants in disrepair. Non-profit organizations like DigDeep are now working to replace these systems, highlighting that access to clean water is a fundamental human right that many in the Appalachian Mountains are currently denied.</p>

          <p>Senior cancer doctors in England warn that excessive red tape creates an unacceptable "postcode lottery" for patients seeking the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists states that applying for funding for new therapies, even established ones like SABR radiotherapy, is cumbersome, limiting access to larger units. This inequity means some patients miss life-saving care. While the government plans a new cancer strategy, charities also highlight worsening delays in cancer diagnoses, with only half of urgent referrals receiving news within the 28-day target, underscoring systemic healthcare challenges.</p>

Harris, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out, views the decision as "recklessness" given the high stakes. She also expresses deep criticism of Biden's inner circle, alleging they failed to defend her and even fueled negative narratives about her "chaotic" office. While defending Biden's capacity, Harris acknowledges he "got tired" but asserts her loyalty to the country above all.</p>

Despite lagging in advanced chips, China believes its "usable" chips are sufficient for its goal. This resourcefulness, coupled with state-backed investments in hardware startups, aims to overcome US restrictions and achieve its 2030 ambition of becoming a global AI innovation center, despite warnings of potential overcapacity.
