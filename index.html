The ministry also stated that two children died from starvation, contributing to a growing number of such deaths. Amid the ongoing violence, the World Health Organization's director-general expressed support for a U.S.-proposed peace plan, emphasizing that peace is the best solution for the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>With one month until Election Day 2025, the influence of President Donald Trump is a dominant factor in key state-level races, particularly the gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia. These elections are widely viewed as early indicators of public sentiment toward Trump's second-term agenda and will serve as important barometers ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Other significant political battles include a ballot proposition on congressional redistricting in California and crucial state Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, which could shape the political landscape for years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Britain has discovered that the far side of the moon may be colder than its near side. This finding is based on the analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the lunar far side by China's Chang'e-6 mission. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that minerals from the far side formed in interior lava temperatures approximately 100 degrees Celsius lower than those on the near side, providing new insights into the moon's asymmetrical evolution.</p>

In a farewell note, Ben’Ary stated his termination appeared to be based on false information and expressed concern that political considerations were taking precedence over national security. His sudden removal occurred while he was leading the prosecution in a major terrorism case involving the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The composition and tone of the White House press corps have reportedly shifted significantly during Donald Trump's second term, with a noticeable increase in reporters from supportive right-wing media outlets. This change has led to more laudatory and less critical questions during press briefings, allowing the administration to control the narrative and avoid difficult inquiries from mainstream journalists. Critics argue this tactic undermines press freedom and accountability by surrounding the president with sycophantic voices rather than independent watchdogs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $7.6 billion in grants designated for 223 clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which supported the Democratic party in the last presidential election. The White House budget director characterized the move as eliminating funding for the "Left’s climate agenda." Critics, however, have condemned the decision as a vindictive political act that will eliminate jobs, increase energy costs, and undermine the country's transition to renewable energy sources like hydrogen and upgraded electrical grids.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with the immense challenge of achieving its 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target, a goal that hinges on the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the UK and EU have implemented mandates requiring a small percentage of jet fuel to be sustainable, some industry leaders, like Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, are deeply skeptical that production can scale up to meet future, more ambitious targets. This highlights a growing divide between airlines committed to SAF and those wary of its high cost and uncertain supply chain.</p>

          <p>Kilian Jornet, widely regarded as the greatest mountain athlete of all time, has completed his ambitious "States of Elevation" project, summiting the 73 highest peaks in the contiguous U.S. in just 31 days. The incredible endurance feat was entirely human-powered, with Jornet cycling more than 3,000 miles between mountain ranges before running up each peak. Jornet framed the journey not as a quest for records, but as an artistic expression to find and follow "the most aesthetic line" through the American wilderness.</p>

          <p>This article uncovers several fascinating and often controversial details from the history of the Nobel Prize. It highlights the remarkable Curie family dynasty, which amassed five prizes, and reveals that Albert Einstein promised his prize money to his ex-wife years before he won. The piece also examines historical oversights, such as the failure to recognize female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin for their crucial discoveries, and instances where prizes were awarded for scientific work that was later proven to be incorrect.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a staunch conservative and a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, is known for her hawkish security policies and her support for his "Abenomics" fiscal strategy. While her election marks a historic milestone for gender representation in Japanese politics, her conservative social stances, such as opposing same-sex marriage, have alienated some voters, particularly women.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is experiencing a significant rise in support among "Russia Germans," a demographic of ethnic Germans who resettled from the former Soviet Union. A recent study indicates that 31% of this group is prepared to vote for the AfD, a figure substantially higher than for other groups with migrant backgrounds. This trend is linked to the community's conservative views on citizenship and the AfD's Russia-friendly political stances, which resonate with voters who maintain cultural ties to their origins.</p>

The series also documented a pivotal era in English football, as the club prepared to move from its historic Roker Park to the modern Stadium of Light.</p>

          <p>A noticeable decline in the early sales of mooncakes for China's Mid-Autumn Festival is being interpreted as another indicator of weak domestic consumer demand. The exchange of these traditional pastries is often viewed as a bellwether for consumer confidence and spending on non-essential goods. Corporate gift-giving has also been curtailed, with one manager reporting that her firm's budget for employee mooncake gifts was slashed by 40% this year due to a sluggish business climate and recent staff layoffs.

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a program offering a $2,500 stipend to unaccompanied migrant children aged 14 and older if they agree to voluntarily return to their home countries. This payment is disbursed only after an immigration judge grants the request and the child has arrived back in their country of origin. The policy has drawn sharp criticism from rights advocates, who have labeled it a "cruel tactic" that could unduly pressure vulnerable minors into making life-altering decisions without fully understanding the risks involved.</p>

A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its perigee, the closest point in its elliptical orbit around Earth. This event will kick off a series of three consecutive supermoons, with additional occurrences expected in November and December, providing multiple opportunities to observe this impressive lunar phenomenon.</p>
