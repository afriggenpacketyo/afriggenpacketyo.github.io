          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international consensus on regulating artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need to balance development with security. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, he warned against AI becoming the exclusive domain of a few nations. This call for open access and global cooperation comes amid escalating tech competition with the United States, which has imposed restrictions on high-end chip exports to China. The premier's remarks highlight Beijing's push for a more inclusive approach to AI development and governance.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved their first win under head coach Sean Lynn, defeating Australia in a World Cup warm-up match in Brisbane. After a winless Six Nations campaign, the victory provides a significant morale boost ahead of the upcoming tournament. Despite an early Australian try and a weather delay for thunderstorms, Wales rallied with tries from Nel Metcalfe and Hannah Dallavalle. The Welsh defense successfully held off a dominant Australian side in the second half to secure the encouraging result.</p>

          <p>A pro-life group, 40 Days for Life, is celebrating the announced closure of two Planned Parenthood facilities in Houston, Texas, including what it described as the largest abortion clinic in the Western Hemisphere. The organization's CEO called the closures a "tremendous victory" for the pro-life movement, attributing it to grassroots efforts following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Planned Parenthood cited rising operational costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates for the decision. The closures occur amid ongoing political and legal battles over the organization's funding and operations in Republican-led states.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after their 2023 World Cup victory was marred by a sexism scandal involving the former federation president, Spain's women's football team is set to face England in the Euro 2025 final. The article details the team's journey of transformation, highlighting how the players have moved past the controversy to focus solely on their performance. Following a player boycott and subsequent promises of "profound changes" from the Spanish football federation, the team has shown remarkable unity and strength. Their path to the final represents a chance to celebrate a major achievement without the shadow of scandal.</p>

          <p>The anticipated recovery of the luxury goods market is encountering several obstacles, including unfavorable currency exchange rates and evolving consumer spending patterns. A significant drop in the Japanese yen, which previously boosted tourist spending, is now creating difficult year-over-year comparisons for brands like Richemont and Burberry. Conversely, many firms are reporting a surprising sales increase in the U.S., though it's unclear if this is due to consumers buying ahead of potential tariffs. Companies are also considering price hikes to offset costs, while performance varies significantly across product categories. (not investment advice)</p>

The outcome could potentially shift the legislative majority back to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which currently lacks control despite winning the presidency. The KMT has condemned the recall effort as political retaliation, while the elections have heightened tensions over Taiwan's democratic integrity and its relationship with Beijing.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Quant Hedge Funds Recruit Top Talent Amid US University and Visa Challenges</h2>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent, partly due to funding cuts and stricter visa policies at U.S. universities. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates who might have otherwise stayed in the U.S., fueling the sector's rapid growth. This influx of brainpower is crucial as these funds expand and increasingly leverage artificial intelligence in their investment strategies. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for talent, benefiting China's burgeoning financial technology industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen, Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia, have sent a formal letter to the attorneys for Jeffrey Epstein's estate, requesting an unredacted copy of a "birthday book" compiled for the late sex offender. The book reportedly contains messages from many powerful individuals, including a crude poem allegedly from Donald Trump, which he denies writing. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. This move intensifies the political pressure surrounding the Epstein case and the demands for greater transparency.</p>

The lawsuit accuses the funeral homes in Georgia and Pennsylvania of negligent mishandling of human remains and inflicting severe emotional distress.

          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's 'Robotaxi' Service Must Have Human Drivers</h2>

          <p>Despite Tesla's plans to expand its robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified that the company is not authorized to operate autonomous passenger vehicles on public roads. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that any service offered to the public, including a planned "friends and family" service in the Bay Area, must have a human driver in control. Tesla holds a charter-party carrier permit, similar to a limousine service, which requires a driver. This regulatory stance tempers the company's "robotaxi" branding in the state, reinforcing the distinction between its driver-assist features and true autonomous driving.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a dramatic dive shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers described a terrifying experience, with some being thrown from their seats as the plane rapidly lost altitude. The flight received alerts about a nearby Hawker Hunter jet, prompting the pilot's evasive maneuver. The plane continued to its destination and landed safely. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which marks another recent near-miss in U.S. airspace.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal prison in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month sentence for fraud and identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to a range of offenses, including faking his biography, defrauding donors, and using campaign funds for personal enrichment on luxury goods and Botox. His actions were described by prosecutors as making a "mockery of our election system." After his sentencing, Santos posted on social media imploring President Trump to give him a chance to prove he is more than his mistakes, an apparent plea for future clemency.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her long-running trademark battle with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell's attempt to re-register her business trademark, "nkd," was opposed by L'Oréal, which owns the "Naked" trademark for a line of its Urban Decay products. The French firm claims her brand name would cause consumer confusion, a claim Dowdeswell disputes, citing 15 years of trading without issue. After spending over £30,000 in legal fees, she feels ready to fight again now that a hearing date with the Intellectual Property Office has been set.</p>
