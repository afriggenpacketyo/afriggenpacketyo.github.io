          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in a "mass casualty event," with at least 27 fatalities, including nine children. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise in the middle of the night. Search and rescue operations are extensive, involving hundreds of first responders, helicopters, and drones, as they search for dozens of missing people, including about 23 children from a summer camp. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, promising unlimited state resources for the affected counties as the recovery effort continues.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos was seen yelling at a fan in the stands following the team's loss to the Cincinnati Reds. According to a witness, Castellanos was defending his teammate, second baseman Bryson Stott, who had made the final out of the game. The fan had reportedly "crossed multiple lines" while berating Stott, prompting the strong reaction from Castellanos. The incident highlights the tensions that can arise between players and fans, especially during moments of on-field frustration.</p>

His trip to Cuba was for international competitions and Olympic qualifiers, a standard part of his professional circuit. Despite efforts to secure an emergency visa, he ran out of time, highlighting how U.S. foreign policy can impact international athletes.</p>

          <p>A century after his death, Mark Twain's full autobiography has been published, following his explicit instructions for a 100-year embargo. The work was not written but dictated over four years, resulting in a sprawling, unconventional memoir that jumps between topics in a style reminiscent of a modern blog. Twain intended the long delay to free himself to speak candidly about his contemporaries, his family, and his own raw emotions without causing immediate hurt. This posthumous release was also a brilliant marketing strategy, ensuring his voice would be heard with renewed interest a full century later.</p>

          <p>As the death toll from the Texas floods rises, harrowing stories of survival and desperate pleas for help are emerging from the affected communities. One woman was rescued after being carried 12 miles down the raging Guadalupe River, while another family recounted how their fiancé died a hero saving his children. Families are using social media to circulate photos of missing loved ones, including numerous children and adults who were staying at campgrounds along the river when the floodwaters struck. These personal accounts highlight the immense human cost of the disaster beyond the official statistics.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email claiming President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the statement misleading and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, phased-out tax deduction for seniors. The communication is being condemned as a partisan and unconscionable use of a historically apolitical government agency to promote the president's agenda with inaccurate information.</p>

          <p>A focus group of voters who switched to the Labour Party in 2024 expressed a general sense of disappointment with the government's first year in power. Participants from two key constituencies in Kent cited a lack of progress on promises, particularly regarding immigration, and a feeling of being "lied to." While some were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of the situation, others were concerned by the government's frequent U-turns, which they felt showed a lack of direction. The discussion also revealed a growing interest in the Reform UK party as an alternative.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for Reform UK, has given up the party whip following newspaper allegations concerning his business dealings. The Sunday Times raised questions about whether two of his companies were eligible for the £70,000 in COVID-19 Bounce Back loans they received. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing but requested the suspension as a "precautionary measure" while the party conducts an internal investigation. He will now sit in the House of Commons as an independent, reducing Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent series of threats against political opponents, including Elon Musk and prospective NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, represents a significant escalation in his use of retributive rhetoric. The article analyzes how these warnings—ranging from deportation to arrest—serve to intimidate and chill free speech, regardless of whether they are legally executed. Pro-democracy campaigners warn that when the president threatens to use the power of the state against critics, the very notion of freedom is attacked. The pattern suggests a presidency increasingly defined by vengeance and an assault on constitutional norms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of eight men with serious criminal records to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden nation none of them are from. The men, who hail from countries including Cuba, Mexico, and Vietnam, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. Human rights advocates have condemned the move as "punitive and unconstitutional," expressing fears the men could face torture or other harm in a country the U.S. State Department warns Americans not to visit. The action marks an unprecedented expansion of the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to "tipflation" and widespread confusion for customers. Consumers are now prompted to tip in situations where it was not previously expected, such as at self-service kiosks or fast-food counters. The article explains that this trend, accelerated during the pandemic, is partly driven by the design of payment software, which makes tipping the default. Experts advise customers to understand local wage norms and not feel pressured by the technology, suggesting paying with cash as one way to regain control over gratuities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran may reinforce North Korea's belief that nuclear weapons are essential for regime survival, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang could interpret the U.S. actions as a sign that President Trump is an unpredictable and untrustworthy leader, making denuclearization an even more remote possibility. This could lead North Korea to further invest in making its nuclear arsenal more mobile and resilient to a first strike. The development complicates the already stalled diplomatic efforts regarding the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink made with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, has gone viral on TikTok with claims it can reduce stress. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that the beverage can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Doctors note that while the drink is likely harmless for most people and can aid hydration, its perceived benefits are more likely due to a placebo effect or the positive effects of its individual ingredients. They recommend proven stress-reduction methods like sleep and exercise instead.</p>
