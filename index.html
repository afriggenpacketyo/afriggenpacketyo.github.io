          <h2>Deadly Russian Strike Hits Kyiv as Peace Talks Stall</h2>

          <p>A massive Russian strike on Kyiv resulted in at least 12 fatalities and dozens of injuries, marking the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since July of the previous year, as peace talks appeared to stall. President Zelenskyy cut short his trip to South Africa in response to the attack, which he described as "one of (Russia's) most outrageous." The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones targeting Kyiv and other regions, while Russia claimed it targeted Ukraine's defense industry. EU officials condemned the attack, while Ukrainian officials asserted that Putin is not interested in peace efforts and only wants to continue the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his disapproval of the deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv, urging President Putin to halt the attacks, which resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries. Trump emphasized that he is applying pressure on both Ukraine and Russia to achieve a peace agreement, a key objective from his election campaign. Despite the criticism, Trump indicated he would wait a week to assess progress toward a deal, warning of potential consequences if the bombings persist. He reiterated his primary allegiance is to saving lives and indicated frustration with Putin's actions while President Zelenskyy called for the US to be more forceful with Russia to secure a ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of St. Louis are grappling with a legacy of nuclear waste contamination in Coldwater Creek, with many families experiencing a high incidence of cancer. Starting in 1942, uranium production for the Manhattan Project resulted in waste being dumped around the city, contaminating the creek that ran through residential areas. A 2019 study linked living near the creek to increased risks of lung, bone, and blood cancers. Residents are calling for a closer examination of the contamination and its health impacts, as many families have lost multiple members to cancer.</p>

          <p>A charity associated with Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, experienced a sudden $10 million increase in funding from a Medicaid contractor facing overbilling allegations. The funds were then funneled to two nonprofit political committees that supported Governor Ron DeSantis and his allies in defeating a ballot measure to legalize marijuana. This unusual transaction has triggered a growing scandal in Florida, prompting investigations by Republican state lawmakers and news reporters into the money trail and its connection to the governor's political objectives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prolonged trade war with China could result in retail shortages for U.S. consumers, particularly in apparel and footwear, as imports from China account for a significant portion of these goods. Tariffs could effectively act as import bans, leading to canceled orders and goods being held in warehouses. The risk of shortages depends on the duration of high tariff levels and the extent to which companies frontloaded inventory. Lower-end stores with lean inventories are expected to be hit hardest, with toys, games, budget home goods, and apparel disappearing first.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing back against a Politico report alleging discussions about lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets as part of a peace negotiation with Ukraine.

The Politico report cited anonymous sources claiming Witkoff was a main proponent of lifting sanctions, particularly on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

The merchandise includes hats and T-shirts, with descriptions suggesting a rewriting of the rules. The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits presidents to two terms, but Trump has hinted at methods to circumvent this restriction. Amending the Constitution to allow a third term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, as well as ratification by at least 38 states.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. government to take steps toward mining the ocean floor, a move opposed by most other nations who consider international waters off-limits.

The order aims to establish the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration and development, instructing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expedite permits for mining in both international and U.S. waters.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO) is ceasing its campaign of civil disobedience, citing tough new policing powers that have made it nearly impossible for such groups to operate. The group claims to have achieved its goal of influencing government policy on new oil and gas licenses. However, the end of JSO raises questions about the future of climate protest in the UK and whether being forced underground could lead to more disruptive or chaotic actions. While public concern about climate change remains high, JSO's disruptive tactics alienated many, prompting reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.</p>

Khalil's attorneys are seeking to terminate his deportation case based on the illegal arrest. Khalil, a Syrian-born legal U.S. resident, was arrested outside his apartment and was unable to witness the birth of his son. The administration has cited immigration fraud and adverse foreign policy consequences as reasons for his deportation, while civil rights groups accuse the government of targeting students for their political beliefs.</p>

          <p>Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said the thunderstorms were scattered and unpredictable because they’re associated with several smaller storm systems moving east rather than with a single big one.

Thunderstorm activity is expected to continue into Friday, but Mr. Chenard said the threats were expected to move east into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and portions of the Mid-Atlantic.</p>

President Trump, who just hours earlier had suggested that Ukraine’s president was the central impediment to peace, issued a rare public rebuke of Vladimir Putin: “Vladimir, STOP!” Trump wrote on his social media platform.</p>
