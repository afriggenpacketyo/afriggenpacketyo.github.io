          <h2>Trump Administration Moves to Rename Department of Defense as 'Department of War'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 23:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order allowing the Department of Defense to adopt "Department of War" as a secondary title, a move he believes will project a more powerful image of national readiness and resolve. This action, while not a permanent legal renaming without congressional approval, signifies a symbolic shift back to the department's pre-1947 designation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has already publicly endorsed the change, aligning with the administration's push for a more assertive military identity. The article contextualizes this by noting the original name was changed after World War Two to reflect a broader concept of national security beyond just warfare. This initiative underscores the president's desire to rebrand institutions and project a specific message, even if it entails significant logistical and symbolic implications.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett publicly defended her "surprisingly sharp comments" directed at Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent majority opinion concerning universal injunctions, stating her remarks were "warranted." Speaking at the Lincoln Center to promote her new book, Barrett clarified that she attacks ideas, not individuals, and holds "deepest respect" for Jackson, despite their fundamental disagreement on the scope of judicial power. The article highlights this rare public appearance as a glimpse into the court's internal dynamics, where such pointed exchanges are not uncommon. Barrett's explanation underscores the intense intellectual debates within the Supreme Court and her belief in robust judicial discourse, even when it involves stern critiques of colleagues' legal arguments.</p>

          <h2>Pentagon Considers Deploying Military Attorneys as Temporary Immigration Judges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 22:50:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Defense Department is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, a move requested by the Justice Department to address a backlog exceeding 3.4 million cases. This initiative follows the Trump administration's recent relaxation of job requirements for temporary immigration judges, allowing a broader pool of government lawyers to fill these roles. Critics, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association, express strong concerns that military lawyers, while skilled in their field, lack the specialized immigration law expertise needed for complex, "life and death" decisions. The article notes that this unprecedented plan is drawing scrutiny for potentially compromising due process and the integrity of the immigration court system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Lightcast reveals a significant surge in demand for AI skills across the job market, with employers willing to pay substantial premiums for these capabilities. Job postings requiring at least one AI skill advertised salaries 28% higher on average, escalating to 43% for those with two or more, representing a substantial annual increase. The article highlights that this demand is not confined to the tech industry, showing strong growth in non-tech sectors like marketing, sales, and customer support. Experts suggest that "AI literacy" is becoming essential for nearly every job function, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and preparation rather than fear regarding AI's impact on employment.</p>

Conversely, winners in high-tax states such as New York and Minnesota would receive considerably less after federal and state deductions.

          <p>This article critically examines President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," labeling it as political performance art designed to project a "tough guy" image. The author argues that the 1947 renaming to "Defense" by President Truman, a combat veteran, reflected a sophisticated post-World War II understanding of national security that encompassed more than just warfare. The article suggests that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's emphasis on "warfighters" and "lethality" disregards this crucial historical context and the modern global reality where even major adversaries use "Ministry of Defense" titles. This proposed change is viewed as inane and lacking genuine strategic insight.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction blocking the Trump administration's policy directive that sought to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports accurately reflecting their gender identities. This decision stems from President Trump's executive order, issued upon returning to office, which aimed to recognize only male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued the policy was arbitrary, unconstitutional, and rooted in "irrational prejudice." The article notes the appeals court concluded the government failed to meaningfully challenge the lower court's finding of "unconstitutional animus," marking a significant legal victory for LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>The attorney for Ed Hodgkiss, the recently fired Bishop Montgomery High football coach, released a statement alleging that unidentified school officials attempted to build a highly competitive team by recruiting transfer students. Hodgkiss, who also served as co-athletic director, was dismissed after five transfer students were declared ineligible for violating CIF bylaws, with a booster admitting to helping players move. The article notes the school subsequently forfeited its remaining football games and the principal resigned, indicating a significant scandal. The attorney maintains the transfers possessed "legitimate documentation" and were not "athletically motivated," suggesting a broader institutional strategy to circumvent rules.</p>

Leader Nigel Farage is identified as a powerful magnet for these discontented, socially-conservative, and climate-skeptic voters, many of whom previously supported Boris Johnson. This unprecedented fragmentation of the political landscape means Reform's current 31% support, historically insufficient for victory, could now secure a plurality of seats in the UK parliament.</p>
