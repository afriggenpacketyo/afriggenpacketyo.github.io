          <p>President Trump has invoked Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control for up to 30 days. This move, aimed at cracking down on crime despite data showing a decrease, has been called an "egregious assault on D.C. home rule" by local officials and Democrats. While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser stated the city will comply with the law, she and others argue it underscores the need for D.C. statehood, as Republicans have praised the action as a necessary step to restore order.</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Adidas has issued a public apology after facing accusations of cultural appropriation for a shoe design inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals. The design, from a U.S. designer, drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the governor of Oaxaca for using the heritage of the Villa Hidalgo Yalalag community without their involvement. The company and the designer both expressed regret, reaffirming a commitment to respectfully engage with the community's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the market's muted reaction to the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their AI chip sales to China. Investors appear to view the arrangement as a net positive, as securing access to the massive Chinese market is considered more valuable than being completely shut out by export controls. The ability to compete in China, even with a revenue haircut, is seen as preferable to ceding the entire market to local competitors like Huawei. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Thomas Siebel described the sales results as "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor performance to a disruptive internal reorganization and his own ongoing health issues. The company also reported a significantly wider operating loss compared to the previous year, and a search for a new CEO has been initiated. (not investment advice)</p>

The UN labeled the attack a grave breach of international law.

          <p>This opinion piece challenges the narrative that the Supreme Court is seeking to dismantle the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by hearing a case on racial gerrymandering. The author contends that a ruling against drawing congressional districts based on race would actually align with the Act's original, color-blind intent. The argument is that the law was designed to protect an individual's right to vote, not to create guaranteed safe seats for politicians of a particular race.</p>
