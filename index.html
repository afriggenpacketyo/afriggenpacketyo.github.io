        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation barring foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University for at least six months, citing the institution's untrustworthiness. Trump invoked the Immigration and Nationality Act, arguing that Harvard has failed to provide information about international students, has extensive foreign entanglements, and has discriminatory admissions practices. This action follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard‚Äôs Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which was blocked by a federal judge. Trump's proclamation also directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already studying at Harvard, reflecting ongoing tensions between the White House and the university. </p>

          <p>New Zealand's parliament voted to suspend three MƒÅori MPs for performing a haka during a parliamentary session last year in protest of a bill redefining the country's founding treaty with MƒÅori people. Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who initiated the haka, received a seven-day suspension, while co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer were suspended for 21 days. The MPs asserted they were being punished for being MƒÅori and unapologetically prioritizing their people's needs. Foreign Minister Winston Peters was criticized for calling Te PƒÅti MƒÅori a "bunch of extremists," sparking tense exchanges during the debate over penalties.</p>

          <p>The article explores the possibility of artificial intelligence developing consciousness and the ethical implications that would arise. While most AI experts remain skeptical, some researchers at Anthropic are investigating whether AI could become conscious and capable of suffering. Philosophers are also examining the risk of creating countless conscious AIs and the potential need to grant them legal rights. Experts are divided on how to test for consciousness in AI, with some focusing on behavior and others on the AI's architecture, raising complex questions about the nature of consciousness itself.</p>

In contrast, France and Ukraine are viewed as more reliable partners.

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether former President Joe Biden's administration conspired to cover up his mental state while in office. Biden responded by calling the investigation a "mere distraction" and defending his decision-making ability during his presidency. The White House statement specified that the investigation should focus on the circumstances surrounding Biden's execution of executive actions during his final years in office.

Jolly, who left the Republican Party in 2018, believes issues like affordability and public education will resonate with voters in 2026. He contrasts his stance with the current Republican leadership in Tallahassee, asserting they have gone too far in dividing the state. Jolly's decision mirrors past party conversions in Florida politics, and he faces challenges in a state where Republicans hold a significant registration advantage.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception. There are concerns that these medicines may harm unborn babies and reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, due to side effects such as vomiting and slowed stomach emptying. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking these GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward, recommending alternative methods like coils or implants for those on oral contraceptives. The warning comes amid growing concerns that many women are using these drugs unsafely without proper medical advice.</p>

          <p>With forecasts predicting an above-normal hurricane season, experts advise homeowners to review their insurance policies. It's crucial to ensure adequate coverage limits to rebuild a home, understand deductibles, and assess the need for flood insurance. Experts recommend checking policy limits against current construction costs and being aware of wind deductibles, which can be substantial. Given that standard homeowners' policies typically don't cover floods, a separate flood insurance policy is highly recommended, regardless of location.</p>

Researchers discovered that Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a second species of bacteria responsible for leprosy, was present in the Americas 1,000 years before European contact. The findings indicate that this bacterium had already spread throughout North and South America. The study, which involved analyzing DNA samples from ancient human remains, changes the understanding of the disease's history in the region.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has imposed record suspensions on three lawmakers who performed a Maori haka as a protest against a controversial bill. The bill, which has since been voted down, sought to rewrite a 185-year-old treaty between the British crown and Indigenous Maori leaders. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi were suspended for 21 days, while Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day suspension. Maipi-Clarke argued that the suspension was an attempt to silence Maori voices in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Recent fixes to long-standing problems at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are in jeopardy as the Trump administration slashes programs and cuts staff. Under the Biden administration, FEMA took steps to address the disproportionate impact of disasters on vulnerable populations. Now, some of those efforts have been canceled, while others face an uncertain future. The agency has cut billions of dollars of programs and lost hundreds of staff, raising concerns about equitable aid distribution after disasters.</p>
