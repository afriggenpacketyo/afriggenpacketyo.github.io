          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 3.5% amid volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months beat analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of shares to Sony Group shareholders. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster, tempering some of the positive market reaction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Riyadh, marking the first such meeting in 25 years after Trump announced the lifting of US sanctions on Syria. The meeting, encouraged by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signals a major shift for Syria after years of international isolation. Al-Sharaa became Syria's interim leader after leading rebels in an uprising that toppled Bashar Assad's government, though his past as an al-Qaida rebel has raised concerns, particularly from Israel.</p>

The analysis compiles polls from various respected pollsters, weighing their performance and sample sizes to provide a comprehensive overview. The data reveals that Reform's support has grown across all demographic groups, including younger voters, while Labour is slumping across generations.</p>

          <p>Robert F.

They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up, not a lifetime handout, and that current programs are failing to deliver self-sufficiency. Citing the success of the 1996 welfare reform, they propose that able-bodied adults work, participate in job training, or volunteer at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits, with limited exceptions for childcare and health issues. The officials believe this approach will prioritize the vulnerable, empower individuals, and protect taxpayers.</p>

Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit, secured a temporary injunction, with the Supreme Court considering the case.

Critics argue that the standards prescribe students to accept these so-called discrepancies as fact, rather than encouraging critical thinking.
