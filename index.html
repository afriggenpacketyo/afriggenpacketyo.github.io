          <p>Democrats in California are grappling with the issue of age and leadership, considering a proposal to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians. The debate has been fueled by concerns about leaders holding onto power beyond their prime, with examples like Senator Dianne Feinstein and President Joseph R. Biden cited. While some argue that age limits are discriminatory and disregard the value of experience, others believe they are necessary to make way for younger candidates with fresh perspectives. The proposal reflects a broader national conversation about generational change in politics.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located atop a volcano in Hawaii, has captured a detailed image of a cluster of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope that this instrument will enable them to better predict powerful and potentially damaging solar storms. Sunspots, described as areas of intense magnetic activity, can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The telescope's success marks a significant milestone in solar physics research.</p>

          <p>Reports have surfaced suggesting that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. questions the validity of germ theory, the scientific understanding that germs cause disease. Kennedy's views, outlined in his book, have raised concerns among medical experts about his ability to effectively lead the nation's health initiatives. His apparent skepticism towards germ theory has been linked to decisions such as gutting the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program. The implications of these beliefs are causing widespread alarm in the medical community.</p>

The BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service, cited the AfD's xenophobic stances and incompatibility with the country's democratic order as reasons for the designation.</p>

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule until 2030 without holding democratic elections, drawing criticism from the opposition. A national conference organized by the junta proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of permitted parties. Critics argue that these measures undermine democracy and violate the Malian constitution. The move has sparked concerns about a potential crackdown on political dissent, similar to actions taken by juntas in neighboring countries.</p>
