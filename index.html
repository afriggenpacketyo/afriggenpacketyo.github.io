          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Opinion polls indicate Lee holds a significant lead over his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Lee's eligibility was previously questioned due to election law charges, but the court postponed a ruling until after the election. Analysts predict that if elected, Lee will focus on reviving South Korea's economy and renegotiating trade agreements with the U.S., potentially seeking more favorable terms compared to other countries.

          <p>An independent review has found that the water sector in England and Wales is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted failures in government strategy, regulation, and water company management. Pressure on the sector is increasing due to climate change, population growth, and decades of underinvestment. Increased monitoring has revealed significant sewage spills into rivers, lakes, and seas, lasting over 3.6 million hours in both 2023 and 2024, and in April, bills rose by an average of 26% to fund upgrades.</p>

The job market also deteriorated, with employment shrinking at the fastest rate since January. Uncertainty in the external trade environment has increased, adding to domestic economic challenges, according to economists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The risk of a military accident in the Taiwan Strait is increasing as Beijing intensifies pressure on Taiwan, according to a former Taiwanese defense official. Andrew Yang Nien-dzu cited the lack of direct communication channels between the two sides as a significant concern. Yang highlighted the increase in "grey zone operations" by Beijing, including more frequent activities by its coastguard forces near Taiwan. The suspension of official communication between Beijing and Taipei since 2016 exacerbates the risk.</p>

          <p>Disney is implementing further layoffs, impacting hundreds of employees across its film, television, and finance departments, as part of ongoing cost-cutting efforts. These job cuts follow major layoffs in 2023, which saw approximately 7,000 workers let go as part of CEO Bob Iger's drive to save $5.5 billion. The entertainment giant faces pressure due to the shift of viewers from cable TV to streaming platforms. The company aims to efficiently manage its businesses while maintaining creativity and innovation, despite the industry's rapid transformation.</p>

          <h2>Column: Trump Prioritizes Loyalty Above All Else</h2>

          <p>A recent court ruling against Donald Trump's trade policies highlights his focus on loyalty above all else. Trump's response to the ruling, criticizing judges and the Federalist Society, reveals his belief that anything bad for him is illegitimate. The column argues that Trump's demand for servile loyalty extends beyond the executive branch, influencing appointments and legal interpretations. The author suggests that Trump's attack on the Federalist Society signals a shift in conservative principles towards prioritizing personal loyalty over legal principles.</p>
