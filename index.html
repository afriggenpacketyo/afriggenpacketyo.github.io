          <p>President Trump revoked the security clearances of numerous political opponents, including former Presidents Biden and Clinton.  This action is widely viewed as retaliatory and its practical impact is minimal, given that many individuals on the list no longer held active clearances.  Former officials largely dismissed the move as politically motivated.</p>

The author argues that this reflects a broader rollback of #MeToo gains.</p>
