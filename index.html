          <p>Elon Musk has threatened "immediate legal action" against Apple, alleging antitrust violations related to its App Store. He claims Apple is unfairly manipulating its rankings to disadvantage his AI company, xAI, and its Grok chatbot in favor of competitors like OpenAI. Musk questioned why his apps, X and Grok, are not featured in Apple's "Must Have" section despite their popularity. This escalation is part of an ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded and is now suing for abandoning its original non-profit mission.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a significant drop in vacancies and a decrease in the number of payrolled employees. According to the Office for National Statistics, job openings fell by 5.8% to 718,000 between May and July, a decline seen across almost all industries. The data suggests some companies are halting recruitment or not replacing departing staff, with the hospitality and retail sectors experiencing the sharpest payroll drops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of his planned peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They are urging him to ensure any potential deal respects Ukraine's sovereignty and allows the nation to "choose its own destiny." The appeal, signed by 26 of 27 EU leaders, reflects widespread fear that Trump might concede Ukrainian territory to Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces report minor territorial gains in the eastern Sumy region, recapturing two villages from Russian invaders.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a planned hike in mutual tariffs. The agreement keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. This extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances, unfair practices, and national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two economic giants have already been significantly impacted this year, with a notable decline in imports and exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level in over two years. Alongside the rate cut, the central bank downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker-than-expected public demand. The RBA noted that inflation has dropped substantially from its 2022 peak, bringing demand and supply closer to balance. The move comes amid a challenging global trade environment and softer-than-expected domestic economic performance in the first quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along Western Australia's coast have experienced their worst bleaching event ever recorded, following the region's most intense and prolonged marine heatwave. The damage spans 1,500 kilometers and affects previously resilient areas like the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef. This local event is part of a global coral bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures linked to climate change. Experts warn that reefs need 10 to 15 years to recover, but the increasing frequency of these events leaves them little time to bounce back.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's new memoir, "Frankly," offers candid reflections on her time in office. She expresses regret over the handling of transgender rights legislation, admitting she should have paused to build consensus, and describes the political fallout as losing "the dressing room." The book also delves into her fractured relationship with Alex Salmond, the emotional toll of leading during the COVID-19 pandemic, and personal challenges including a miscarriage and the end of her marriage. Sturgeon also addresses the police investigation into SNP finances, calling her arrest "the worst day" of her life.</p>

          <p>A woman's quick thinking was instrumental in solving the three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons in Scotland. Dr. Caroline Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can to mark the remote location where her new boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to burying a man he had killed in a hit-and-run. She then alerted the police, leading them to Parsons' body on the Auch Estate. McKellar and his twin brother had struck Parsons during a charity ride in 2017 and left him to die without seeking medical help before burying him.</p>

However, the same research shows very little sympathy among Jewish Israelis for the suffering of the Palestinian population, with 79% reporting they are not troubled by reports of famine. This divergence highlights a complex public sentiment focused on national concerns like hostage returns and soldier safety over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

          <p>Thousands of North Koreans are being sent to work in Russia under what they describe as "slave-like" conditions, filling a labor shortage caused by the war in Ukraine. According to interviews with escaped workers and intelligence officials, these laborers are forced to work over 18-hour days on construction sites with minimal safety and are confined to their work locations. Most of their earnings are confiscated by the North Korean state as "loyalty fees," a practice that violates UN sanctions. This arrangement provides a crucial source of revenue for Kim Jong Un's regime while supplying Moscow with cheap labor.</p>

          <p>Spain is taking a notably defiant stance against the Trump administration's foreign policy demands, creating tensions with the U.S. The Spanish government recently rejected purchasing U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets and has resisted committing to NATO's new 5% defense spending target. Simultaneously, Madrid is pursuing closer economic ties with Beijing, including awarding a contract to Huawei, further straining its relationship with Washington. Analysts suggest this approach makes Spain a rare European country openly antagonizing President Trump, a gamble that could be driven by domestic political pressures.</p>

Patients have reported severe pain and immobility after the implant slipped out of place, with hundreds requiring corrective surgery. Concerns were first flagged by the National Joint Registry in 2014, but the component was not withdrawn from the UK market until 2022.

The lawsuit, filed by California's governor, questions whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman stated the mission was to support federal law enforcement, but he surprised the judge by claiming troops could be sent even without an active threat.

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American fugitive who faked his own death and fled to Scotland to evade prosecution, is now on trial in Utah for a 2008 sexual assault. After a lengthy extradition battle where he posed as an Englishman named Arthur Knight, Rossi is facing the first of two separate cases. The court heard testimony from a woman who claims Rossi became controlling during their relationship before he held her down and sexually assaulted her. Rossi was apprehended in Glasgow in 2021 after being recognized from his tattoos while hospitalized for COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate developer and broker in Hawaii. The lawsuit alleges that Ohtani and Balelo used their celebrity leverage to have the plaintiffs fired from a $240 million luxury housing project they had conceived and brought Ohtani in to endorse. The plaintiffs claim Balelo made increasing demands before pressuring their business partner to remove them from the deal. The suit accuses the baseball star and his agent of tortious interference and unjust enrichment for their own financial self-interest.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub faces a wave of new competition from startups in the AI-powered coding assistant market. Under Dohmke's leadership, GitHub launched its popular Copilot tool, which now has 20 million users, but rivals like Cursor and Replit are gaining traction. Dohmke will stay on through the end of the year to manage the transition, with GitHub's leadership team set to report into Microsoft's broader CoreAI group.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The move comes after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report that showed a slowdown in hiring. Antoni has been a critic of the BLS's methodology and has defended Trump's economic policies. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is part of Trump's effort to install his own people to ensure economic data is, in his words, "HONEST and ACCURATE." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its less-developed regions, Nepal has made 97 of its Himalayan peaks free to climb for the next two years. The fee waiver applies to mountains in the remote Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent fee increase for summiting Mount Everest, which will now cost $15,000 during peak season. Officials hope the move will attract climbers to new destinations, creating jobs and strengthening local economies, although challenges related to infrastructure and access in these areas remain.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted control over Washington D.C.'s police force and deployed the National Guard to the capital, bypassing the city's elected government. Trump claimed the move was necessary to combat lawlessness and "rescue" the city, but critics argue his portrayal of crime is based on misleading claims. D.C. officials have condemned the action as an illegal power grab, while protesters gathered outside the White House. The president also warned that other Democrat-led cities could face similar federal intervention if they do not address crime.</p>
