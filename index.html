            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, North London, has ignited anger among locals, who viewed the tree as a symbol of comfort and historical significance. The Toby Carvery pub chain admitted to cutting down the tree due to health and safety concerns, claiming it was advised the tree was dead. However, residents dispute this assessment, stating the tree appeared healthy, and question the use of the felled wood. The incident has also raised broader concerns about the management of Whitewebbs Park, including the recent lease granted to Tottenham Hotspur for a training ground.</p>

            <p>Thousands of protesters gathered across the United States to demonstrate against President Trump's recent policies, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution. The protests, organized under the banner "50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement," addressed various grievances, including the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García and the administration's job cuts. Demonstrators carried signs referencing the revolution and expressing concerns about the economy and government efficiency. While most protests were peaceful, some confrontations were reported, and polls indicate a slight dip in Trump's approval ratings, particularly regarding his handling of the economy.</p>

            <p>The death toll in attacks in Benue state in central Nigeria has risen sharply to 56, with the governor blaming "suspected herdsmen." This violence is part of a larger pattern of intercommunal clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use, exacerbated by climate change and religious tensions. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to protect communities, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges of insecurity and resource conflict in Nigeria's Middle Belt.</p>

A BBC documentary, Growing Up Gypsy, highlights the experiences of three young Romany women navigating everyday life and the pressure they face to hide their identity. Prejudice against the GRT (Gypsy, Roma and Traveller) community remains widespread, with polls suggesting a significant percentage of people would be uncomfortable employing a Gypsy or traveller.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, pending further review. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that the men were being deported without due process or a chance to argue their case in court. The White House responded by claiming the men were "foreign terrorists." The ruling follows earlier legal challenges to the administration's use of the wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants, some of whom have been sent to a high-security prison in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas, attracting both excitement and concern from local residents. The development, subsidized by government incentives, will house headquarters for X, The Boring Company, and SpaceX. While some welcome the job opportunities and economic growth, others worry about the impact on the area's rural character and rising housing prices. The project highlights the broader trend of tech companies moving to Texas, drawn by lower costs and favorable regulations, but also raises questions about environmental impact and community integration.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by the January wildfires are suing major California insurance companies, including State Farm, alleging collusion to force homeowners into the California FAIR Plan. The lawsuit claims insurers conspired to eliminate competition, leaving homeowners underinsured with the FAIR Plan, which has higher premiums and lower coverage limits. The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed due to insurers canceling coverage in fire-risk zones, leading to potential financial strain for homeowners statewide. The plaintiffs are seeking three times the damages they have sustained.</p>

            <p>A woman in Spain, Lina, was assessed as being at "medium" risk by the VioGén algorithm after reporting threats from her ex-partner, but was later killed by him. Her case raises questions about the effectiveness of algorithm-based risk assessment tools in protecting women from domestic violence. Critics suggest police may be relying too heavily on the algorithm's assessment, while Spain's interior ministry has restricted access to VioGén's data, hindering independent audits. The case highlights the potential for algorithmic bias and the need for careful evaluation of such systems.</p>
