          <h2>Startup Founders Discuss Overcoming Business Failures and Identity Loss</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the challenging journeys of startup founders who experienced business failures and the subsequent struggle with identity. Serial entrepreneur Ismael Dainehine and others share insights on learning from setbacks and redefining success beyond purely financial metrics. The piece also examines the "entrepreneurship penalty," where former business owners face discrimination when returning to corporate roles, despite possessing valuable skills like multitasking and time management. Ultimately, it emphasizes the importance of developing a deep sense of purpose and mission to build resilience and reframe perceived failures as opportunities for growth and clarity.</p>

          <p>South Korea faces a severe demographic crisis with its birth rate at a record low of 0.748, significantly below the 2.1 replacement rate needed for population stability. This trend threatens to push the nation into a prolonged economic downturn by the 2040s, impacting productivity, the workforce, and the pension system. Despite over $270 billion spent on incentives to boost childbirth, efforts have had minimal effect on reversing the decline. While some analysts caution against despair, suggesting technological innovation, immigration policies, and human adaptability could mitigate the impact, the challenge remains substantial for the "Miracle on the Han River" economy.</p>

          <p>China is actively relaxing its visa-free entry rules to attract more foreign visitors and boost its tourism sector, simplifying a process previously known for extensive paperwork and fees. This article outlines five methods for travelers to enter mainland China without a visa, including transit stays of up to 10 days for passport holders from 55 nations, such as the US and several European countries. Recent updates also allow Russian citizens to stay for up to 30 days visa-free, effective September 15. These strategic changes aim to make China more accessible and stimulate its economy.</p>

          <p>The US State Department revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa, citing his "reckless and incendiary actions" during a pro-Palestinian protest in New York. Petro had urged US soldiers to disobey orders and called for an army larger than the United States'. This incident follows his strong rebuke of the Trump administration at the UN General Assembly and calls for a criminal inquiry into US strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats, which he claimed killed unarmed young people. The action further strains relations between the historical allies, which have significantly soured under Colombia's first leftist leader.</p>

          <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Atlanta has unveiled a new in-house lab to expedite the processing of federal drug seizures in Georgia, significantly improving efficiency by reducing testing time from days to minutes. This enhanced capability is proving crucial in the intensified fight against the violent "Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG)," as evidenced by a recent seizure of over 1,000 pounds of meth linked to the cartel.

          <p>Hungary is experiencing increasingly aggressive political discourse, marked by widespread government-funded propaganda and personal attacks against critics. A recent protest in Budapest, organized by the Loupe Theater Troupe, drew thousands against hate speech and for free public spaces, warning of the "neurotoxin of propaganda." Critics accuse Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party of dehumanizing opponents and dominating traditional and digital media, with 85% of political ads on Facebook spent on behalf of the government. This situation has led to a significant drop in Hungary's press freedom index ranking, with little improvement expected before the 2026 election, foreshadowing a "loud, aggressive, and brutal time."</p>

          <p>Sweeping UN economic and military sanctions are set to be reimposed on Iran, a decade after their lifting under a landmark nuclear deal, following accusations by the UK, France, and Germany that Iran failed to fulfill its commitments. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the move as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," insisting his country would not seek a nuclear bomb but demanding reassurances against attacks on its nuclear facilities. The re-imposition includes an arms embargo and bans on uranium enrichment and ballistic missile activity, further straining an already fraught international situation and raising concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is aggressively pursuing retribution against perceived enemies, raising significant concerns about the expansion of presidential authority and the rule of law. Actions include vocally encouraging the attorney general to target political opponents, suggesting revoking TV licenses for biased media, and indicting former FBI Director James Comey. Critics argue these moves are norm-shattering and push the US towards authoritarianism, drawing comparisons to 1930s Germany and citing studies on democratic backsliding. Supporters, however, view them as necessary to combat a "deep state" and perceived injustices, framing them as justified turnabout for previous administrations' actions.</p>

NPR, which has managed the system for decades, alleges CPB's sudden decision to exclude it reflects bending to the Trump administration's will, violating constitutional protections for free speech.

She believes a time-limited exchange scheme for 18-to-30-year-olds, without a right to remain, would significantly benefit the economy, growth, and businesses. Reeves also urged the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the scheme's potential economic impact into its upcoming forecasts, hoping to reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises. The proposal has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement post-Brexit.</p>

While unlikely given Humberto's current dominance, such an interaction could slightly alter their forecasted paths. Forecasters expect Humberto to strengthen further, and the second system, likely to become Tropical Storm Imelda, is tracking towards the Bahamas, raising concerns for storm surge, wind, and rainfall in the southeastern US early next week.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her highly anticipated film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced reading it as a teenager. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film promises a heightened, gothic, and provocative approach, as hinted by its erotically charged trailer. Fennell, known for "Saltburn," described the novel as "difficult, complicated, and so sexy," and chose Robbie for her "otherworldly power" akin to Catherine Earnshaw. Despite taking liberties with her adaptation, she emphasized retaining much of Brontë's original, powerful dialogue. The film is set for release on Valentine's Day next year.</p>

          <p>Michele Beckwith, acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento, claims she was fired after warning Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino that agents could not conduct indiscriminate immigration raids in California's Eastern District due to a court injunction. Beckwith, a career prosecutor, emphasized compliance with court orders and the Constitution. Her termination followed a phone call and email to Bovino, after which her work access was revoked. Days later, Bovino's agents conducted a raid in Sacramento, asserting their operations would continue unabated. This incident highlights ongoing tensions between the Trump administration's immigration policies and the legal system, with concerns about upholding civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A California man, Varun Suresh, faces a murder charge after allegedly conducting a targeted, vigilante-style killing of a registered sexual offender. Police responded to an altercation and found 71-year-old David Brimmer fatally stabbed. Suresh reportedly researched registered sexual offenders using Megan’s Law website and lured Brimmer out by posing as a CPA. Brimmer had been convicted in 1995 of committing lewd and lascivious acts with a child. Suresh allegedly told police the killing was "really fun" and he "didn't feel sad at all," having waited years to kill a sexual offender due to the pain they cause children.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue its freeze of over $4 billion in foreign aid, overriding a lower court's ruling. The conservative-majority court stated that the "asserted harms" to Trump's foreign affairs conduct outweighed potential harm to aid recipients, though this is not a final determination. Liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over spending. This move aligns with the Trump administration's policy to drastically downsize foreign aid, with critics warning of dire consequences for global public health and developing countries.

These developments signal how US trade restrictions, imposed since 2019 over national security concerns, have inadvertently spurred innovation within China's domestic AI industry.

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent Trump ally, defamed election technology company Smartmatic with false claims of rigged 2020 election machines. The judge found 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely alleged Smartmatic interfered with results, but deferred the question of "actual malice" required for damages. Smartmatic seeks "nine-figure damages," while Lindell, who maintains an "unwavering belief" in the truthfulness of his statements, vowed to continue his fight against voting machines. This ruling follows other legal setbacks for Lindell, including a $2.3 million defamation award to a former Dominion employee.</p>

Rights activists worry about the human cost, citing alleged civilian killings and blurred lines between rebels and ordinary citizens. Despite government claims of success, the use of local recruits in security units, reminiscent of a previously disbanded unconstitutional force, draws criticism.
