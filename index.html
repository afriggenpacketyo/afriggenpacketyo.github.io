          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally Kisean Paul Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for orchestrating a $1 million fraud scheme. Kingston and his mother leveraged his fame to acquire luxury goods, such as a bulletproof Escalade and high-end watches, without payment by using fraudulent wire receipts. Despite his apology in court, the judge ordered him into immediate custody. The scheme involved duping sellers between April 2023 and March 2024 by promising social media promotion in exchange for goods he never intended to pay for, leading to his arrest after a SWAT raid on his Florida mansion.</p>

          <p>As the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin commenced in Alaska, the event was marked by a flyover of a B-2 stealth bomber and F-35 fighter jets, interpreted as a show of U.S. military strength. The meeting, focused on the Ukraine war, proceeded without Ukrainian President Zelensky. In a notable political development, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated she would nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he could secure a just end to the conflict without Ukraine conceding territory. Trump responded positively to Clinton's conditional offer, adding a layer of domestic political intrigue to the high-stakes international negotiations.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The summit, hastily arranged at a strategic U.S. military base, aims to broker a ceasefire, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not in attendance. Trump has been pushing for a resolution, even setting a deadline for Putin to agree to terms or face new sanctions. The discussions are expected to cover complex issues like territorial disputes, with reports suggesting a potential deal could involve Russia retaining control of Crimea and the Donbas region.</p>

          <p>A tech analyst has described potential U.S. government intervention in chipmaker Intel as "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson stated that such a move is necessary to revitalize Intel and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The administration is reportedly considering using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the deal. The discussion highlights growing concerns about technological sovereignty, particularly with the rise of superintelligent AI, which some compare to nuclear proliferation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite topping third-quarter estimates, the weak guidance led Bank of America to downgrade the stock, noting that the slowdown could persist and may be specific to the company's current challenges.

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a block on the Trump administration's plan to conduct mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, the court ruled that a lower court did not have the jurisdiction to halt the layoffs, which could affect 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees. The ruling, which will not take immediate effect to allow for an appeal, is a significant development in the administration's efforts to reshape the consumer watchdog agency. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, condemned the decision as a lawless attempt to dismantle an agency that has returned over $21 billion to consumers.</p>

The rising costs are a significant source of stress for many American families. In response, caregivers are switching to store brands and seeking cheaper meal options.

However, the vehicle's affordability is being challenged by the Trump administration's rollback of federal EV tax credits, which could raise its effective price from below $20,000 to nearly $28,000.

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on federal corruption charges following a multi-year investigation. The indictment follows previous charges against a local businessman who allegedly provided gifts to the mayor in exchange for favorable treatment. Cantrell also faced scrutiny over an alleged affair with her police bodyguard, who was charged as a co-defendant in the new indictment. Cantrell is the first mayor in the city's history to be federally charged while still in office. Her second term is set to end in January 2026, and she is term-limited from running for re-election.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit to challenge President Trump's executive order placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The lawsuit calls the move an "unlawful" and "hostile takeover" that infringes on the district's right to self-governance. The city is seeking a temporary restraining order to pause the directive, which installed the head of the DEA as the new chief of the D.C. police. The Trump administration invoked emergency powers under the Home Rule Act to justify the action, citing high crime rates, a claim that D.C. officials dispute with recent data showing a decline.</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Drake as "groundless and indeed ridiculous." Drake is suing the company, which is the parent label for both him and Kendrick Lamar, alleging defamation and that UMG secretly promoted Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us" to the detriment of his own career. In a court declaration, Grainge stated that the accusation makes no sense given UMG's investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in Drake's career and music rights. UMG's legal team further argued that the lawsuit's premise—that Drake could only lose a rap battle due to a corporate conspiracy—is absurd.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from writer-director Zach Cregger, is being praised as a "feel-bad, feel-good movie of the year" for its compelling and conclusive storytelling. The movie centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class and successfully avoids the common pitfall of leaving its central mystery unanswered. The article explores how the film provides a satisfying resolution by revealing the supernatural villain behind the events, leading to a cathartic and violent comeuppance. However, the review also notes that the film smartly underlines that vanquishing evil doesn't erase the trauma it caused, leaving the audience with a complex mix of triumph and sorrow.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced an investigation into Meta following a report that the company's internal guidelines permitted AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. The probe will examine whether Meta's AI products enable child exploitation and if the company misled the public about its safeguards. A Reuters report cited an internal document allowing a chatbot to describe an eight-year-old as a "masterpiece." In response, a Meta spokesperson stated the examples were "erroneous and inconsistent with our policies" and have since been removed, emphasizing that their rules prohibit sexualizing children.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that the tax breaks from President Trump's recent legislation will vary significantly by state, with residents in places like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts seeing the largest average savings. The report estimates an average individual tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, though this figure changes over time as certain provisions expire. The analysis also found that some of the largest average tax cuts at the county level are in wealthy resort towns. Conversely, a Congressional Budget Office report suggests the legislation could hurt lower-income households due to cuts in social programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force reveals his claims about crime are misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024. Data from D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department shows a 26% reduction in violent crime from August 2024 to August 2025. This downward trend aligns with national FBI statistics showing a decrease in violent crime across the U.S., a fact omitted from Trump's statements about an "out of control" crisis.</p>

While the labor market has shown worrisome signs with sluggish job creation, consumer spending has remained surprisingly resilient, raising hopes that a recession can be avoided. President Trump's policies, including tariffs, have fueled concerns about "stagflation"—stagnant growth combined with rising prices. Recent data showed an uptick in wholesale prices, suggesting inflation could accelerate, yet retail spending also increased.

          <p>This article serves as an appreciation and introduction to the Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, prompted by a review of a new biography about her. The writer delves into Spark's best-known work, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," exploring its themes of mentorship, adolescence, and moral education. The novella focuses on a group of schoolgirls in 1930s Edinburgh and their charismatic but manipulative teacher. The analysis highlights Spark's use of an omniscient narrative and her central concern with faith, as the main character's journey culminates in a Catholic conversion, reflecting Spark's own life and providing a complex resolution to her teacher's influence.</p>
