          <p>Germany's coalition government has agreed to create a National Security Council (NSR) to improve its ability to respond decisively to crises, a move spurred by events like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The new council, chaired by the chancellor, will consolidate information from various ministries to enable faster, more coordinated security and defense policy decisions. While it will not have unilateral decision-making power like its U.S. counterpart, the NSR aims to end political gridlock that has previously hampered Germany's role in European security. The body is expected to begin its work in October, replacing the existing Federal Security Council.</p>

          <p>A meeting in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded without a formal agreement to end the war in Ukraine. Trump described the three-hour discussion as "extremely productive," while Putin suggested Russia is interested in ending the "tragedy." However, no specific steps towards a ceasefire were announced, with Trump stating it is now up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reach an agreement with Moscow. Putin framed the conflict as a matter of Russian security, a narrative that observers worry Trump may adopt, leaving the path to peace uncertain.</p>

Simpson had a distinguished playing career, participating in 62 Test matches between 1957 and 1978, and was renowned for his batting, leg-spin bowling, and slip fielding. After retiring, he made a notable comeback as captain at age 41 during the World Series Cricket era. As a coach starting in 1986, he is credited with transforming the Australian team, leading them to a 1987 World Cup victory and laying the groundwork for a generation of dominance.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have expressed concerns about the sustainability of the United States' expanding national debt, fueling calls within China to reduce its holdings of U.S. dollar assets. While not at risk of default, the continuous growth of U.S. debt is seen as a long-term risk. In response, China has been gradually trimming its U.S. Treasury holdings, which are currently at their lowest level since 2009. The researchers suggest that China should continue this trend and diversify its reserves by increasing holdings of gold and other strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have triggered devastating flash floods and landslides across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of at least 307 people. The majority of fatalities occurred in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where numerous homes were damaged and a rescue helicopter crashed, killing its five crew members. Authorities have declared disaster zones in several areas as forecasters predict the heavy rainfall will continue. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events in the region to climate change, which has made the annual monsoon season more dangerous.</p>

          <p>A passenger train collision with a slurry tanker has resulted in at least one death and 27 injuries in southern Denmark, near the German border. The crash, which occurred at a level crossing between Tinglev and Kliplev, caused at least two carriages to derail, with one flipping onto its side. Authorities confirmed a 60-year-old woman died in the accident, and of the five people seriously injured, two remain in critical condition. The train was carrying 106 people, including a group of schoolchildren who were not seriously harmed. Rail services on the line have been suspended indefinitely pending investigation.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial engine test for its new-generation Long March-10 rocket, a significant step toward its goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test involved simultaneously firing seven YF-100K engines, which will form the core stage of the superheavy launcher, confirming they can operate in sync under various power conditions. The Long March-10 is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload into a trans-lunar orbit. China's lunar landing plan involves two separate launches of this rocket: one for the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and another for the Lanyue lander.</p>

          <p>The high-profile summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a ceasefire agreement for Ukraine, yet it marked a significant moment in international diplomacy. A key outcome was Putin's re-emergence on the world stage, receiving a red-carpet welcome on U.S. soil after years of being shunned by Western leaders. During their brief public statements, Putin emphasized addressing the "root causes" of the conflict, suggesting his maximalist demands remain, while Trump was notably vague and did not mention Ukraine directly. The meeting, which ended with an invitation for Trump to visit Moscow, raised more questions than it answered about the future of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is implementing stricter residency regulations for mainland Chinese nationals, a policy described by critics as an "attack" on cross-strait spouses. The new rules, championed by President Lai Ching-te, are part of a strategy to counter perceived threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration. Under the proposed amendment, applicants must provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. This policy marks a significant shift in cross-strait governance, reflecting the Lai administration's intent to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that it believes could pose a national security risk to the island.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, a move aimed at gaining up to five U.S. House seats. This effort is a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting plan in Texas and is intended to help Democrats win control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. The proposed maps create oddly shaped districts designed to maximize the Democratic voter advantage, potentially nearly eliminating Republican representation from the state's congressional delegation.</p>
