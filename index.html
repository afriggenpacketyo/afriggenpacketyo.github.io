          <p>A Polish CEO, Piotr Szczerek, has issued a public apology after a video showed him snatching a hat intended for a young boy from tennis player Kamil Majchrzak at the US Open. Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed the hat was being passed to him but acknowledged his actions hurt the child and disappointed fans. The incident gained widespread attention on social media, prompting criticism of his behavior. The tennis player later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise, resolving the situation amicably.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has stated he would "declare a republic in arms" if his country were attacked by U.S. forces deployed in the Caribbean. The U.S. has increased its naval presence as part of a counter-narcotics operation, which Maduro has labeled as the "greatest threat" in a century and an attempt at regime change. In response, Venezuela has mobilized troops along its coast and border, escalating tensions in the region. The U.S. has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel but has not made any public threats of an invasion.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, public broadcasting stations across the United States are facing significant financial challenges. Many PBS and NPR affiliates have launched emergency fundraising drives and are seeing strong community support, but job losses and programming cuts have already begun. Stations in rural and less affluent areas are particularly vulnerable, prompting national networks to reduce dues and philanthropic efforts to organize support. The crisis is forcing stations to explore new collaborative models to ensure their survival and continued service to their communities.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas after a jet ski he was riding collided with another vessel in the waters off Paradise Island. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that the man was found unresponsive with visible injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments made by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about drawing up "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine. Pistorius called the public discussion of such plans "completely wrong" before any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have occurred. He emphasized that the EU lacks the jurisdiction for troop deployments and urged caution. The remarks highlight differing views within Europe on the nature and timing of post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine amid the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has cautioned that his team cannot simply "rinse and repeat" their successful 2023 strategy for the upcoming event at Bethpage in the U.S. Despite retaining 11 of the 12 players from the victorious Rome team, Donald emphasized that playing away from home presents a different challenge that requires a new approach. He acknowledged the continuity is beneficial but stated that player profiles change over two years and that pairings will be adapted accordingly. Europe has not won a Ryder Cup on American soil since 2012.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to criticize a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which requires school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some schools. In her new story, Atwood ironically describes two perfect children who grow up and have a family without ever having sex. Her piece directly targets the provincial government's policy, which she and other critics argue is an overreach that censors important literary works.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study has found that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, have caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated animals. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones discovered that while wild species like foxes and deer have shrunk due to habitat loss and hunting, domesticated animals such as sheep and chickens have grown larger through selective breeding. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact of human influence on the natural world, altering evolutionary paths that had previously moved in similar cycles for millennia.</p>
