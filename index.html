          <p>The Trump administration's cancellation of a Biden-era humanitarian parole program has led to the termination of numerous immigrant workers at an Amazon warehouse in Indianapolis. These employees, primarily from Haiti, had been working legally in the U.S. under the program's protections. The dismissals have created significant financial and personal uncertainty for the affected families, who now face potential deportation despite ongoing asylum cases. Amazon stated it is complying with the law and providing resources to impacted staff.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, is pushing back against accusations of antisemitism and connections to a known Holocaust denier. In an interview, the 30-year-old nominee called the claims a "total lie" and highlighted his support for the Jewish community. Several Jewish leaders, initially cited by media as not supporting him, have since clarified their endorsement or stated he is an ally. Ingrassia is now awaiting his Senate confirmation hearing where he will likely face further questioning.</p>

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was active in far-right extremist groups, a fact he learned from the security service a few weeks ago. Forssell stated he will not resign, explaining that his son is deeply remorseful and has since cut all ties with the groups. The revelation has prompted accusations of double standards against the government, which collaborates with a radical anti-immigration party. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has expressed his continued confidence in the minister.</p>

          <p>Joe Root demonstrated exceptional skill and grit, finishing the day unbeaten on 99 as England reached 251-4 against India in the third Test at Lord's. On a challenging, slow pitch, England had to adopt a more cautious approach, battling India's disciplined bowling attack. After losing two early wickets and two more after tea, Root anchored the innings, first with Ollie Pope and then with captain Ben Stokes. His performance has put England in a stable position heading into the second day of the match.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's remarks praising Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article details six key facts about Liberia's unique relationship with the United States. Founded in 1822 by freed American slaves, English is its official language, and its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe. The country's flag, culture, and institutions bear a strong resemblance to American counterparts. The piece provides context for why many Liberians speak with an American accent, a point Trump may have noticed without understanding its historical origins.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. The judge certified a class-action lawsuit and issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the deprivation of U.S. citizenship constitutes irreparable harm. The order challenges the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.

          <p>This article delves into the origins and evolution of the term "middlebrow," tracing it back to early 20th-century literary debates, particularly involving Virginia Woolf. Woolf famously derided the middlebrow as a dishonest consumer of art, lacking the conviction of either the "highbrow" intellectual or the "lowbrow" populist. The essay explores how this pejorative term has since softened to describe pedestrian tastes, from popular music to department stores. It reflects on how the battle of cultural tastes was shaped by mass communication and continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about art and consumption.</p>

          <p>Many people who suffer from migraines find their symptoms worsen during the summer, and a neurologist explains the potential factors. Weather-related changes, such as intense sun and shifts between outdoor heat and indoor air conditioning, can act as triggers. Other contributing factors include dehydration and changes in routine, such as sleep patterns or alcohol consumption during summer activities. To help prevent attacks, experts recommend staying well-hydrated, wearing sunglasses to block bright light, getting adequate rest, and using fragrance-free summer products like sunscreen.</p>

The court has been seen to expand presidential authority while simultaneously limiting the power of lower courts to issue broad injunctions against executive actions. This shift has been facilitated by the court's increasing use of its "shadow docket" for consequential decisions without full hearings. The trend suggests a fundamental challenge to the established constitutional order and the system of checks and balances.</p>

The company reported a 6.2% growth in total company sales, with U.S. core comparable sales rising 5.5%. While traffic growth slowed slightly, it was offset by an increase in the average transaction size. Cramer expressed confidence in the company's business model and its ability to keep prices low for members, suggesting the stock's current level presents a good buying opportunity.

          <p>Nearly a year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, six Secret Service agents have been suspended without pay for their roles in the security failure. The suspensions range from 10 to 42 days. The incident, where a shooter killed a firefighter and grazed Trump, exposed significant operational lapses, as detailed in subsequent congressional reports. The Secret Service's deputy director stated the agency would not "fire our way out of this" but would focus on fixing the deficiencies that led to the preventable attack.</p>

While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. CDs, conversely, offer a fixed rate for their entire term, providing guaranteed returns. A calculation shows that for 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, a CD currently offers slightly higher, guaranteed earnings than a money market account, making it a more profitable choice for savers who can lock away their funds.

          <p>Despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations and meetings between Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump, the war in Gaza continues with intense Israeli military operations. A recent airstrike in central Gaza reportedly killed 15 civilians, including ten children, who were waiting outside a health clinic run by the U.S. charity Project HOPE. The charity condemned the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law. The Israeli military stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" and that it was investigating the incident and regretted any harm to civilians.</p>

The piece suggests the nomination is a distraction tactic, designed to prevent U.S. pressure for a ceasefire and to avoid accountability for his government's security failures. It critiques the move as a way to manipulate the U.S. president while continuing a brutal military campaign.</p>

The law aims to increase transparency for consumers, effectively treating meat produced under such conditions like a vice product with a warning label.

          <p>This article analyzes the phenomenon of intense fandom surrounding grocery store chains like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B. It argues that in an era of declining traditional affiliations, consumer behavior has taken the place of religion or politics as a primary way people form communities and signal their identity. These stores cultivate loyalty by reflecting their shoppers' values, whether regional pride, health consciousness, or cultural heritage. An anthropologist suggests this "tribalism" is a powerful social driver, turning a utilitarian space into a cornerstone of personal and community identity.</p>
