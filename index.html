          <p>Russian forces launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine, specifically targeting the northeastern Kharkiv region and the southern Odesa region, escalating tensions in the ongoing conflict. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan visited Ukraine after discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, signaling continued diplomatic efforts. Keith Kellogg, a US envoy to Ukraine under President Trump, stated that the United States does not consider Ukraine a NATO member and acknowledged Russia's concerns regarding NATO's eastward expansion. This statement adds a layer of complexity to the geopolitical dynamics surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>Influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate have been charged in Britain with sexual assault and other crimes, following an investigation dating back to 2012. The charges, authorized last year, include sexual assault, actual bodily harm, human trafficking, and controlling prostitution for gain. The brothers, who have denied all allegations, were previously arrested in Romania on charges of participating in a criminal ring that allegedly sexually exploited women. They briefly returned to the U.S. before going back to Romania, and Romanian courts have ordered their extradition to the U.K. once their case there concludes.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to increase rice exports to counter a projected long-term decline in domestic consumption, according to the annual white paper on food and agriculture for fiscal 2024. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is recommending exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. Target markets include China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and the government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030. This strategy is part of a broader effort to reach record agricultural exports, but the government is also introducing measures to curb soaring domestic prices, driven in part by shortages.</p>

Representatives for Fernandes have reportedly met with Al-Hilal officials to discuss a potential move that would allow him to participate in the Club World Cup. While Fernandes has remained focused and continues to fulfill his captain responsibilities, he has not guaranteed his future with Manchester United, suggesting he may be ready to leave. Despite coach Ruben Amorim's desire for Fernandes to stay, a potential Â£80m transfer fee could help reshape the squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece challenges Mark Twain's assertion that travel diminishes prejudice, arguing that despite record levels of global tourism, bigotry and narrow-mindedness persist. The author contends that events like ruinous wars, rising nationalism, and opposition to immigration indicate that international travel has not fostered peace and cooperation as expected. Furthermore, the piece suggests that many tourists are not effective ambassadors against prejudice, as they often remain within exclusive resorts and fail to engage with the realities of local communities. The author cites Donald Trump's trade policies as evidence that international trade has also failed to inoculate against bigotry.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Germany experienced twice as many days of extreme heat due to climate change. The analysis, covering May 1, 2024, to May 1, 2025, found that almost half of the world's population experienced at least an extra 30 days of extreme heat because of human-induced climate change. Germany had 50 days of extreme heat, with 24 of those days attributed directly to climate change. The report highlights that 2024 was the hottest year on record, and January 2025 was the hottest January on record, underscoring the urgent need to address greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>Several Alpine communities in Switzerland's LÃ¶tschental valley are preparing for potential evacuation following a significant landslide caused by the collapse of the Birch Glacier. The collapse sent millions of cubic meters of ice, mud, and rock into the valley, blocking the River Lonza and causing water levels to rise. Authorities are concerned that the blocked river could dislodge the mass and impact downstream communities, prompting the municipalities of Steg-Hohtenn and Gampel-Bratsch to issue evacuation alerts. A 64-year-old man remains missing after the collapse, and the army is on standby to assist with cleanup operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This attack followed a ruling by a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, that deemed most of Trump's tariffs illegal. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming they provided poor advice on judicial nominations and alleging they were influenced by Leo. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts and considering it a privilege to have been involved. The president's criticism marks a striking departure from their long-standing alliance, during which Leo advised Trump on his Supreme Court picks.</p>

          <p>The article highlights seven lesser-known facts about Elon Musk, ranging from his early days as a child video game creator to his role as an inspiration for Iron Man. At age 12, Musk created a video game called Blastar, and later, he co-founded Zip2, which sold for $300 million. Musk also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and was the original founder of X.com, which later became PayPal. His life and personality inspired Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark, and while he didn't start Tesla, he propelled it onto the global stage. Musk's ultimate goal is to create an "everything app" similar to WeChat.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, overcoming a shocking moment of overconfidence. After finishing as runner-up last year, Faizan was the favorite but nearly jeopardized his chances by prematurely attempting to spell "commelina" without asking clarifying questions. Despite the error, he recovered and correctly spelled the winning word, "eclaircissement." Faizan's joyful and enthusiastic approach to spelling, in contrast to more traditional, stoic spellers, made him a memorable champion, despite his near-miss. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.</p>

          <p>A New York court ruling that deemed President Trump's blanket import taxes illegal has limited impact on the UK-US trade deal. The tariffs in question do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement is yet to be implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for British exporters.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in locking away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. Saltmarshes, which have been significantly reduced due to agriculture, are recognized as important "sinks" for carbon dioxide. The charity is advocating for these tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Research conducted on Hesketh Out Marsh revealed that plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter, underscoring the importance of preserving and restoring these ecosystems.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the 1955 deportation of Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, by the United States, arguing that it proved to be a major misstep.

The author draws parallels to the current targeting of foreign students and researchers, cautioning against repeating historical mistakes fueled by xenophobia. The deportation of Qian is presented as a cautionary tale of how shortsighted policies can have long-term, detrimental consequences on global power dynamics.</p>
