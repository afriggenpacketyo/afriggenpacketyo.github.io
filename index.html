          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 14:10:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut, demand for mortgage refinancing has surged among homeowners, particularly those who purchased homes after 2022 with higher rates. A good refinance rate is subjective, but current averages are around 5.87% for a 15-year and 6.51% for a 30-year fixed loan. The article suggests that even a half-percentage point reduction can be beneficial for some, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points can help secure even lower rates. Homeowners are advised to assess their personal financial situation to determine if refinancing is the right move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of data center company Applied Digital jumped 16% after it reported first-quarter revenue of $64.2 million, significantly exceeding analysts' expectations and marking an 84% increase from the previous year. This growth is largely attributed to high demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, highlighted by an expanded multi-billion dollar lease agreement with CoreWeave. Despite a net loss for the quarter, the company is moving forward with major expansion projects in North Dakota, positioning itself to capitalize on the booming AI industry.

          <p>A Trump administration immigration official testified in federal court regarding plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year. The official revealed that the U.S. has been in discussions with several countries, including Eswatini and Ghana, about accepting Abrego Garcia, though no agreement has been finalized. This testimony is part of a hearing concerning the legality of his prolonged detention, as his lawyers argue it violates a Supreme Court precedent against indefinite confinement while awaiting removal.</p>

          <p>The price of silver has risen dramatically in 2025, increasing by 76% year-to-date to over $50 per troy ounce, significantly outpacing its value in recent years. This surge has made it an attractive, lower-cost alternative to gold for investors seeking to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. The article suggests that current economic conditions, including inflation and geopolitical instability, could lead to further price increases, making it a potentially timely investment. Experts recommend that precious metals should not exceed 10% of a portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the tenth day of the U.S. government shutdown, the Trump administration has begun laying off federal workers through a process known as "Reductions in Force" (RIFs). The White House budget chief, Russell Vought, confirmed the layoffs have started and are substantial, with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services issuing notices. This move, which permanently terminates employment rather than furloughing workers, is viewed as a tactic to pressure Democrats to approve a funding deal and end the shutdown.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics will bring back furloughed staff to complete and release September's consumer price index (CPI) report, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The decision was made because the Social Security Administration requires the third-quarter inflation data to calculate its annual cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries by a November 1 deadline. While this key economic report will be published, other important data releases, such as the nonfarm payroll report, remain delayed due to the lapse in federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, an organization affiliated with Columbia University, has secured a major legal victory against the Trump administration's policies on student speech. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian students were unconstitutional and designed to chill free speech. This defiant stance contrasts sharply with Columbia University's own more conciliatory approach to the administration, which has included settling antisemitism claims and restricting campus protests, creating a widening gap between the institute and its host university.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing law that overrides local zoning regulations to permit denser and taller residential buildings near public transit hubs. The bill, which affects eight counties including Los Angeles, is one of the state's most ambitious efforts to address its severe housing crisis by streamlining construction. While celebrated by housing advocates as a transformative step, the law faced opposition from some cities that argued for the importance of local control over development.</p>

          <p>The IRS has announced its annual inflation adjustments for the 2026 tax year, which will affect several tax provisions for families.

Additionally, the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit is set at $1,700, while the maximum credit for adoption expenses will increase to $17,670.

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the updated federal income tax brackets and standard deduction amounts for the 2026 tax year. These annual adjustments account for inflation, preventing "bracket creep" where taxpayers are pushed into higher tax brackets due to cost-of-living wage increases rather than a real increase in purchasing power. For 2026, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly will rise to $32,200, while single taxpayers will have a standard deduction of $16,100, providing some relief for filers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current rate climate, a $200,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) would have an approximate monthly payment between $1,893 and $2,410, based on average interest rates of around 7.84%. These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago due to falling interest rates. A HELOC's variable rate means payments can change, but with the Federal Reserve in a rate-cutting cycle, costs are anticipated to decline further, making it an increasingly affordable borrowing option for homeowners.
