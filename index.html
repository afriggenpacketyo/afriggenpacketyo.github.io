        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on two charges: making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice. The indictment stems from his September 2020 testimony regarding whether he authorized the leak of classified information to the media, a claim Comey denies. This legal action follows President Trump's public calls for investigations into his political adversaries, with the probe led by a former Trump personal lawyer. Comey maintains his innocence and expressed confidence in the judicial system, facing up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contrasts China's long-term strategic planning, exemplified by its five-year plans and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), with the United States' more reactive economic approach. China's system involves extensive consultation and proactive growth strategies, evolving from Soviet-style targets to consumer-led rebalancing. Conversely, the article argues that the US, favoring market forces, struggles with effective planning due to political polarization, hindering its ability to guide the economy through coordinated monetary and fiscal policies.</p>

          <p>An independent review by McChrystal Group revealed that Los Angeles County's response to deadly January wildfires, which killed over 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes, was hampered by critical resource shortages and outdated emergency alert policies. The report highlighted issues like sheriff's deputy vacancies, an under-resourced Office of Emergency Management, and unreliable communication systems. Evacuation warnings were delayed, sometimes arriving after houses had already burned, impacting vulnerable populations. While first responders were praised for heroism, the report underscores the need for clearer policies, better training, and integrated tools to improve public safety.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Marcos and outgoing Chinese envoy Huang Xilian have emphasized that South China Sea disputes should not define the broader relationship between their nations. During Huang's farewell, Marcos called for continued deepening of trade, people-to-people interactions, and cultural exchanges. The Chinese embassy echoed this sentiment, hoping the Philippines would work towards normalizing relations. This language mirrors previous joint statements aimed at de-escalating maritime tensions and fostering cooperation despite ongoing disagreements in the contested region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly irritated by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's public interventions, which are perceived as challenging the government's direction. Starmer plans to address centre-left leaders globally, arguing for "patriotic renewal" against "predatory grievance" politics, specifically targeting the rise of Reform UK.

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced new punitive tariffs effective October 1, targeting a range of imported goods. These include a 100% tariff on branded pharmaceutical drugs (unless manufacturing plants are built in the US), 50% on kitchen cabinets, 30% on upholstered furniture, and 25% on heavy-duty trucks. Trump justified these measures as necessary for national security and to protect US manufacturers from "flooding" by foreign products.

          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, diminishing earlier speculation of a takeover by rivals like Shell or Exxon Mobil.

This marks an unprecedented legal action against a former FBI director, occurring just before the five-year statute of limitations expired.

Spanning 2,890 meters, it will also be the world's longest mountain bridge, crossing the incredibly deep and narrow "Earth's crack" gorge. This engineering marvel further solidifies Guizhou's reputation, already home to nearly half of the world's 100 tallest bridges.</p>

          <p>Former Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy Arcadio Rodriguez pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor charges, including sexual battery, involving two female inmates, but will serve no jail time. He received 364 days of home confinement (time served) and must register as a sex offender for at least 10 years. The District Attorney criticized California law for limiting charges to misdemeanors for over-the-clothes sexual assault, advocating for harsher penalties. Rodriguez was accused of touching inmates and showing them pornographic videos at Theo Lacy maximum security jail.</p>

          <p>A satirical 12-foot statue depicting President Trump holding hands with Jeffrey Epstein, titled "Best Friends Forever," was removed from the National Mall by the National Park Service (NPS) due to a permit height discrepancy. The anonymous activist group "Secret Handshake" behind the installation claims the NPS failed to provide the required 24-hour notice for removal and subsequently denied a second permit application without explanation. The incident has sparked debate about free speech and political satire, with the group's representative suggesting the denial came from a "very high place."</p>

          <p>The CDC has issued a warning about a dramatic 460% surge in NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE) bacterial infections in the US between 2019 and 2023. These "superbug" bacteria are resistant to strong antibiotics, making them extremely difficult to treat and leading to severe complications or death. The rise is partly associated with antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts advise judicious antibiotic use and good hygiene to protect against these infections, which are not historically common in the US and pose a significant public health threat.</p>

          <p>The indictment of James Comey is presented not merely as political retribution but as a test of President Trump's broader strategy to weaponize the justice system against opponents and undermine democratic processes. The article links the indictment to Trump's stated intentions to prosecute those funding anti-Trump causes and his administration's investigations into liberal donors. It suggests this action, alongside other measures like deploying troops in Washington D.C., is part of a forward-looking plot to shred the rule of law, protect Trump's self-enrichment, and influence future elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a memorandum to establish a comprehensive strategy against "domestic terrorism," prompting fears among critics that it could be used to crack down on political opponents, particularly left-wing groups. Trump suggested targeting funders like George Soros and Reid Hoffman, despite no known evidence linking them to political violence. Civil liberties groups, like the ACLU, condemned the move as a dangerous attempt to stigmatize non-profits and activists, warning that it could expand investigations into protected activities under the guise of combating terrorism.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is facing questions regarding the role of tech investor Harriet Green in its "Department of Government Efficiency" (Doge) initiative, aimed at cutting costs at councils controlled by the party. Green, whose firm invests in companies that work with or compete against local government, is proposed to access sensitive council data at West Northamptonshire. Local councillors have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and unfair advantages for businesses backed by her firm. Legal constraints have hampered Doge's data access so far, making Green's role a potential model for future operations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. The settlement will compensate authors approximately $3,000 per covered book and does not apply to future works. While a previous ruling found AI training on copyrighted books wasn't illegal, Anthropic was found to have wrongfully acquired materials from pirate websites. This agreement is seen as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for intellectual property infringement.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has declared he will not allow Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, stating "It's not going to happen." This comes amid increasing global pressure on Israel to end the Gaza war and occupation, with many Western states recognizing an independent Palestinian state. Trump also indicated progress on a Gaza deal, saying they are "pretty close." Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, barred by the US from attending the UN in person, thanked countries for recognizing Palestine and called for a Palestinian state to assume full responsibilities for Gaza.</p>

          <p>A California Senate Bill, inspired by an 8-month-old baby woken by loud commercials, aims to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. Federal law already governs traditional TV ad volume, but streaming platforms are exempt. Due to California's market influence, if Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill, it could effectively set a nationwide standard, forcing streaming companies to control ad loudness. The Motion Picture Association opposes the bill, citing complexities in managing diverse ad sources, but proponents argue the industry can adapt.</p>
