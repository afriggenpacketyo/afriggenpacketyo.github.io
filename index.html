          <p>Mark Zuckerberg introduced the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, featuring a digital display, hand gesture control via a neural wristband, and AI capabilities. These glasses bridge Meta's existing audio-only smart glasses and experimental AR technology, allowing users to watch videos and respond to messages. Meta also launched Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes and the second generation of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, alongside Horizon TV for Quest VR headsets. This marks a significant step in Meta's wearable technology development.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Oscar Piastri confirmed that he and teammate Lando Norris are "very aligned" on their approach to the Formula 1 title fight, following discussions after the Italian Grand Prix. Piastri, who leads Norris by 31 points, was asked to cede second place in Italy due to an unusual pit-stop strategy that disadvantaged Norris. The team aims to maintain internal cohesion, keeping specific racing protocols private to avoid becoming targets. McLaren could secure the constructors' championship early in Baku.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are set to conclude their case in the federal trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club. Testimony focused on a storage box containing phones, ammunition, and Routh's "Dear World" letter, which stated his assassination intent and offered money for the act. Routh, representing himself, argued for the full letter's inclusion to provide context, claiming it referenced shredding an airplane, not a golf course assassination. Associates also testified about Routh's statements and the discovery of the box.</p>

          <p>Residents of Whiting, Indiana, are suffering from the environmental impact of the BP Whiting Refinery, the Midwest's largest fuel processor. A severe August thunderstorm caused flooding, shutting down the refinery and leading to oil and gas fumes in homes and visible hydrocarbon sheens in Lake Michigan. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about the facility's safety record, including past fires, power outages, and a gas pipeline leak. Environmental groups criticize BP's lack of investment in infrastructure upgrades and the broader rollback of environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>Many adults lose touch with their childhood creativity due to mounting responsibilities and a focus on productivity, but experts say this imaginative side can be rediscovered. To foster creativity, individuals should tap into past interests and find activities they genuinely enjoy, making them more likely to stick with new habits. Keeping pursuits low-pressure, without focusing on outcomes or technical proficiency, helps build confidence and enjoyment. Sharing creations without monetizing them can also prevent hobbies from becoming stressful, allowing for true creative exploration.</p>

          <p>US tariffs imposed by President Trump on Brazilian and Mexican imports are unexpectedly leading to lower food prices in those countries. In Brazil, a survey showed food prices fell in 24 of 27 state capitals, with coffee and meat becoming cheaper due to increased domestic supply.

          <p>A Utah court filing refuted the popular theory that Charlie Kirk's alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, was a right-winger, instead indicating his drift to the political left. This article explores why many, particularly on the left, believed the initial theory, attributing it to motivated reasoning and the rarity of lethal left-wing political violence in modern America. Historically, left-wing violence was more common in the 1960s-70s, but recent decades have seen it primarily associated with property crime, contrasting with right-wing and jihadist violence.</p>

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio stars in Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," a political satire, black comedy, and action blockbuster 20 years in the making. DiCaprio describes the film as holding a mirror to society's growing polarization and divisiveness, with an "interesting undercurrent about extremism," presented without being overtly preachy. The article highlights the film's ability to find humanity in its flawed characters and its warm reception from critics, who praised its timely themes and strong performances from DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion worth of US investment, expected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major tech firms like Microsoft and Google are among those pledging billions. This initiative aims to deepen US-UK economic ties, though some sectors, like pharmaceuticals, have recently halted investment due to a challenging business environment in the UK. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Trump will discuss these economic deals at Chequers, with the vast majority of the investment coming from Blackstone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes the lack of positive outcomes from President Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin, arguing it failed to end the war in Ukraine and instead emboldened Russian aggression. The author highlights recent Russian attacks in Ukraine and incursions into NATO airspace, contrasting Trump's passive response with his "president of peace" claims. The article suggests Trump's foreign policy approach, including his stance on Israel, has led to a "bystander phase" in his presidency, drawing international and domestic criticism for his perceived impotence.</p>

          <p>The National Immigration Administration reported 15.89 million visa-free entries by foreign nationals into China from January to August, accounting for roughly two-thirds of international arrivals. A significant driver of this growth is the reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia, implemented on July 17th, which has already resulted in 150,000 visa-free trips by Malaysian passport holders. Russia is also anticipated to become a major source of visa-free visitors, indicating a strategic effort by China to boost international tourism and engagement.</p>

While Robinson's initial messages were playful, later ones explicitly stated his involvement. The FBI is investigating numerous Discord users, though the platform denies evidence of planning on its site. Lawmakers are now pushing for aggressive social media regulations, with some calling for the repeal of Section 230, which grants platforms immunity from user content.</p>

Families of those who died are proposed $1.5 million for pain and suffering, with additional funds for dependents and a $5 million direct claim premium. The program, designed to expedite recovery and avoid lengthy litigation, will hold community meetings for public input, though private lawyers urge caution regarding potential lower payouts compared to lawsuits.</p>
