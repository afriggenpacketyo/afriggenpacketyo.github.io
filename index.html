          <p>The Lakers are undergoing an ownership change as the Buss family sells its majority stake to Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and TWG Global. This move is seen as a positive development for the team's future, as Walter's leadership has brought success to the Dodgers, including consistent playoff appearances and multiple World Series wins. While the Buss family's legacy is celebrated, the organization has lacked a sustained championship vision in recent years. Walter is expected to invest heavily in the Lakers' infrastructure, coaching staff, and player acquisitions. The change signals a shift towards a more data-driven and forward-thinking approach to team management.</p>

          <p>An expert has warned that 3D-printed guns could become the weapon of choice for criminals and violent extremists, as these untraceable firearms are increasingly found in criminal cases. The BBC investigated the online spread of 3D-printed guns on platforms like Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram, finding advertisements and how-to guides. A Telegram account claimed to ship weapons globally, offering a Liberator or a Glock switch. While social media platforms claim to remove such content, loopholes remain, allowing dealers to operate. Models like the FGC-9 can be assembled using 3D-printed plastic and repurposed metal components, making it easier for individuals to create their own firearms.</p>

Herzog stated that Israel shared intelligence with the U.S. before attacking Iran, indicating Iran's plans to produce a nuclear weapon. While Israel has not explicitly requested U.S. military involvement, Herzog suggested intervention from other nations would be welcome. He also suggested that weakening Iran's regime could lead to its collapse and potentially resolve the conflict in Gaza. However, some analysts warn that U.S. intervention could escalate the conflict and destabilize the region.</p>

The film explores the challenges faced by survivors in a post-apocalyptic world, including the relationship between adults and children born after the outbreak. Comer discussed the emotional complexities of her character, Isla, and the challenges of portraying someone deep into post-apocalyptic living.

          <p>Leading climate scientists warn that the Earth could breach the 1.5C warming limit in as little as three years at current carbon dioxide emission levels. A study estimates that the "carbon budget" has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes, meaning the world has roughly three years until that budget is exhausted. The current rate of warming is about 0.27C per decade, much faster than anything in the geological record. Scientists estimate that human-caused warming reached 1.36C above pre-industrial levels last year. The rate of global sea-level rise has doubled since the 1990s, raising the risks of flooding for millions of people living in coastal areas worldwide.</p>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) in England due to their high cost and limited benefits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that the drugs were not a cost-effective use of taxpayers' money. The drugs slow the progression of Alzheimer's but do not reverse or stop the disease. The official price in the US is £20,000-£25,000 per patient per year, and the potential cost to the NHS would be around £1.5bn a year. NICE acknowledged the news would be disappointing but said the benefits were "modest" at best.</p>
