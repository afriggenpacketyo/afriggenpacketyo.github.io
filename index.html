            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Van Hollen shared a photo of the meeting on social media and spoke with Abrego Garcia's wife. Despite court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, the Trump administration has alleged he is a gang member, a claim disputed in court. The White House criticized Van Hollen's trip, while El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele mocked concerns over Abrego Garcia's well-being, stating he would remain in El Salvador's custody.</p>

Trump stated he was confident of reaching a fair deal, while Meloni aimed to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amidst trade tensions. Meloni also criticized "woke ideology" and championed the "war against illegal migration" aligning herself with Trump's viewpoints. Despite Trump's past criticisms of the EU on trade, Meloni secured an invitation for Trump to visit Rome, potentially facilitating meetings with other European leaders.</p>

            <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was indicted in Manhattan federal court on charges including stalking, firearms offense, and murder. Attorney General Pamela Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in Mangione's case, marking the first time the federal death penalty has been sought since the Biden administration placed a moratorium on federal executions in 2021. Mangione's attorney criticized the decision as political and barbaric, going against the recommendation of local federal prosecutors.

            <p>The leaders of Canada's major federal parties debated key issues like trade relations with the US, affordability, and the environment, with US President Donald Trump looming large. Liberal leader Mark Carney defended himself against criticisms related to his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, while addressing Trump's tariffs with a focus on targeted retaliation. The debate also featured discussions on housing, crime, and immigration, highlighting starkly different policy visions among the parties. Smaller parties fought for airtime, emphasizing their role as checks on the dominant Liberal and Conservative parties.</p>

            <p>The global economy is facing increasing instability due to trade wars and policy changes initiated by the US administration. While remarks about annexing Canada or Greenland were dismissed as rhetoric, the Trump administration's tariffs have introduced volatility into global markets and weakened trade foundations. The lack of a clear international response is concerning, with the world seemingly hesitant due to fear or a lack of options. While tariffs may be intended to pressure countries into resolving trade imbalances, they ultimately impose costs on consumers and disrupt supply chains.</p>

            <p>A wind project is stalled in New York due to federal opposition. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has ordered a halt to an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.

President Trump, a longtime critic of wind energy, issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. This disrupts a much-needed electricity supply to a region with growing power demands for things like data centers.</p>

            <p>A pilot project called SeaCURE has started operating on England's south coast, testing the feasibility of removing carbon from the sea. The project processes seawater to remove carbon, then pumps the water back into the sea to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. While current removal is small, proponents believe it has potential if scaled up and powered by renewable energy. The project has £3m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.</p>

            <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating he should be cutting interest rates and that his "termination cannot come fast enough." Trump's comments followed Powell's warning about the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war. Trump has introduced tariffs that economists say could reignite inflation. Trump nominated Powell to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly planning to enact the president’s demand, a move that would cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. The move is part on an ongoing battle, and a significant escalation on Trump’s attack on Harvard and his aggressive, multi-pronged assault on higher education institutions.</p>

            <p>Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations. On the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>The CDC has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools due to potential layoffs of staff working on the outbreak response. The CDC had considered expanding onsite assessments to schools, but agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems. The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters or fungal outbreaks.</p>

            <p>A strike among bin workers in Birmingham has left piles of waste around the city. At the heart of the dispute is the removal of the role of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO), who were paid more than some other bin workers. The council now wants to cut the crews to three by getting rid of the role of the WRCOs. Unite claims that the scrapping of the WRCO role will leave some workers having to accept pay cuts of up to £8,000. The council says that the figures are "incorrect" and "no-one will lose £8,000 per annum".</p>

            <p>China-founded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein say they plan to raise prices for US customers starting next week, a ripple effect from US President Donald Trump’s attempts to correct the trade imbalance between the world’s two largest economies by imposing a sky-high tariff on goods shipped from China. Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein , which is now based in Singapore , said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs”. The 145 per cent tariff Trump slapped on most products made in China , coupled with his decision to end a customs exemption that allows goods worth less than US$800 to come into the US duty-free, has dented the business models of the two platforms.</p>
