          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 22:57:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The agencies will collaborate with food companies to voluntarily remove these dyes to meet consumer demand. This initiative follows a previous move to ban Red No. 3 and is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies, though the International Association of Color Manufacturers has expressed concerns about the timeline, citing potential supply disruptions. The FDA is also looking to authorize four new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has reduced its 2025 GDP projections for China, India, and Japan, citing trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Global growth forecasts were also lowered due to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners, considered a major negative shock. This forecast aligns with a wider trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies due to the escalating U.S.-China trade war. While Japan and India have adopted a more conciliatory stance towards the U.S., trade relations remain strained.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government measures will grant police chiefs the authority to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to boost public confidence in policing. The reforms, prompted by an independent report following the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer, make passing vetting checks a legal requirement for all serving officers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has called the reforms essential to restore confidence in policing. These changes address concerns about officers remaining in their positions on full pay despite failing vetting checks and aim to ensure that only officers of the highest standards wear the uniform.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing him. Trump expressed his desire for Powell to be more proactive in cutting interest rates, although the Fed has not cut rates this year after lowering them last year. These remarks come after concerns that pressure on Powell could lead to rising prices amidst existing trade tariffs, which have already caused uncertainty in the global economy. The International Monetary Fund downgraded the U.S. economic growth forecast for this year due to the tariff-related uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms and gas distributors may need to renegotiate long-term LNG procurement contracts with US providers due to the ongoing US-China trade war. Trade flows of US LNG to China have halted since February due to tariffs, now at least 140 percent. Chinese buyers hold 21 long-term procurement contracts with US producers, but the vast majority of the LNG expected to be delivered this year could be resold to other markets. The situation mirrors the 2018-19 trade war, with expectations of suspended US LNG imports and contracting activities as long as tariffs remain.</p>

          <p>Guangdong province in China stands out for its higher birth rate amidst a national decline, attributed to cultural traditions in regions like Chaoshan where lineage and larger families are prized. While China faces an aging population, Guangdong recorded over a million births in 2024, leading the nation for new births for the seventh consecutive year. The province's birth rate remains among the highest in the country, contrasting with the reluctance of youth elsewhere to have children. The cultural emphasis on ancestral halls and family names in Chaoshan contributes to this trend.</p>
