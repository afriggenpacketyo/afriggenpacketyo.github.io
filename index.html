          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. In this role, he will directly challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. The changes, which affect about half a dozen senior positions, are intended to renew the party's policy focus and present a unified front against the Labour government. This move comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership as the party struggles in the polls following a poor showing in recent local elections.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man from Essex, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for what he believed were Russian intelligence agents. Phillips offered to provide personal information about former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he thought were Russian spies, who were actually undercover British officers. Prosecutors stated that his application for a job with the UK Border Force was part of his plan to assist Russia. Phillips, who his ex-wife said was "infatuated" with espionage, will be sentenced at a later date.</p>

          <p>The Lake County Coroner’s Office in Illinois has corrected initial reports regarding the death of 37-year-old Megan Bos, whose body was found at the home of an undocumented immigrant. Contrary to claims, the coroner stated that Bos was not decapitated, and the autopsy found no signs of trauma, though her body was in an advanced state of decomposition. The cause of death remains undetermined, with toxicology revealing fentanyl, cocaine, and morphine, making both a drug-related death or homicide possible. The suspect, initially released, has since been re-arrested by immigration authorities amid public outrage.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. However, the company reported a 1% decline in global unit case volume, with North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific markets all seeing a drop in demand. To adapt to consumer preferences, the company also revealed plans to launch a version of its classic cola made with cane sugar in the U.S. this fall. The company has narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast, reflecting ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Renters across the UK are experiencing significant financial pressure, with the average monthly rent for new tenancies having increased by £221 over the past three years, according to property portal Zoopla. The article highlights personal stories of individuals struggling to afford housing, with some forced to turn down job opportunities or rely on parental support. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, costs remain prohibitively high for many. This situation is making homeownership feel unattainable for a generation of renters, even as house price growth has stagnated.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are discussing a potential collaboration to develop a spaceport for suborbital flights, a move that could dramatically reduce travel times. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, such technology could shorten the journey between Taipei and Houston to as little as two and a half hours, compared to the current 14.5 hours. The partnership would focus on this emerging form of space transport, where a vehicle briefly leaves the Earth's atmosphere before landing. This technology, still in the experimental phase, is being explored for tourism and high-speed cargo delivery.</p>

This comes after overdose deaths in the U.S. saw their first decline in 2023, a success many attribute to programs like OD2A.

An investigation cited in the suit used genetic analysis and found that 90% of tested restaurants were misleading customers.

He warns that any new deal would likely see Israel withdraw from most areas captured in Gaza, with Hamas benefiting from increased aid and fuel deliveries. Ofer concludes that Hamas's strategy of blending with the civilian population has been effective, creating military pressure and a narrative of suffering that strengthens its leverage.</p>

          <p>The Harvard Education Publishing Group has abruptly canceled a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review that was dedicated to "education and Palestine." The issue, which was nearly ready for publication, included articles on the destruction of Gaza's schools and the challenges of teaching about the conflict in the U.S. The publisher cited a "lack of internal alignment" and an inadequate review process, but authors and editors allege it is an act of censorship driven by fear of legal and political backlash. The move is seen as a significant example of the "Palestine exception" to academic freedom amid a climate of repression on U.S. campuses.</p>

          <p>Kensington Palace has released a new photograph of Prince George to celebrate his 12th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Josh Shinner in Norfolk, shows the smiling prince in a rural setting. A message from his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied the photo on social media. As second in line to the throne, Prince George's life involves public appearances, such as attending Wimbledon and Trooping the Colour, alongside his family's efforts to provide a relatively normal childhood at their home on the Windsor estate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has unveiled a plan to rewrite or repeal over 60 workplace regulations, which it describes as "obsolete." The proposed changes would affect a wide range of rules, including minimum wage requirements for home health care workers, safety standards for construction and mining, and protections for migrant farmworkers. The Trump administration states the goal is to reduce burdensome rules and promote economic growth through deregulation. However, critics and labor advocates argue the proposals would weaken worker protections and put employees at a greater risk of injury or death.</p>

          <p>Thousands of properties downstream from aging dams in the U.S. Midwest are at increasing risk of flooding due to more frequent extreme weather events. The article highlights the century-old Huffman dam in Ohio, part of a system protecting Dayton, which is in need of an estimated $140 million in repairs. This infrastructure crisis is unfolding as the Trump administration rolls back federal investments in dam safety and flood mitigation. Experts warn that without significant upgrades, many of the nation's 92,000 dams, a majority of which are decades old, are unprepared for the "100-year" floods that are now occurring with greater regularity.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its next-generation high-speed rail technology, which successfully surpassed the previous operational speed barrier of 350km/h (217mph). Researchers overcame the challenge of significantly increased aerodynamic resistance at higher speeds by redesigning the train's head shape and adding an undercarriage cover. These innovations, inspired by fast-flying birds, reduced air resistance by over 24% in total. The result is a train that can travel 50km/h faster while maintaining a similar energy consumption level to the current CR400 Fuxing models.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent period of close cooperation during strikes on Iran, the relationship between the Trump and Netanyahu administrations is showing renewed signs of friction, particularly over Israel's latest actions in Syria. Israel launched airstrikes against Syrian forces in the Sweida province, an intervention that complicates the Trump administration's efforts to normalize relations with Syria's new government. U.S. officials have reportedly expressed frustration, with one calling the Israeli strikes "poorly timed." This divergence highlights a recurring tension between Israel's strategy of periodic strikes against regional adversaries and the U.S. administration's stated goal of reducing its military footprint in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Supporters of rival Los Angeles soccer teams, LAFC and the Galaxy, set aside their intense rivalry to show solidarity against federal immigration raids. During a recent match, LAFC fans unfurled a large banner reading "Los Angeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido" (Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated). The gesture was a message of support for the community and for Galaxy fans, many of whom have been boycotting their own team due to its silence on the raids. The article highlights how soccer, as a sport with deep immigrant roots, has become a venue for protest against policies affecting many fans personally.</p>

          <p>Despite the high effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV, only about a third of the 1.2 million Americans who could benefit from it are currently taking the medication. The article highlights significant disparities in uptake, with only 13% of at-risk Black people and 24% of at-risk Hispanic people on PrEP, compared to 94% of at-risk white people. Lack of awareness, stigma, and cost are major barriers, as many, particularly heterosexual women, do not realize the drug is an option for them. Advocacy groups are working to normalize conversations about sexual health and improve access to this life-saving medication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A High Court judge has ruled that Hewlett-Packard (HP) is owed approximately £700 million in its lawsuit against the late UK tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, a figure substantially lower than the £4 billion it had sought. The case stemmed from HP's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software firm, Autonomy, which HP later wrote down, alleging its value had been fraudulently inflated. The ruling on damages was delivered following Lynch's tragic death in a yachting accident last year. The judge noted that HP's initial claim was "substantially exaggerated," with Lynch's estate now liable for a portion of the damages.</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, an unarmed 52-year-old man, has been ruled a homicide by the Jefferson County coroner in Alabama. The autopsy report states Reeder died of heart failure associated with cocaine use and restraint during an altercation with Irondale police. His family's lawyers, who have viewed unreleased body camera footage, allege an officer knelt on Reeder's neck for over three minutes while he said he couldn't breathe. The police department disputes this characterization, stating no knee was placed on his neck. The case draws direct comparisons to the 2020 death of George Floyd.</p>
