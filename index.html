          <p>A resilient stock market is fueling consumer spending, potentially keeping the U.S. economy from a recession despite other weak indicators. This "wealth effect" primarily benefits the top 10% of earners who own the vast majority of stocks, creating a fragile foundation for economic stability. Experts warn that if the market were to decline, the lack of broad-based job growth could quickly trigger a recession, as overall consumer sentiment remains low among those not participating in market gains. The economy's dependence on market performance presents a significant risk for its future outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. Potter was sacked after only eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table. Nuno, who was recently dismissed by Nottingham Forest in early September, brings experience from his time at the club, where he led them to their highest league finish in nearly three decades last season. His first match in charge will be an away game against Everton.</p>

          <p>China's DF-5 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a critical component of its nuclear deterrence strategy, despite the development of newer systems like the DF-41. The latest variants of the liquid-fueled DF-5, such as the DF-5C, are believed to have an extended range capable of reaching the entire continental United States. This capability ensures that the older, silo-based missile system continues to play a significant role in the PLA Rocket Force's strategic arsenal. The article provides a brief overview of the missile's history and its continued importance in China's global strike and counterforce posture.</p>

The group is described as an offshoot of the John Brown Gun Club, which has been linked to violent incidents and recently posted recruitment flyers at Georgetown University celebrating political violence. The university stated it respects employees' constitutional rights to free speech and association in their personal capacity, while also condemning all forms of violence. Dixon has a history of charges related to armed protests, though they were later dropped.</p>

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investment firm, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners, which led CCO to divest its European and Latin American assets to become a U.S. pure-play company. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale is the best path forward for shareholders, citing strong private equity interest in the sector and the challenges of restructuring the company's debt and slow digital conversion in the public market.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the nationwide housing shortage and affordability crisis. By manufacturing homes in a factory setting, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional methods. The company recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 modular homes in two months for FEMA to house residents displaced by the Lahaina wildfires. This approach offers a potential model for increasing the supply of affordable housing for essential workers and addressing disaster relief needs across the country.</p>

          <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has voted to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus, which were imposed following the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine's Sports Minister strongly condemned the move, calling it a betrayal of Olympic values.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements on the U.S. economy shows a mix of accurate, misleading, and false claims. While mortgage rates and gasoline prices have indeed decreased recently, his assertions that grocery prices are down and inflation has been defeated are incorrect, as both continue to rise. Federal data also contradicts his claim that energy costs are down, with electricity and natural gas prices having increased over the past year. The stock market has hit record highs, but manufacturing employment has seen a decline, presenting a complex economic picture that doesn't fully align with the administration's optimistic rhetoric.

The article points out that while women are often blamed for various pregnancy outcomes, similar scrutiny is not applied to men, despite factors like advanced paternal age also being linked to certain conditions.

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves mixing soda with flavored syrups and cream, has grown from a Utah-based phenomenon into a national craze influencing major food and beverage companies. Originally popularized by the chain Swig, the concept has been adopted by fast-food giants like Taco Bell and TGI Fridays, while PepsiCo is launching its own ready-to-drink versions. This trend is credited with helping to reverse the long-term decline in U.S. soda consumption by appealing to younger consumers' desire for customizable and visually appealing drinks. For restaurants, it offers an easy, low-cost way to innovate their beverage menus.</p>

          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is developing advanced cockpit alert systems to give pilots more time to react to hazards. The new technology, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide audible and visual warnings like "Traffic on runway!" when a collision is imminent. With serious close calls at U.S. airports peaking in 2023, safety experts and regulators are urging wider adoption of such systems. While not yet required, some airlines like Southwest and Alaska have already implemented existing versions, viewing the technology as a critical layer in the aviation industry's safety model.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered that a man had used an AI-powered website called DeepSwap to create explicit deepfake pornography of them from their social media photos. This case highlights the rapid growth of "nudify" services, which allow users with no technical expertise to generate nonconsensual sexual content, causing significant psychological trauma for victims. Despite the harm, legal recourse is often limited, as the creation of such content may not be illegal if it is not distributed. This has prompted calls for new legislation at both state and federal levels to hold AI companies and users accountable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major broadcast-station groups Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," which began after the host returned to air following a suspension. The suspension was prompted by pressure from the FCC and the station groups over Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination. The stations' decision to resume airing the show signals a defeat in their power struggle with the network, ABC. The article argues that a prolonged boycott was economically unsustainable for the affiliates, as they risked losing significant advertising revenue and valuable network programming like college football, which would have driven viewers to streaming alternatives.</p>

          <p>Nearly nine months after the destructive Eaton fire, residents of Altadena, California, are struggling with the slow and arduous process of rebuilding their community. While some are moving forward, many property owners have not yet applied for building permits, citing exhaustion from insurance battles, concerns about contamination, and the daunting prospect of living in a construction zone for years. The initial defiant spirit of rebuilding has given way to a harsh reality, as homeowners face financial gaps, bureaucratic delays, and emotional trauma. This uncertainty raises questions about what the future of the community will look like and who will decide its fate.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors, to explore the enduring principles of the First Amendment. The author interviews David Goldberger, the ACLU lawyer who, despite being Jewish, defended the group's right to demonstrate, arguing that his true client was the First Amendment itself. Goldberger reflects on the pain the case caused but maintains that free speech must be protected even when it is offensive. The article suggests this historical precedent offers a unifying thought on constitutional principles in today's divided political climate.</p>

          <p>The recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress is being scrutinized by legal experts. They argue that President Trump's long history of public attacks against Comey, combined with his celebratory comments following the indictment, could provide strong grounds for a defense motion to dismiss the case based on selective or vindictive prosecution. The controversial appointment of a Trump ally with no prosecutorial experience to lead the U.S. Attorney's office just before the charges were filed further complicates the case. Comey has maintained his innocence and stated he looks forward to trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to impose a $100,000 fee for all new H-1B visa applications, a program used by high-skill foreign professionals. The administration claims this will encourage companies to hire American workers, but economists like Britta Glennon from the Wharton School argue it will have a detrimental effect. Research indicates that skilled immigrants significantly contribute to innovation and entrepreneurship, and restricting their entry could lead companies to offshore jobs instead. Critics suggest the policy is based on a flawed "fixed number of jobs" theory and will disproportionately hurt startups and universities, making the U.S. less attractive to global talent.

          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries. In many low- and middle-income countries, used car batteries are broken down in unsafe, unregulated conditions, releasing toxic lead dust that contaminates communities and causes irreversible neurological damage. While the problem is vast, proven solutions exist, as demonstrated by countries like Brazil, which successfully formalized its recycling industry through policy changes. Experts argue that treating this as a trade and finance issue, rather than just waste management, can create economic incentives for safer recycling practices.</p>

Detainees allege they are confined in filthy cells, lack adequate food and cleaning supplies, and have suffered medical neglect, with some falling unconscious. They also report that staff have threatened them with solitary confinement and physical force for speaking out. The facility, which rapidly opened to expand ICE's detention capacity, is now California's largest, but advocates and city officials argue it is operating unlawfully without the necessary permits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has launched a series of actions perceived as an assault on free speech, including pressuring a network to suspend a TV host and threatening to prosecute "hate speech." This has created a rift on the American right, with some libertarians and traditional conservatives raising alarms about government overreach and hypocrisy. Critics from institutions like the Cato Institute argue that the administration is engaging in "censorship envy," using state power to suppress speech it dislikes. This turn contradicts Trump's own executive order to end federal censorship and challenges long-held conservative principles regarding the First Amendment.</p>
