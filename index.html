          <p>President Trump is actively seeking a confrontation with California over immigration, a key issue in his agenda. The situation involves a showdown with a major political rival in a heavily Democratic state. This aligns with Trump's strategy of focusing on immigration to energize his base and highlight divisions within the country. The President's approach aims to put pressure on California's leaders and showcase his commitment to stricter immigration enforcement. Optimism surrounding the situation is low given the combative stance. </p>

          <p>China's rare earth exports saw a significant drop in value last month, reflecting Beijing's leverage in trade negotiations with the United States. The value of exported rare earth elements plunged by nearly half compared to the previous year. Analysts have noted that China's control over critical mineral supplies is a key negotiating tool. The data comes as US and China are set to meet for trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Coercive Control in Diddy Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Diddy trial has revealed many lurid details, yet the concept of "coercive control" remains undiscussed. This concept, a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse, is not widely recognized in US courts. Despite not being explicitly discussed, evidence of coercion is present in the charges against Combs. The absence of expert testimony on coercive control may hinder the jury's understanding of the alleged abuse. </p>
