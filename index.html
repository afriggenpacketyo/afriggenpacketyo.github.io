          <p>A letter penned by a Titanic survivor just days before the ship's sinking sold for £300,000 at a UK auction. Colonel Archibald Gracie's handwritten note, dated April 10, 1912, expresses his anticipation for the journey ahead, calling the Titanic a "fine ship". The letter's prophetic nature and historical significance drove the anonymous buyer to pay five times the expected price. This artifact offers a poignant glimpse into the optimism preceding one of history's most tragic maritime disasters, making it a valuable collector's item.</p>

          <p>Animal rights groups are pushing for the relocation of two killer whales, Wikie and Keijo, from a closed marine zoo in France to a whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada. The French government rejected a previous offer from the Whale Sanctuary Project. An application to send them to Loro Parque marine zoo in Tenerife was blocked by Spanish authorities. The fate of the orcas remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A study by the University of Turku suggests that maternal grandmothers have a protective effect on their grandchildren, buffering them from the negative impacts of adverse childhood experiences. The research, analyzing data from English and Welsh youth, found that investment from maternal grandmothers helped mitigate the effects of trauma. The study supports the grandmother hypothesis, highlighting the long-lasting impact of a supportive maternal grandmother on a child's development and well-being.</p>
