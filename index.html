          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has stepped down from his role as executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. The decision was reportedly made by the club's ownership group, the Tavistock Group, amid a desire for greater and more consistent sporting success despite significant off-pitch achievements. During his tenure, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and maintained the club's financial stability, but often faced criticism from fans over a lack of trophies. Peter Charrington will assume the new role of non-executive chairman as the club enters a new era of leadership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially abandoned a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. This rule, introduced under the Biden administration, faced strong opposition from the airline industry, which argued it would lead to higher ticket prices and operational burdens. Airline trade groups have praised the decision to shelve the proposal, which would have required payments for disruptions within a carrier's control. The move aligns with a broader agenda of deregulation favored by the current administration.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense and bipartisan criticism during a contentious Senate hearing regarding his recent policy changes at federal health agencies. Republican senators, including physicians, questioned his decisions to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines and cancel mRNA research funding, invoking the success of President Trump's Operation Warp Speed. Democrats accused him of undermining public health and violating promises made during his confirmation to not restrict vaccine access. Kennedy defended his actions, claiming they were necessary to restore scientific integrity to agencies that he argued have historically relied on flawed data.</p>

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, doubling its valuation to approximately $10 billion. This successful funding round, which included new investment from Nvidia's venture arm, is seen as a crucial step toward a planned initial public offering in 2027. A successful IPO would validate Honeywell's long-term investment in the nascent technology, which has yet to generate significant profits but holds immense potential for solving complex computational problems. The move is part of Honeywell's broader strategy to unlock shareholder value through spinoffs and focusing on core businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danish renewable energy firm Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Interior Department abruptly ordered a halt to construction on its Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, located off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and has already received all necessary permits. Orsted's lawsuit dismisses the government's national security justification as a pretext, arguing the decision is arbitrary and reflects President Trump's long-standing hostility toward wind power. The company states that the stop-work order jeopardizes a $5 billion investment and could incur $1 billion in cancellation costs.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines will end flight service in twelve U.S. cities this October, a decision that comes shortly after the company filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time this year. The move is part of a cost-cutting effort to eliminate unprofitable routes as the airline struggles with high operational costs and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. In response to Spirit's retreat, rival carriers like United Airlines and Frontier Airlines have already announced new routes to capture the market share being vacated. Spirit has stated it will issue refunds to customers with affected reservations.</p>

Other warning signs are using credit cards for essential living expenses like groceries and experiencing significant financial stress, such as anxiety or insomnia over bills.

          <p>The U.S. administration has expressed that it is "very troubled" by the decision of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest from the American company Caterpillar. The fund announced the sale of its stake due to concerns over the use of Caterpillar equipment in the conflict in Gaza, citing an unacceptable risk of contributing to human rights violations. A U.S. State Department spokesperson called the basis for the decision "illegitimate" and confirmed that the government is engaging directly with Norway on the matter. Norway's finance minister responded that the fund's investment decisions are made independently and are not political.</p>

          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a surge in popularity, with August sales up nearly 54% year-over-year, marking the model's best sales month in 21 years. This explosive growth for the three-row SUV stands out as a bright spot for the automaker and indicates continued strong consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. The trend provides a notable contrast to the industry-wide push toward electric vehicles, where Ford has taken a more measured approach than some competitors. The most popular Expedition models are higher-end trims, suggesting consumers are still willing to spend on large, feature-rich vehicles.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are dealing with a pervasive "rotten egg" smell caused by large quantities of an invasive Japanese seaweed. City officials explained that Hurricane Erin's strong winds and high tides pushed the seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, onto shores and into a local estuary. As the seaweed decomposes, it releases a strong, unpleasant odor that residents have compared to gas or sewage. The red seaweed, first recorded on the East Coast in 2009, is known to spread aggressively. Officials have assured the public that the smell is part of a natural process and should dissipate over time.</p>

He claimed, without providing evidence, that the previous administration had "twisted the data" regarding the drug's safety signals, a statement that contradicts decades of scientific research affirming its safety and efficacy. The comment was made in response to a question about whether the Trump administration would reverse Biden-era changes that allowed for telemedicine prescriptions.

He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers, stating the injuries were the result of sepsis.
