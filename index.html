          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to over 27 years in prison after being convicted of plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election results. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Trump swiftly condemned the conviction, labeling it an "unjustly ruled witch hunt" and threatening unspecified retaliatory measures, including tariffs on Brazilian products. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva fiercely rejected this U.S. interference, emphasizing his nation's sovereignty and vowing countermeasures against any trade tariffs, citing historical trade surpluses with the U.S. Analysts anticipate the bilateral relationship will significantly deteriorate, reaching its lowest point in decades following this landmark conviction.</p>

Collins publicly came out in a 2013 Sports Illustrated essay, describing the immense energy it took to guard his secret and the strength he felt upon acknowledging his sexuality. After retiring in 2014 following a 13-year career, he has continued to serve as an ambassador for the NBA.

          <p>Shares of SK Hynix surged over 7% to reach a 25-year high, following the company's announcement of successfully developing HBM4, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. This advanced technology is considered vital for artificial intelligence applications, signaling a significant breakthrough in the semiconductor industry. The positive news fueled broader market gains across Asia, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi also rising, tracking Wall Street's overnight performance. Global investor sentiment is currently buoyed by easing inflation pressures and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, which has propelled major U.S. indexes to new record highs.

          <p>China's new plan to "safeguard the diversity, stability and sustainability" of Scarborough Shoal's ecological system in the South China Sea has significantly heightened tensions with the Philippines. Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano vehemently criticized the initiative, interpreting it as a "clear pretext towards eventual occupation" rather than a genuine environmental effort. The Philippine foreign ministry announced its intention to issue a formal diplomatic protest against what it deems an "illegitimate and unlawful action" by China. Beijing, conversely, defended the move as a legitimate exercise of its sovereignty and urged Manila to cease "infringing and provocative actions," further escalating the diplomatic standoff.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's Amap, a mapping app often compared to Google Maps, has launched a new AI-powered ranking service for mainland Chinese destinations. The "Amap Street Stars" feature, which evaluates restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, attracted over 40 million users on its launch day, demonstrating strong immediate adoption. This initiative is seen as a significant step in Alibaba's broader "super-app strategy," positioning Amap as a primary entry point for offline local services. Moreover, it poses a direct competitive challenge to rival Meituan's established Dianping review service, intensifying the instant commerce segment.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to "think twice" before implementing plans to hike tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50% from the current 20%. The ministry emphasized the mutual importance of China and Mexico as trade partners and stated that China would take "necessary measures" to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests if the tariffs proceed. Mexico's proposed tariffs, which still require Congressional approval, are largely aimed at Chinese vehicles and reflect ongoing global trade tensions, particularly in the automotive industry. This diplomatic exchange signals potential escalation in trade disputes between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has intensified concerns over campus security and the state of free speech, prompting university police chiefs to re-evaluate their protocols. Despite the presence of multiple security personnel, the fatal shot was fired from a rooftop, highlighting significant vulnerabilities at large public events. Experts note the constant balancing act between ensuring safety and protecting free expression, with some commentators now fearing an "assassin's veto" on controversial speakers. Disturbingly, recent surveys also indicate an increase in students who find violence acceptable to silence certain speech, underscoring a dangerous trend in public discourse.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison after being convicted of plotting a military coup to remain in power following his 2022 election loss. A panel of five Supreme Court justices found him guilty of leading a conspiracy, a ruling his lawyers immediately condemned as "absurdly excessive" while vowing to file appeals. The court also imposed a ban on him running for public office until 2033, effectively ending his political career. This landmark decision makes the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in Brazil's history to be convicted for actively threatening the nation's democracy.</p>

Despite this, prosecutors presented compelling evidence, including cellphone data, security footage, and a handwritten note from Routh expressing an intent to kill Trump.

          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers five expert tips to help parents manage fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children. Key advice includes allowing children autonomy in choosing what to eat and when to leave the table, fostering independence rather than forcing consumption. She also recommends avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad" to prevent negative associations, and prioritizing enjoyment during mealtimes to create a positive environment. Additionally, being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite and involving them in food preparation are crucial strategies to foster a healthy relationship with food and reduce mealtime stress.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has delivered a landmark ruling, affirming that men can legally take their wives' family names, thereby overturning a discriminatory apartheid-era law. The previous legislation had only permitted women to change their surnames upon marriage. Justice Loena Theron stated that the existing law infringed on gender equality rights enshrined in the post-apartheid constitution and was a "colonial import." The court suspended the current legislation for two years, providing the government time to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. This progressive decision, while sparking mixed reactions on social media, affirms cultural traditions where women often retained their birth names.</p>

          <p>China's US$12 trillion equity market is experiencing stunning gains, presenting a significant challenge to regulators tasked with guiding a measured yet sustainable bull run. Beijing aims to position the stock market as a steady source of household income to support consumer spending and broader economic growth, thereby shifting wealth away from the volatile property market. Regulators are keen to avoid the wild booms and busts that characterized the past two decades, with recent moderation in gains seen as a positive step towards reducing the risk of volatile retail investor behavior. The ultimate goal is to emulate the stable market growth observed in countries like India, Japan, and the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have voted to change chamber rules, effectively employing the "nuclear option," to streamline the confirmation process for President Trump's non-cabinet level nominees. This controversial move allows the Senate to confirm certain executive branch, sub-Cabinet, and ambassador nominees in batches, rather than requiring individual votes for each. Senate Majority Leader John Thune initiated the change to address criticisms of Democratic obstruction and the increasingly lengthy confirmation times, which have nearly quadrupled in recent administrations. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vehemently opposed the change, viewing it as another act of "genuflection to the executive branch" and a weakening of legislative oversight.</p>
