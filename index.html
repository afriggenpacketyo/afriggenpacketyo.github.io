          <p>The United States and the European Union are in critical trade negotiations as a July 9 deadline for new U.S. tariffs on EU goods approaches. Officials are pessimistic about reaching a comprehensive agreement in time, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggesting an "agreement in principle" is the most realistic goal. This bare-bones deal would aim to prevent the immediate imposition of duties up to 50% on EU goods and subsequent retaliatory measures from Brussels. Experts believe this approach is intended to buy more time for detailed negotiations over the complex transatlantic trade relationship, which is valued at nearly $2 trillion.

          <p>A major power outage struck large areas of the Czech Republic, causing significant but temporary disruption across the country. The national grid operator, CEPS, confirmed the blackout was caused by a fallen power line. The incident halted train services in five districts and briefly knocked Prague's subway system offline. Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the situation as an "extraordinary and unpleasant" event. However, CEPS reported that electricity was restored to the majority of affected areas relatively quickly, minimizing the overall impact of the widespread failure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare and dramatic intervention, French police waded into the sea to slash an inflatable boat crowded with migrants, including women and children, that was struggling in the waves off the coast of Boulogne. This action, which is contrary to their usual rules of engagement, occurred as the boat appeared to be in danger with a stalled motor. The incident highlights the growing pressure on French authorities to curb the surge of small boat crossings to the UK. While the intervention prevented the boat's departure, it also underscores the chaotic and desperate scenes unfolding on the French coast.</p>

          <p>Following his recent boxing victory, Jake Paul posted a taunting American flag emoji on social media after his opponent, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security announced Chavez Jr. is being processed for expedited removal from the country. His arrest stems from a 2024 conviction for possession of an assault weapon and an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged involvement with the Sinaloa Cartel. This development adds another layer to the rivalry following the high-profile bout between the two fighters.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photos of China's J-20A stealth fighter are generating speculation about its public debut at an upcoming military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The images reveal significant technical upgrades, most notably modified diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI) designed to optimize airflow for the advanced, domestically produced WS-15 engines. These changes are expected to enhance both the fighter's stealth capabilities and its aerodynamic performance. The sighting suggests a new level of maturity for the advanced aircraft program as China prepares to showcase its latest military hardware.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he was "very disappointed" with a recent phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, confirming he made no progress toward a potential deal on the war in Ukraine. This diplomatic setback comes as the White House announced a halt on some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision attributed to concerns over dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. The call, which the Kremlin noted lasted nearly an hour, underscores the ongoing stalemate and Mr. Trump's frustration with the protracted conflict.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical essay argues that the Continental Army, under General George Washington, was instrumental in building a unified American national identity out of 13 disparate and often competing colonies. Before the Revolutionary War, colonists identified more as Britons than with each other. The shared experience of war—its hardships, travel, and sacrifices—blurred local loyalties and fostered new national bonds among soldiers. The army also created foundational national symbols and traditions, such as a unified flag and the celebration of Washington's birthday, which replaced festivities for the King, thereby laying the groundwork for a new American culture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay offers a personal and contemporary reflection on Virginia Woolf's seminal 1928 work, "A Room of One's Own." The author recounts her initial dismissal of the book as a totem of exclusionary white feminism, only to later discover its profound and enduring relevance. The article explores how Woolf’s arguments about the necessity of financial independence and personal space for women's creativity still resonate today. It also lovingly critiques the book's class-based blind spots while celebrating its fire and rage against the limitations placed upon women, connecting its themes to modern intersectional feminist thought.</p>

This move is compounding existing worries and reportedly accelerating a trend among international investors to diversify their assets and reduce exposure to the U.S. dollar.

          <p>A new analysis of the recently passed Republican spending bill warns that its deep cuts to Medicaid could have catastrophic consequences for rural Americans. In states like North Carolina, the reduction in federal funding could activate a "kill switch" law, automatically ending the state's Medicaid expansion and stripping coverage from over 650,000 people. Experts predict that across the country, the cuts will imperil financially fragile rural hospitals, which rely on Medicaid reimbursement to stay open. This could force many to restrict services or close entirely, leaving vulnerable populations without access to essential healthcare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Lakers prepare for the NBA Summer League, second-year players Bronny James and Dalton Knecht are ready to demonstrate their development. James, who faced immense pressure playing alongside his father last season, stated he feels more confident and "nervous-free" heading into the games. Knecht, who had a solid rookie year, has been working diligently on his shooting and game since the playoffs ended. Both players are focused on taking on larger roles and showcasing their improvement, with a highly anticipated matchup against No. 1 draft pick Cooper Flagg on the schedule.</p>

          <p>The body of Dr. Marites Buenafe, a 62-year-old doctor who went missing in Alaska, has been found by authorities. Dr. Buenafe disembarked from the Norwegian Bliss cruise ship in Juneau to go on a hike up Mount Roberts and was reported missing when she did not return for the ship's departure. After a multi-day search involving ground teams, drones, and helicopters from multiple agencies, her body was located by an Alaska Army National Guard crew approximately 1,700 feet below a ridge line. Her body is being sent for an autopsy to determine the cause of death.</p>

          <p>A new trade pact between the U.S. and Vietnam appears to be a direct strike against Chinese manufacturers rerouting goods to evade American tariffs. The agreement includes a standard 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods but a much higher 40% "transshipping" tariff on items originating elsewhere but shipped from Vietnam to the U.S. This move targets the common practice of using Vietnam as a hub to sidestep duties on direct Chinese exports. Analysts note that enforcing this will be challenging for Hanoi, which must now define what constitutes transshipment versus legitimate local assembly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery in China's Yunnan province is reshaping the understanding of early human technology in East Asia. Researchers have unearthed dozens of well-preserved wooden artifacts at the Gantangqing site, dated to be 300,000 years old. This find provides the first substantial evidence of a sophisticated "Wood Age" in the region, a period where wood was a primary material for toolmaking. Because wood decomposes easily, direct evidence of such tools has been scarce, and this world-class discovery helps fill a major gap in the study of the Chinese Palaeolithic era.</p>

          <p>This essay argues that the recent $16 million settlement paid by Paramount to President Trump's future presidential library is a form of political extortion. The payment resolved a lawsuit Trump filed against the Paramount-owned CBS over an interview, which the author contends was frivolous and would have been easily won in court. The article posits that Paramount was coerced into paying to ensure that a pending $8 billion merger would receive approval from the Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This incident is presented as part of a larger, disturbing pattern of a "mafia presidency" using threats to enrich itself.</p>
