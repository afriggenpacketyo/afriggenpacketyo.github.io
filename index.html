          <p>President Donald Trump, speaking in Scotland, announced his intention to set a blanket tariff of 15% to 20% on imports from countries without a specific trade agreement with the United States. This represents a potential increase from the 10% baseline previously discussed for smaller nations. The statement comes as an August 1st deadline approaches for numerous countries to negotiate individual deals or face these new tariffs. The administration has indicated it is not under pressure to secure more deals, suggesting a broad application of the new tariff rate is likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference in Scotland, President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, labeling him a "nasty person" who has done a "terrible job." UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was present, interjected to state that Khan is a friend of his. A spokesperson for the mayor responded by highlighting London's diversity and noting a record number of Americans have applied for British citizenship during Trump's presidency. The exchange continues a pattern of public criticism between the two political figures.</p>

          <p>Michigan authorities are seeking to file terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect, Bradford James Gille, allegedly used a folding knife in the attack on Saturday afternoon. When law enforcement arrived, armed citizens were already confronting the suspect in the parking lot, preventing further harm. All eleven victims, who range in age from 21 to 84, are expected to survive the attack, with their conditions reportedly improving at a local medical center.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for President Donald Trump are asking a judge to compel an early deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit. The suit concerns a Wall Street Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's legal team argues for the urgency of the deposition by citing Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health issues, suggesting he may be unavailable to testify if the case proceeds at a normal pace. Murdoch's legal team is reportedly opposing the request for an expedited testimony.</p>

          <p>Following England's victory in the Euro 2025 final, defender Lucy Bronze revealed she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia. Medical experts suggest the injury was likely a stress or fatigue fracture of the shin bone, rather than a complete break, which would have made playing impossible. The 33-year-old started all six games for the Lionesses, playing nearly 600 minutes. Her ability to perform at an elite level despite the injury has been called "remarkable" and is seen as a testament to her mental resilience and the skill of England's medical staff.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) claims that UK hospitals have made a record number of requests for striking resident doctors to return to work during a five-day walkout over pay. The union alleges that many of these emergency pleas, known as derogations, were inappropriately made to cover non-urgent care, a consequence of NHS England's directive to maintain elective services. While the BMA has granted some requests, it has also refused many, leading to accusations from NHS officials that the union is risking patient safety by second-guessing the needs of frontline clinicians.</p>

Despite widespread poverty and a lack of prospects for the country's youth, Biya faces a fragmented opposition.

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional" ceasefire to end violent border clashes that have killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was reached during talks chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is acting as a mediator for the ASEAN regional bloc. The fighting flared after a land mine explosion, with both nations blaming each other. This diplomatic breakthrough is a crucial first step toward de-escalation and restoring stability in the disputed border region.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Secretary of State, Sarah Godlewski, has announced she will not run for governor in 2026 but is considering a bid for lieutenant governor. Her decision comes after Democratic Governor Tony Evers declared he would not seek a third term, opening up the field in the key battleground state. Godlewski, who was appointed to her current role in 2023, is now making calls to state leaders to gauge support for a potential run for the state's number two position. This development further shapes the evolving landscape of Wisconsin's upcoming gubernatorial election.</p>

          <p>A widespread and dangerous heatwave is impacting more than 185 million people across the eastern half of the United States, from the Midwest down to Florida and up the East Coast. Heat indices, which combine temperature and humidity, are forecast to reach between 105 and 115 degrees in many areas, with parts of the Southeast potentially feeling as hot as 120 degrees. The prolonged heat is expected to continue through midweek, with little relief overnight. Additionally, smoke from Canadian wildfires is creating hazy conditions and air quality concerns in the Northeast.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old girl from Bolton, UK, suffered a severe arm injury during a family holiday in Turkey. While she was enjoying a foam party in a swimming pool at a Marmaris resort, a large pane of glass was blown from a DJ booth, and a shard cut her arm down to the bone. Doctors who treated her said she was millimeters away from having tendons severed. The girl's family is now taking legal action against the holiday operator, arguing that having unsecured glass next to a crowded pool was an obvious and avoidable hazard.</p>

          <p>In a departure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position, President Donald Trump acknowledged that there is "real starvation" occurring in Gaza. When asked if he agreed with Netanyahu's claim that such reports are a "bold-faced lie," Trump replied, "I don't know," but added that images of children from the region show they look "very hungry." The comments were made during a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who described the situation as an "absolute catastrophe." This marks a notable divergence in messaging between the U.S. and Israeli leaders on the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The first trailer has been released for "Avatar: Fire and Ash," the third installment in James Cameron's science-fiction saga. The footage introduces a new Na'vi tribe, the Mangkwan Clan or "Ash People," who inhabit a volcanic region and are led by the fierce Varang. Positioned as adversaries to Jake Sully's family, this new clan signals a narrative shift from the underwater world of the previous film. Cameron has hinted the movie will move beyond a simple "humans are bad, Na'vi are good" paradigm, promising a more morally complex story.</p>

          <p>A Swiss study has found that the human immune system may react to the mere visual suggestion of an infection. Researchers used virtual reality to show participants avatars of human faces, some of which appeared sick with a cough or rash. Blood samples taken afterward showed increased activity of specific immune cells, indicating the brain had triggered an immune response without any actual exposure to a pathogen. The findings suggest a powerful link between visual perception and immunology, which could open new therapeutic avenues for modulating the immune system.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has sold a portion of its shares in the industrial manufacturer Eaton, as the stock reached another record high. The article explains the move as a profit-taking strategy, capitalizing on the stock's 20% year-to-date gain, which was recently boosted by the US-EU trade deal. The rationale is to lock in a significant gain and reallocate the capital into other industrial stocks that have lagged but show strong potential. The sale will realize a gain of approximately 75% on shares purchased in late 2023. (not investment advice)</p>
