          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has confirmed she will not run for a third term in 2026, a decision that will create an open Senate seat in a state that has trended increasingly Republican. First elected in 2014, Ernst's retirement is a significant development in Iowa politics, prompting other prominent figures like GOP Representative Ashley Hinson to consider a campaign for the position. The announcement sets the stage for a competitive race, as Democrats are energized by recent special election victories and have several candidates already exploring a run for the seat.</p>

          <p>The July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report indicated that inflation in the U.S. remained persistent, with the annual rate holding steady at 2.6%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, slightly increased to 2.9%, posing a challenge for the Federal Reserve as it considers its next interest rate decision. Despite the sticky inflation, consumer spending saw a modest rise, though many Americans are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases. Analysts still broadly anticipate the Fed will proceed with an interest rate cut in September to support a slowing job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court hearing concluded without an immediate decision on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order against President Trump's attempt to fire her. Cook's lawsuit challenges the legality of the removal, which was based on allegations of mortgage fraud from a Trump appointee. Her lawyers argued the accusations are a pretext for a politically motivated firing, while the Department of Justice maintained it is within the president's discretion. The judge has requested further written arguments, leaving Cook's fate and a key question of Fed independence unresolved for now.</p>

          <p>Al DiStefano, a 77-year-old man in Texas, has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring more than half a century after it slipped from his finger into the waters off Long Island, New York. The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, an electrician using a metal detector, who decided to track down the owner rather than sell the valuable palladium it is made from. Through an online search and a university alumni Facebook page, Orlowski successfully found DiStefano, who called the ring's return a "miracle."

          <p>"Saturday Night Live" is facing a significant cast shake-up ahead of its 51st season, with veteran Heidi Gardner and several other performers announcing their exits.

The departures follow the show's 50th-anniversary season, after which producer Lorne Michaels indicated it was time for a change.

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of statehood and a failure to repudiate terrorism as reasons for the decision. This move is unusual for a UN host country and comes as several nations, led by France, are pushing to recognize a Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the decision as a violation of international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement.</p>

This challenge is part of a broader pattern of legal pushback against similar appointments of Trump allies in other districts.

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered more fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was an unusually armed "punk rocker" dinosaur that lived 165 million years ago. The new findings, published in the journal *Nature*, show that the herbivorous dinosaur had long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any other vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, which were thought to have developed their heavy armor later in response to large predators. The fossils, found in Morocco, paint a picture of one of the strangest dinosaurs ever discovered.</p>

In a message to staff, CEO Rami Atallah pointed to increased trade pressures, particularly the recent U.S. suspension of the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed for duty-free shipping of small packages. This policy change, combined with tighter market liquidity and a lender's move to force a sale, created an untenable financial situation for the popular online retailer. The company, valued at $4 billion in 2021, plans to continue operations as it restructures under creditor protection.</p>

The judge is considering Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to block her removal while the case proceeds.

In 2020, Braxton was the sole candidate but was blocked from taking office, leading to a prolonged legal fight.

          <p>Bank of America has increased its price target for Snowflake stock, viewing the company's recent strong quarter as a turning point in its transition into a comprehensive enterprise data platform. The company's product revenue grew 32% year-over-year, and its net revenue retention rate ticked up for the first time in 13 quarters, indicating increased spending from existing customers. Analysts noted that clients are now using Snowflake for a wider range of workloads beyond core analytics, including AI and data science, justifying its premium valuation compared to other large-cap software companies.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron held a joint cabinet meeting aimed at repairing and strengthening the Franco-German relationship, which had become strained under the previous German administration. The leaders projected a warm personal rapport while tackling significant challenges, including the war in Ukraine, defense cooperation, and energy policy. They announced progress on key joint military projects and resolved a long-standing dispute over nuclear power. Despite the positive tone, fundamental differences in national interests and Macron's domestic political troubles could still test the renewed partnership.</p>

He contrasts his son's experience with his own first day of school in a dirt-floor building in rural Uganda, a stark reminder of the disparities in educational opportunities worldwide. The author, who was orphaned by the AIDS epidemic and later adopted by an American family, sees his son's milestone as the culmination of his own journey and the sacrifices made by many.

          <p>For seniors looking to tap into their home equity without sacrificing low mortgage rates through refinancing, several options remain viable. The article highlights three primary methods: reverse mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). A reverse mortgage, available to homeowners 62 and older, allows for receiving payments from equity without requiring monthly repayments. Home equity loans offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, while HELOCs provide a flexible line of credit with variable rates, allowing homeowners to leverage record-high equity levels amid a challenging interest rate environment.

          <p>Marvell Technology stock plummeted after the chipmaker's second-quarter data center revenue missed analyst estimates and the company issued a lackluster forecast for the current quarter. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, fueled by AI demand, the key data center segment's performance and a flat sequential growth projection disappointed investors. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the forecast's "lumpiness" to the nonlinear nature of infrastructure build-outs by large clients. The results prompted a stock downgrade and price target reduction from Bank of America, reflecting concern over near-term growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

The comments followed reports that European officials were considering a 40km demilitarized strip. Zelensky asserted that if Russia wants distance, it should retreat from occupied Ukrainian territories, reiterating that Russia is not genuinely ready for diplomacy.</p>

While the Guard's official mission is vague, their presence has chilled daily life, particularly in immigrant communities, and raised concerns that D.C. is a test case for using the military as a domestic police force. The article observes that the Guardsmen themselves often seem unsure of their purpose, engaging in tasks like "beautification projects" and tourist-like patrols.

          <p>Tesla is seeking to overturn or significantly reduce a $242.5 million verdict against the company in a wrongful death lawsuit involving its Autopilot system. The case stems from a 2019 crash in Florida where a Model S driver, distracted while using Enhanced Autopilot, accelerated through an intersection, killing one person and severely injuring another. In its appeal, Tesla argues that the vehicle had no design defects and the crash was caused entirely by driver recklessness. The company is asking for the verdict to be tossed or, alternatively, for damages to be steeply reduced based on Florida's statutory caps.</p>
