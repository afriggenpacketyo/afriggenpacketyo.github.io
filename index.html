          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek won her first Wimbledon singles title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory. The match, which lasted less than an hour, marked only the second time in the Open era that a Wimbledon final was won with a "double bagel." The win is a historic first for a Polish singles player at the tournament. Anisimova's journey to the final was also notable, marking a significant comeback after she took an indefinite break from tennis in 2023 for mental health reasons.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested 71 people across London, Cardiff, and Manchester during protests against the UK government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The ban, enacted under the Terrorism Act of 2000, makes supporting the group a criminal offense. Protesters gathered for a second weekend, arguing the ban is an authoritarian misuse of power, while the government maintains the group's history of criminal damage against arms companies poses a risk to national security. The proscription followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' 23-year-old pitching prospect, Jacob Misiorowski, has been named an All-Star after just five major league games, a move that has generated significant controversy. While Misiorowski has demonstrated remarkable talent, including throwing at 103 mph and maintaining a 2.81 ERA, many critics argue the selection is unearned. Commentators and fans have pointed to more experienced, high-performing players like Philadelphia's Christopher Sanchez who were overlooked, sparking a debate about whether the honor was deserved or a marketing move by MLB.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that imports from the European Union and Mexico will be subject to a 30% tariff beginning August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited persistent trade deficits with the EU and insufficient border security efforts by Mexico as the reasons for the new duties. The announcement has drawn strong disapproval from European leaders, who have warned of potential countermeasures if a negotiated agreement is not reached. This move is part of a broader tariff strategy affecting multiple U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has discreetly countered attacks from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. The move comes after officials, including OMB Director Russell Vought, criticized the project as an "ostentatious overhaul" and accused Fed Chairman Jerome Powell of mismanagement. The Fed's webpage directly refutes claims of building new VIP dining rooms and explains cost increases were due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos, clarifying that the project is self-funded and not paid for by taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market has remained largely stable near record highs, even as the Trump administration has renewed its campaign of tariff threats against major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating tactics and are less prone to panic than in the past. The market's underlying strength is also attributed to powerful trends such as the growth of artificial intelligence and a deregulatory environment that encourages mergers and IPOs, which are seen as driving corporate earnings.

          <p>A new CNBC analysis has ranked the U.S. state economies based on their preparedness for a potential recession, with Florida, Texas, and North Carolina taking the top spots. The study evaluated states on factors including GDP and job growth, fiscal health, and the number of major corporate headquarters. It also weighed each state's vulnerability to federal budget cuts and the ongoing trade war. States with diverse economies, strong fiscal management, and less dependence on international trade or federal spending were rated as the most resilient. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariffs from the ongoing trade war, U.S. companies are increasingly using Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce taxes on imported goods. These customs-sanctioned areas allow businesses to store, assemble, or modify foreign components duty-free, with taxes only collected when the final product enters U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow, though recent executive orders have eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product.

          <p>An investigation has found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved multiple appeals to remove dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map in the years preceding a catastrophic flood that killed at least 27 people. The prestigious Texas girls' summer camp, located in a region known as "flash flood alley," was able to expand its operations with less regulatory oversight after the map changes. Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek exemptions from basic flood regulations in such a high-risk area.</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, founder of Ithaca Hummus, has built a company projected to earn $50 million this year, starting from a farmers market operation he ran while attending Cornell University. After burning out from the restaurant industry, Kirby identified a market gap for fresh, high-quality hummus and launched his business with startup costs under $4,000. By focusing on slow, deliberate growth and maximizing sales within existing territories rather than rapid expansion, he has turned Ithaca Hummus into a profitable brand sold in over 8,000 U.S. retailers.</p>

          <p>Military experts suggest Russia's recent escalation in drone and missile attacks on Ukraine is a calculated strategy to overwhelm air defenses and demoralize the population. The campaign aims to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial complex and pressure its government by targeting civilian areas and infrastructure. Analysts believe this may be preparation for a new summer offensive, leveraging Russia's expanded domestic drone production. For Ukraine to counter this, experts stress the urgent need for increased Western investment and advanced air defense systems.</p>

          <p>New UK regulations under the Online Safety Act will soon legally require tech platforms to prevent children from viewing harmful content, such as pornography and material encouraging self-harm. The rules, enforced by Ofcom, will mandate age verification measures, with heavy fines for non-compliance. However, a debate is already underway about the law's effectiveness, as it does not cover private messaging, in-app purchases, or the full scope of AI chatbots. Critics and some politicians argue the rules are already outdated and do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>According to author James Patterson, Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, believed he could commit the perfect crime but was undone by a critical mistake. Patterson claims Kohberger, an arrogant and socially awkward criminology student, experienced "tunnel vision" during the act and left behind a knife sheath, which ultimately led to his arrest. The analysis suggests Kohberger's motive may have stemmed from social and romantic rejection, drawing parallels to other killers who acted out of similar frustrations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's announcement that he is forming a new political party, the "America Party," has been met with skepticism from political experts. While there is public appetite for an alternative to the two major parties, analysts argue that third parties in the U.S. historically succeed by disrupting and influencing major parties on specific issues, not by winning congressional seats. The venture also faces challenges unique to its founder, as recent polling shows that 60% of Americans hold an unfavorable view of Musk.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep-space exploration program, posing the most significant challenge to U.S. space leadership in decades. The nation aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with major hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development. While NASA's Artemis program officially targets an earlier landing date of 2027, it faces significant technical hurdles, such as the need for unproven in-orbit refueling technology. This sets the stage for an intensified space race between the two global powers.</p>
