          <p>The United Arab Emirates National Guard rescued the crew of an oil tanker, Adalynn, after it collided with another ship, Front Eagle, in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil gateway. British maritime security firm Ambrey reported that the collision was not security-related, and Frontline, the shipping company managing Front Eagle, described it as a navigational incident unrelated to the Israel-Iran conflict. Concerns have grown about potential disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for about a fifth of the world's oil, amid escalating regional hostilities. Frontline had previously declined new contracts to sail into the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz due to the deteriorating situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early to address the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, following a warning to Iranians to evacuate Tehran. Vance Boelter faces federal and state murder charges for the killings of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, as well as the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife. Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family reached a $7.4 billion settlement with all 50 states and U.S. territories over the company's improper marketing of opioids, with a key change allowing individuals harmed by OxyContin to pursue civil lawsuits against the Sackler family.

          <p>Experts are questioning the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed $499 gold Trump phone can be entirely manufactured in the United States, with one analyst calling it "virtually impossible." The phone, alongside a mobile phone service priced at $47.45 monthly, has raised ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest and profiting from the presidency. While Eric Trump suggested the phones released in August may not be fully manufactured in the U.S., technology experts doubt the possibility of producing smartphones from scratch domestically. The Trump Organization has not provided details on its business partner or specifics on its "built in the United States" claim.</p>

The strikes lasted for over nine hours, forcing residents to seek shelter underground, and a U.S. citizen was among those killed.

Critics on social media have labeled her speech a "meltdown" and revisited her role in school closures during the pandemic.

Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concern about the outlook for Japan's economy, citing U.S. President Trump's tariff hikes as downside risks. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026, a decrease from the current 400 billion yen. Ueda stated that the BOJ will continue raising interest rates as needed but noted that trade policies in other countries pose a downside risk. (not investment advice)</p>

Addressing the G7 summit in Canada, von der Leyen returned to a more hawkish stance on China after a period of toned-down criticism. She emphasized that the biggest challenges stem from China's accession to the WTO in 2001. The comments set the stage for a potential showdown at the EU-China Summit in Beijing next month.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly built the world's first 6G-powered electronic warfare system, leveraging a next-generation signal processing mechanism. The system can master the high-frequency spectrum with precision and ease. Its photon-powered core can intercept enemy signals and generate over 3,600 false targets to confuse enemy pilots at 12GHz or higher frequencies. The weapon can also perform the role of a powerful communication device, receiving or transmitting a huge amount of battlefield data simultaneously to more than 300 cooperative platforms via optic fibres at an extremely high speed.</p>
