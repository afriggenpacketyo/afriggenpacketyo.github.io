        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of his tariffs illegal, arguing that the decision undermines U.S. trade policy and economic leverage. The administration asserts that the tariffs are essential for promoting peace and economic prosperity, while a group of small businesses challenging the tariffs expresses confidence in prevailing before the Supreme Court. The administration is seeking an expedited review, citing the need for a swift resolution to avoid jeopardizing ongoing trade negotiations and diplomatic efforts. The case centers on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the tariffs and whether the law unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president.

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF) is urging the Senate Finance Committee to question Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding the removal of safety protocols for the abortion pill mifepristone. ROAF argues that the Biden administration's rollback of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements endangers women by allowing the abortion pill to be prescribed via telehealth and delivered through the mail. The FDA originally required in-person dispensing to ensure women were screened for potential complications. ROAF insists that women deserve to know about potential complications and have immediate access to emergency care if needed.</p>

          <p>A Cal State Channel Island professor, Jonathan Caravello, has been indicted on felony assault charges for allegedly throwing a tear gas canister back at U.S. Border Patrol agents during a protest against an immigration raid at a Ventura County marijuana farm. The incident occurred during a clash between protesters and agents, with prosecutors claiming Caravello chased after the canister and threw it at officers. Caravello, who was initially charged with felony assault but later faced a misdemeanor charge, has pleaded not guilty and claims he was protecting people at the protest. The grand jury's indictment reinstates the felony charge, and Caravello will be arraigned in the coming weeks.</p>

Under the proposed law, Texas residents could sue those involved in manufacturing, transporting, or providing abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000, but women who receive the pills would not be liable.</p>

          <p>The UK and its allies are prepared to support Ukraine both before negotiations to end the war and to secure an eventual peace deal, according to the UK defense secretary. On the eve of a top-level meeting in Paris, John Healey stated that allies would help secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once a peace deal is reached. However, Russia's President Vladimir Putin conveyed a defiant message, suggesting the invasion could continue. Healey praised US President Donald Trump for bringing Putin into talks, despite criticism of Trump's warm welcome to the Russian leader last month in Alaska.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that Americans continue to view the U.S. economy negatively, describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling". Positive views of the economy have remained relatively stable throughout the year, with a third of Americans using the terms "rebounding" or "expanding." The poll highlights concerns about rising prices, with two-thirds of respondents stating that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. Personal financial situations are linked to perceptions of price changes, with those who believe prices are rising more likely to report their own situation as bad. (not investment advice)</p>

These agentic frameworks provide tools for building, deploying, and managing AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks for users. This development reflects China's growing capabilities in the AI sector and its competition with U.S. players like AutoGen and OpenAI Swarm.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as a "Democrat hoax" while efforts on Capitol Hill intensify to release all files related to the deceased sex offender. Trump stated that "thousands of pages of documents have been given" but that the issue is irrelevant to his administration's success. His comments came as Epstein survivors and House members push for the Justice Department to release withheld records. A resolution instructing the House Oversight Committee to continue its investigation was adopted, but some argue that it is insufficient compared to a full release of the files.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent military strike against alleged "narco-terrorists" in the Caribbean signifies an expansion of the counterterrorism campaign and the military's involvement in crime fighting. This action, along with other deployments of the National Guard within the U.S., raises concerns about the blurring lines between military and law enforcement roles. Critics argue that these tactics deviate from the traditional understanding of the military's purpose and could lead to overreach. The administration defends its actions as necessary to protect national interests and combat threats, but legal experts question the legal justification and potential for abuse.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked President Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, finding "no invasion or predatory incursion." The court ruled that the situation with the Tren de Aragua gang does not meet the definition of either an "invasion" or a "predatory incursion." The Trump administration argued that the gang's members were engaged in an incursion through "mass illegal migration," but the court rejected this argument. The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas.</p>
