          <p>A horrific act of targeted violence occurred at a Michigan church during a Sunday morning worship service, resulting in at least four fatalities and eight injuries. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Marine Corps veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle through the church doors, opened fire on hundreds of congregants with an assault rifle, and then deliberately set the building ablaze. Police engaged Sanford, who died at the scene, and are investigating his unconfirmed motive, while also responding to additional bomb threats in the community. This devastating incident, now an FBI-led case, prompted increased security at religious institutions and left the Grand Blanc community in profound shock, with officials offering support and urging prayers for the victims and their families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores practical strategies for identifying and managing "energy vampire" friends, individuals who consistently drain one's emotional and mental energy. These friends often display an excessive need for attention and reassurance, complain frequently, and show minimal interest in others' lives, leaving companions feeling exhausted and unheard. Experts suggest that recognizing one's own drained feelings after interactions is a crucial indicator of such relationships. Recommended approaches include engaging in open and honest conversations about the imbalance, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent together or discussion topics, and proposing alternative activities like walks or exercise to alter interaction dynamics and safeguard personal well-being and emotional health.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Grand Blanc, Michigan, have identified the gunman in Sunday's deadly church shooting as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sanford killed at least four people and injured eight others at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints before dying in an exchange of gunfire with police at the scene. Investigators are currently searching Sanford's home, located seven miles from the church, for potential bomb-making materials, though it remains unknown if anything was found. The local community remains deeply shaken by the tragedy, with residents expressing profound sorrow and a strong call for societal change to address the escalating problem of violence in their suburban community.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing intense media speculation about his future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions in funding. His departure sets up a three-way contest between Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who faced a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, maintained he was "wrongfully charged" and expressed pride in his administration's accomplishments.

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are expected to formally resign, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to implement sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. This unprecedented exodus coincides with a looming government shutdown deadline, as the White House has also instructed federal agencies to develop plans for large-scale firings if a funding agreement is not secured. Departing workers have described a climate of "fear and intimidation," feeling compelled to leave due to a perceived erosion of their mission, scapegoating, and uncertain job security. The program highlights significant tensions between the administration's goals and the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is prioritizing the establishment of a robust supply chain for green methanol to achieve its ambitious environmental goals for marine fuels, as stated by CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already developed capabilities for liquefied natural gas and biodiesel, green methanol necessitates a dedicated infrastructure for importing, storing, and selling mainland-produced fuel on a tax-free basis. The newly launched dual-fuel vehicle carrier, CM Hong Kong, currently operates with one-quarter green methanol, despite this fuel being four times more expensive than conventional options. The company expects to progressively increase its green methanol usage starting in 2027, driven by Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariff regime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigative article reveals serious allegations of unsafe conditions and staff negligence at Schoen Clinic York's specialist eating disorder unit. Staff were reportedly photographed sleeping while meant to be monitoring vulnerable patients, contributing to multiple "unsafe" incidents. Whistleblowers and former patients recounted instances of staff failing to intervene during self-harm, serving unhygienic food, and using triggering language like "you're not skinny enough to be in here." Despite a previous "good" rating from regulators, patients felt their conditions deteriorated. The unit has since closed, and its co-located dementia unit also faced a temporary halt on new admissions over safety concerns, underscoring systemic issues in patient care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of its executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, which unilaterally reinterprets the 14th Amendment. Despite two federal courts universally blocking the order on different grounds, Solicitor General John Sauer urges a definitive judgment, asserting a compelling government interest in restricting citizenship to those lawfully entitled. The order would exclude newborns whose parents lack permanent legal status, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands annually. Legal scholars, citing the 1898 U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark precedent, believe the Supreme Court is unlikely to rule in Trump's favor, but the administration likely views the challenge as a politically advantageous fight.</p>

Jahn, who legally purchased an 8mm rifle, fired from a nearby rooftop, intending to damage property and harm or kill ICE personnel. One detainee, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, died, and two others were critically injured. Marcos Charles, ICE executive associate director, attributed a 1,000% increase in assaults on officers to "wild rhetoric," emphasizing the dangers posed by apps tracking agents.</p>

The attack follows Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's plea for international help at the UN General Assembly, while President Trump suggested NATO should shoot down Russian drones violating airspace.

At least 11 cables have been cut in the Baltic in two years, primarily off Finland, with other vessels like the Newnew Polar Bear and Yi Peng 3 also implicated. NATO has launched "Baltic Sentry" to monitor the shadow fleet, which moves Russian oil evading Western sanctions, and safeguard vital seabed infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University are calling for a return to civilized debate in America, emphasizing the urgent need for respectful dialogue. Hunter Kozak, a self-professed liberal who was the last person to speak to Kirk, and Jeb Jacobi, a conservative student volunteer who admired Kirk, both underscored the necessity of civil conversations despite their differing viewpoints. Governor Spencer Cox echoed this sentiment, visiting the campus to promote unity and decry escalating political violence. The article highlights the profound impact of Kirk's murder on those present and the collective responsibility to bridge political divides through constructive engagement rather than succumbing to vengeance or further division.</p>

The "Ultimate Fighter" reality series and captivating matchups helped attract millions of fans, solidifying its mainstream appeal.

          <p>Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing the move is "unlawful" and "provocative." President Trump authorized the deployment to protect federal property, characterizing Portland as "War ravaged" and under siege from "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." Democratic lawmakers, including Governor Tina Kotek, vehemently reject Trump's assertions, stating there is no national security threat or insurrection requiring federal intervention. The article also notes Trump's formal designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, a move legal experts question under First Amendment protections, and highlights concerns about federal agents targeting individuals not posing a danger.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its iconic windmills, plans to implement a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. With an overwhelming 2.6 million tourists annually for a resident population of just 100, the local council aims to control numbers that compromise residents' privacy and the village's authentic charm. Director Marieke Verweij highlighted issues like tourists entering private gardens and peeking into houses. The fee will include admission to the museum and inside the windmills, projected to generate €24.5 million annually for maintenance and new infrastructure. While intended for sustainability, local shop and restaurant owners express significant concerns about losing a substantial portion of their customer base.</p>

          <p>This article examines how the rising popularity of weight-loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro is creating a two-tier system, potentially turning obesity into a wealth issue. While some are now NHS-prescribed, strict eligibility criteria and regional "postcode lotteries" mean thousands miss out, with over 90% of users paying privately at £100-£350 monthly. Pharmaceutical price increases, such as Eli Lilly's Mounjaro, further exacerbate affordability concerns, with some private patients fearing being priced out. Experts worry this trend exacerbates existing health inequalities, as more deprived areas, with higher obesity rates, often have less NHS access. The article highlights a broader debate on medicalizing social issues and the need for food system regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Mets' playoff hopes definitively ended with a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins in their regular-season finale, completing a months-long meltdown. Despite holding the best record in the majors in mid-June with a major league-high $322.6 million payroll, the team dramatically collapsed, going 38-55 afterward and missing the postseason a year after reaching the NLCS. Manager Carlos Mendoza expressed profound frustration, attributing the collapse to the team's poor second-half performance, exacerbated by significant pitching woes following Kodai Senga's hamstring injury. This all-too-familiar outcome for Mets fans, reminiscent of devastating endings in 2007 and 2008, ultimately allowed the Cincinnati Reds to clinch the final NL wildcard spot.</p>

Recent incidents include homeowners discovering pythons in tractor-trailers and backyards, necessitating intervention from Miami-Dade Rescue crews. These non-native snakes, introduced through human activities like the illegal pet trade and exacerbated by changing climate conditions, have no natural predators in Florida and are devastating native wildlife populations, including foxes, rabbits, and raccoons, by competing for food and disrupting ecosystems. The South Florida Water Management District's Python Elimination Program encourages the humane killing of pythons, offering financial rewards, and urges public reporting to curb their unchecked spread.</p>
