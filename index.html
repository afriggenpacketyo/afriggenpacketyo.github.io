          <p>President Trump expressed his intention for the government to continue making deals like the recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel, asserting it will boost the U.S. economy with more jobs and wealth. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett indicated this is part of a broader strategy to establish a sovereign wealth fund, a mechanism primarily used by countries with vast natural resources as funding backstops for transactions. The administration frames this increased federal involvement in private industry as a way to support companies and encourage domestic production. Trump believes such deals will ultimately make the USA "RICHER, AND RICHER."</p>

          <p>Starbucks is bringing back its popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) and other fall-themed items on Tuesday, August 26, marking an earlier seasonal launch than in previous years. The PSL, introduced in 2003, remains the coffee giant's most successful seasonal beverage, having sold hundreds of millions since its debut. This menu refresh, which includes new offerings like Salted Pecan Cream Cold Foam, aims to boost sales and in-store traffic, which have seen recent declines in the U.S. CEO Brian Niccol anticipates the PSL's return will attract a significant number of customers, helping to revitalize the company's performance and address recent sales challenges.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody by ICE in Baltimore, Maryland, after reporting to their office, according to his attorney, who reported ICE officers did not provide a reason for the detention or disclose his destination. This detainment occurred despite a July court order that allowed him to return to Maryland under supervision, while also permitting "lawful immigration proceedings." His legal team has filed a new lawsuit challenging his confinement and potential deportation to Uganda, following his rejection of a plea deal that would have sent him to Costa Rica. His attorneys accuse the federal government of attempting to force a guilty plea.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike hit Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people, including four journalists and one civil defense member, according to health officials. The incident involved a "double-tap" strike, with a second missile hitting moments after the first, as rescue crews arrived on the scene. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the attack, stating they would conduct an initial inquiry and regretted any harm to uninvolved individuals, denying that journalists were specifically targeted. This tragic event adds to mounting international pressure on Israel regarding the high number of journalists killed in its military operations in Gaza, further complicating the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <h2>Top Republican Senator Rejects Trump's Demand to End 'Blue Slip' Tradition for Judicial Nominees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 09:23:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is resisting President Trump's call to eliminate the "blue slip" tradition, which allows senators to veto judicial and U.S. attorney nominees in their home states. Trump argues this longstanding practice obstructs his constitutional right to appoint officials, especially in states with Democratic senators, and urged Grassley to "tell the Democrats, as they often tell us, to go to HELL." Grassley contends that nominees without a blue slip lack the necessary votes for confirmation on the Senate floor or in committee, aiming to set Trump's selections up for success rather than failure. This disagreement highlights an ongoing political battle over judicial appointments and Senate rules within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>A global survey by Gallup and Meta, along with a World Health Organization report, indicates that loneliness is a significant and widespread issue among African youth, with 22 of the 29 countries with the highest prevalence located in Africa. Factors contributing to this include changing family structures due to urbanization, difficulties forming deep connections in diverse environments, and the impact of social media. Poverty and unemployment also exacerbate isolation, while a strong stigma around mental health in many African countries prevents open discussion and seeking help. Experts suggest strengthening family structures, intentional parenting, and implementing mentorship programs as potential solutions to this growing crisis.</p>

          <p>Leaders of South Korea and Japan met in Tokyo, signaling a new era of cooperation aimed at developing "stable, future-oriented" ties in areas like AI, industry, and denuclearization. This diplomatic shift, including scheduled defense minister meetings, is partly driven by the unpredictable foreign policy of U.S. President Donald Trump and closer ties between North Korea/China and Russia. Both nations seek a united front against potential U.S. protectionism and aim to strengthen their alliance, as they are no longer certain the U.S. will meet its obligations as an ally. This article highlights a significant regional diplomatic realignment.</p>

          <p>Scotland, typically known for abundant rainfall, is experiencing severe water scarcity, with rivers reaching critical levels in eastern regions due to the driest spring since 1964 and a hot summer. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is implementing water abstraction restrictions in areas like Ythan and North Fife, which have reached "significant scarcity." Backwater Reservoir, supplying 300,000 people, is less than half full, prompting Scottish Water to consider emergency measures. Experts warn of "weather whiplash" from climate change and advocate for reduced consumption and rainwater harvesting to ensure future water sustainability.</p>

Ukrainian forces successfully intercepted 76 out of 104 incoming drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, demonstrating ongoing defensive efforts. These strikes occur despite recent diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the conflict, which is now in its fourth year, with meetings between U.S., Russian, and Ukrainian presidents having stalled, highlighting persistent hostilities.</p>

Trump is considering expanding these deployments to other Democratic-led cities like Chicago and New York, despite strong pushback from local leaders and claims of improving crime rates.

          <p>Numerous European postal services, including those from France, Germany, and the UK, have suspended most parcel shipments to the U.S., citing widespread uncertainty over new import tariffs announced by President Trump. The executive order, effective August 29, abolishes a tax exemption for small packages worth less than $800, now subjecting them to a 15% tariff. This move is expected to significantly impact small and medium-sized European businesses, which rely on the "de minimis" exemption.

Citing Hannah Arendt, he posits that totalitarian systems replace talent with those whose lack of intelligence guarantees loyalty, creating a "cocoon of flattery."

This change, along with expedited permitting processes, could fundamentally alter how species are protected, impacting vulnerable populations like manatees and jaguars. Scientists estimate that at least 49 listed species could disappear due to losing these protections, including well-known and less charismatic taxa such as mussels and butterflies.

Journalist Danielle Friedman highlights how figures like JFK, the women's movement, and fitness pioneers such as Bonnie Prudden and Jane Fonda challenged outdated beliefs about exercise. The 1970s, with the rise of running, aerobic dancing, yoga, and bodybuilding, marked a significant turning point, commercializing workouts and making fitness aspirational. This cultural shift reflects a uniquely American drive for self-improvement and physical prowess, moving away from past fears of over-exertion.</p>
