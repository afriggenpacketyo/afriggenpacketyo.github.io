            <p>Tom Homan, former Trump White House border czar, defends the administration's decision to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite court orders to facilitate his return to the U.S. Homan alleges Abrego Garcia is a violent MS-13 gang member, a claim disputed by Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family. He also criticizes Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of neglecting victims of MS-13 in his own state. The Supreme Court had unanimously ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return for a trial, which the administration has yet to comply with.</p>

While Garcia has been moved to another prison with better conditions, he still lacks access to news or communication with the outside world.

            <p>President Trump has replaced the acting IRS commissioner, Gary Shapley, just days after appointing him. The new acting head is Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender, according to a statement from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Bessent stated that Shapley remains an important senior advisor at the U.S. Treasury as they work together to rethink and reform the IRS.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that career government employees working on policy matters will be reclassified as "Schedule Policy/Career" employees and will be fired if they don't adhere to his agenda. The administration estimates this rule change would affect around 50,000 employees. These employees will now be considered "at-will" employees, without access to adverse action procedures or appeals, overturning Biden Administration regulations. The White House says this empowers agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles for poor performance, misconduct, corruption, or subversion of Presidential directives.</p>

A recent controversy involves the possible cancellation of an astronomical observatory project between China and a Chilean university, reportedly due to concerns conveyed by the Biden administration. The Trump White House is expected to adopt a more assertive approach to block Sino-Latin American space cooperation, forcing Latin American governments to navigate the competing interests of the two superpowers.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced his administration is taking steps to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The new proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification will affect about 50,000 federal workers, or about 2% of the workforce. The workers "are not required to personally or politically support the President, but must faithfully implement the law and the administration's policies," the White House added. The new rule proposed by OPM is not immediately reclassifying these workers, for the change to happen, Trump will need to sign an executive order after OPM issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>Eurostar trains traveling between London, Paris, and Brussels are experiencing delays ahead of the Easter weekend, with at least one train cancellation and several others delayed by over an hour. Eurostar attributed the disruption to an "overhead power issue" near Paris' Gare du Nord terminal, but initially cited a fire near the tracks as the cause. The company has apologized to affected passengers, stating that all trains are now moving, but delays persist.</p>

            <p>A 19-year-old from Kansas City, Missouri, has been arrested and charged with arson for allegedly burning Tesla vehicles at a dealership. Owen McIntire, a college student in Boston, is accused of damaging two Cybertrucks with a Molotov cocktail on March 17. This arrest follows another recent arrest in New Mexico for similar arson attacks on a Tesla dealership and the Republican Party's state headquarters. These incidents come amid increased vandalism and protests targeting Tesla properties since Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

Trump stated he needs to see "enthusiasm" from both sides to continue the negotiations, while dismissing concerns that he is being played by Russian President Putin. Despite previously claiming he could end the war quickly, Trump now suggests the US may withdraw from the peace process if progress is not made. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the situation is "complicated" but insisted progress had been made.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with efforts to make it easier to fire some federal workers by reclassifying them as "at-will" employees, removing civil service protections. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposed a rule reclassifying tens of thousands of career civil servants, which the White House says will address "unaccountable, policy-determining federal employees who put their own interests ahead of the American people's." The new rule, which renames Schedule F as Schedule Policy/Career, is estimated to affect 50,000 positions, or about 2% of federal workers.</p>

            <p>This article explores the use of humor, particularly black humor, as a coping mechanism and form of resistance against authoritarianism. Drawing on historical examples from Franco's Spain to Communist East Germany, the piece highlights how satire and mockery can undermine the appearance of inevitability that authoritarians depend on. The article also examines the ways in which authoritarian leaders themselves use humor for political purposes, and the challenges of fighting an enemy who is "just kidding." The power of humor is that it acknowledges its own limitations.</p>

Global production of the cheaper Model Y, internally codenamed E41, is expected to begin in the United States, at least a few months later than initially planned. Tesla aimed to produce 250,000 of the cheaper Model Ys in the United States in 2026. The less expensive mass-market vehicles have been widely anticipated by Tesla fans and investors who hope they will attract a fresh group of customers and reverse the EV maker's falling sales and eroding market share.
