          <p>President Trump shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos, claiming they prove his MS-13 membership, but experts dispute this assertion. The tattoos, a leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull, were digitally labeled with gang symbols, raising questions about misleading the public. Experts acknowledge the symbols could have gang-related meanings but are unreliable indicators of membership. Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal record, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador before legal efforts were started to bring him back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has unsealed terrorism charges against Jose Enrique Martinez Flores, an alleged high-ranking member of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. Flores is accused of providing material support to TdA and international drug distribution, and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that TdA is a highly structured terrorist organization that has put down roots in the U.S. during the prior administration. This move contradicts the DOJ's recent arguments for deporting alleged TdA members under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley encountered a room of agitated constituents at a town hall in Northwood, Iowa, with attendees shouting and disagreeing on Trump administration policies. He faced questions about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, with constituents raising concerns about due process. Grassley was booed when he suggested Abrego Garcia's case wouldn't have been an issue if former President Biden had enforced the law. The senator acknowledged the language was stronger than usual and attributed it to strong feelings about Washington.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is attempting to reach numerous individual trade deals to offset the chaos caused by tariffs. Officials are aiming to secure agreements with countries like Japan, South Korea, and India.

The use of tariffs as leverage has created financial strain for businesses and has not brought major trading partners, such as China, to the negotiating table.</p>
