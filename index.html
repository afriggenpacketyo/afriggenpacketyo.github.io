          <p>As students across the UK receive exam results, this article profiles four individuals who achieved their dream careers without attending university. Their paths include becoming a celebrity photographer for stars like Harry Styles, a zookeeper working with lions, a film producer for major television shows, and a self-employed nail technician. These stories illustrate that apprenticeships, self-teaching, and turning hobbies into businesses are viable alternatives to traditional higher education. The individuals advise young people to be patient, use regular jobs to fund their passions, and not feel pressured into a path that isn't right for them, emphasizing hands-on experience as a powerful teacher.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers for California and the U.S. federal government are in court debating the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles during protests. The state argues the deployment violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement, creating fear among civilians. The federal government contends the troops were legally deployed under Title 10 to protect federal property and personnel during what the president termed a "rebellion." The trial is examining whether the troops' actions, such as detaining civilians and setting up roadblocks, constituted prohibited law enforcement activities, with the judge questioning the administration's broad interpretation of presidential authority.</p>

          <p>A study by the National Child Mortality Database reveals that thirteen children under eleven have died from falling out of windows in rental or temporary housing in England since 2019. The report highlights that these deaths are "entirely preventable," citing issues like broken or missing window locks and restrictors, which families had sometimes reported. The findings are echoed by a Housing Ombudsman report likening the scale of window safety defects to problems with damp and mould. With hospital admissions for such falls rising, there are calls for mandatory child-resistant window restrictors in all rented homes to prevent future tragedies, a measure currently under government consultation.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested amid a widening corruption investigation. A Seoul court approved the arrest warrant, citing the risk of evidence destruction, making Yoon and Kim the first former presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously. Investigators suspect Kim of bribery, stock manipulation, and meddling in a political nomination, among other allegations. Her arrest is part of three special prosecutor probes launched by the new liberal government targeting Yoon's conservative presidency. Yoon himself was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief and controversial imposition of martial law in December.</p>

          <p>China's military stated it warned and drove away the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer, that it claims illegally entered its territorial waters near the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Beijing accused the U.S. of seriously infringing on its sovereignty and undermining regional peace and stability. The incident occurred in a hotly contested area, which China calls Huangyan Island, and follows a recent collision between a Chinese warship and a coast guard vessel during a pursuit of a Philippine patrol boat. This confrontation highlights the ongoing tensions in the region, where China asserts broad territorial claims that are disputed by its neighbors and rejected by international arbitration.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon stated that Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has "lost the plot," condemning recent actions in the Gaza conflict as "utterly, utterly unacceptable." Luxon cited the humanitarian crisis, forceful displacement of people, and the recent attack on Gaza City as reasons for his strong criticism. This comes as New Zealand considers officially recognizing a Palestinian state, a move already announced by close allies like Australia, Canada, and the UK. The comments reflect growing international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which several allied nations have described as having reached "unimaginable levels" while calling for unrestricted aid access.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Nature Communications reports that multinational enterprises were responsible for a quarter of the total carbon emissions from all companies in China over a 20-year period. The research, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, highlights a significant yet often overlooked factor in global carbon inequality. According to the findings, the economic benefits of these foreign investments were concentrated in China's eastern coastal regions. However, the heavier environmental burden of the associated emissions was disproportionately borne by the central and western inland areas, raising new questions about assessing carbon responsibility for foreign-owned firms operating within the country.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the profound impact of President Trump's surprise 39% tariffs on Swiss exports, a move that has shattered Switzerland's long-held sense of economic and political isolation. The U.S. is Switzerland's most important export market, and the tariffs threaten to devastate key industries, provoking an identity crisis in a nation built on neutrality and global trade. The author argues that Switzerland has long benefited from being part of the free world without sharing its burdens, a policy that is no longer viable in the current geopolitical climate. The shock has left the Swiss establishment scrambling and may force a re-evaluation of its relationship with the European Union.</p>

Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct import into the Chinese market, joining bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. This development underscores the strengthening agricultural trade ties and increased customs efficiency between the two countries, though some industry insiders remain cautious about the fruit's market competitiveness.</p>

This marks the second major extradition of cartel members in recent months, reflecting increased pressure from the U.S. to dismantle the criminal networks responsible for drug trafficking and violence.

The case was marked by intense legal battles, with the defense arguing Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, while the prosecution maintained she struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss pathways to ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting, set for Friday, follows Trump's unsuccessful push for a ceasefire and comes after he set a deadline for Russia to agree or face more sanctions. The choice of Alaska, purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867, adds historical resonance to the talks, which will be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. While the White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," Trump hopes to urge Putin to end the war, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend in person.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly frozen. The ruling stated the government's suspension of over 300 grants, totaling a significant portion of $584 million in frozen funds, violated a previous court order. The administration had cited alleged discrimination and antisemitism at the university as reasons for the freeze, but the judge found the indefinite suspensions were equivalent to a termination. This decision is a major development in the legal battle between UC researchers and the administration, potentially giving UCLA more leverage against demands for a $1 billion payment to restore all its funding.</p>

One DACA recipient named Edgar, a father of three U.S. citizens, was detained after a traffic stop.

As of Tuesday evening, Erin was moving west with 45 mph winds and does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. However, early models project it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands, though its longer-term path remains uncertain, with most forecasts showing a turn to the northwest.</p>

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer for Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. This offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and argues that an independent Chrome would benefit user safety and the open web. While the bid is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, the company claims to have backing from investors, though some industry analysts have dismissed the offer as a publicity stunt and significantly below Chrome's actual value.

          <h2>Cancer Survival Rates Have Doubled in 50 Years, But Progress is Uneven for Deadliest Types</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that while overall cancer survival has vastly improved over the last 50 years, progress has been starkly uneven, with the deadliest cancers falling further behind. For all cancers combined, half of patients now live for at least ten years, double the rate from the 1970s, with survival for melanoma skin cancer exceeding 90%. However, there has been little improvement for cancers of the pancreas, oesophagus, stomach, and lungs, which all have 10-year survival rates below 20%. Experts attribute the gains to better treatments and earlier detection but warn that the rate of progress has slowed, calling for a renewed focus on the most lethal forms of the disease.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates a challenging landscape for centrist Democrats in New York, with Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holding a 19-point lead over independent candidate Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% support, followed by Cuomo at 25%, Republican Curtis Sliwa at 12%, and incumbent Eric Adams at just 7%. In a hypothetical 2026 gubernatorial race, incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul's lead over Republican Elise Stefanik has narrowed to 14 points. While Mamdani leads with younger voters, Cuomo performs better with Black and Jewish voters, highlighting key demographic divides in the contentious mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed the Smithsonian Institution of a comprehensive review of its 19 museums to ensure exhibits align with a "patriotic" and unifying American story ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. According to a White House letter, the review aims to eliminate what it calls "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from museum content. The initiative will scrutinize everything from exhibition text and artist grants to curatorial processes, giving museums 120 days to replace content deemed divisive. This move follows the recent alteration of an exhibit on presidential impeachments and is part of a broader push to assert oversight over cultural and academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the rollout of ten new live facial recognition (LFR) vans to seven police forces across England, significantly expanding the use of the controversial technology. The vans are equipped with cameras that scan faces in public and compare them against watchlists of wanted individuals, with the government claiming it helps locate suspects for serious crimes like sexual offenses and homicides. However, privacy advocates from groups like Big Brother Watch and Liberty have condemned the move as an alarming expansion of the surveillance state. They argue that a proper legal framework should be established before more of this intrusive technology is deployed on the streets.</p>

The goal is to ensure the 2.4 million people who take the test each year have a basic understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to use a defibrillator. The agency notes that drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest, and immediate intervention can dramatically increase survival rates. Learning materials have already been updated with the new content to encourage all road users to learn these essential emergency skills.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey is now able to learn in person from veteran Keenan Allen, whose practice film he studied extensively before Allen's return to the team. McConkey, who broke Allen's rookie franchise records, says he is constantly picking the veteran's brain to absorb lessons on route running and leveraging defenders. The two are now participating in practice sessions together, with offensive coordinator Greg Roman noting that Allen's presence adds flexibility and strength to the offense. The collaboration between the 33-year-old veteran and the 23-year-old rookie is an exciting prospect for the team's versatile receiver corps.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted the boil water notice for approximately 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. The advisory was in place for a week after a faulty, nearly-closed valve from 1967 disrupted water flow, causing outages and low pressure. After complex repairs, the DWP confirmed the water is now safe to drink following successful testing. The agency is urging residents to thoroughly flush all pipes, faucets, and water-using appliances to clear out any stagnant water or sediment before consumption. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>

In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 report by French and Cameroonian historians, which detailed how French colonial authorities used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement. The acknowledgement is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history, even as critics argue his gestures do not go far enough in addressing past atrocities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers allegedly connected to a string of burglaries targeting high-profile celebrities, including a recent break-in at actor Brad Pitt's home. The suspects, described as street gang members, are believed to be part of a crew that has burglarized the homes of actors and professional athletes. The investigation began after Pitt's Los Feliz home was ransacked in late June when thieves hopped a fence and shattered a window. Police Chief Jim McDonnell noted that burglars are becoming more sophisticated, using surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi jammers, and often target celebrities whose travel schedules are public.</p>
