          <p>Police in Portland, Oregon, are investigating a stabbing that wounded four teenagers at a large, unsanctioned outdoor rave. The incident occurred early Saturday morning during a disturbance in the crowd, which involved hundreds of people. All four victims were conscious at the scene, with two sustaining serious injuries and two minor ones. Authorities have detained one man who was also hospitalized, and they are not currently seeking other suspects but have appealed for witnesses to come forward.</p>

          <p>Witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza report that Israeli troops opened fire on crowds seeking food, killing at least 32 Palestinians near aid distribution centers. The incident occurred near hubs run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was established as an alternative to the UN system. While the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects who approached troops in a closed area, witnesses described indiscriminate fire on civilians. The event highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the dangers surrounding aid distribution in the region.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man experiencing homelessness, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta. Taylor was killed in January when a bulldozer crushed his tent during a city-led sweep of an encampment. The lawsuit alleges that city employees were negligent for failing to check if tents were occupied before clearing the area. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among advocates, who criticize the city's methods for clearing encampments as inhumane, especially as Atlanta prepares to host major events.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch.

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, raising significant health concerns. These discreet pouches, which are currently unregulated by age, deliver a strong nicotine hit and are reportedly causing severe gum damage in users. Health experts and Trading Standards officials are alarmed by the trend, noting that children as young as 11 are buying the products. A proposed Tobacco and Vapes Bill aims to make it illegal to sell these pouches to individuals under 18.</p>

          <p>An initiative touted by the UK government as a major project for "Great British Energy" has equipped its first schools with solar panels manufactured in China. The revelation that the panels came from Chinese firms Aiko and Longi has drawn criticism, particularly due to allegations of forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains.

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with various arguments for and against the change. Proponents suggest a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help mitigate "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, argue the long break is essential for rest and preparation. They also fear that condensing holidays could drive up travel costs and create new logistical challenges for families.</p>

          <p>On the 15th anniversary of her brother's murder, Nishat Siddiqi has made a public appeal for the fugitive suspected of ordering the killing to turn himself in. Her 17-year-old brother, Aamir Siddiqi, was stabbed to death in 2010 in a case of mistaken identity by two contract killers who went to the wrong address in Cardiff. While the hitmen are imprisoned, the man suspected of hiring them, Mohammed Ali Ege, remains one of Europe's most wanted men after escaping custody in India. Nishat urged him to end his life on the run.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy electrified the home crowd at The Open with a dramatic third-round 66, leaving him with a "half-chance" at winning the Claret Jug. His round was filled with highs and lows, including an incredible 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole that generated one of the loudest roars of his career. Despite some missed opportunities and a bizarre incident where his swing unearthed a buried golf ball, McIlroy finished at eight under par. He remains six shots behind the leader but his performance has kept hopes alive for a miraculous final-day comeback.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouins have persisted in southern Syria's Suweida Province, despite a ceasefire announced by the president. Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the violence, which prompted Israeli military intervention in support of the Druze. A US-brokered deal was intended to halt the fighting, but reports indicate continued gunfire and looting in the city of Suweida.

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are deepening their security and political cooperation, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic pivot is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over the United States' long-term commitment to European security. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on security and defense. The E3 alliance signifies a pragmatic shift as Europe's major powers work to bolster their collective defense capabilities, independent of Washington.</p>

          <p>In a research note, Bank of America analysts have described quantum computing as a potential revolution for humanity comparable to the discovery of fire. They argue the technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, could "change everything" by solving currently impossible calculations in an instant. This could accelerate advancements in medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence, potentially leading to an "Artificial Super Intelligence." While major milestones have been achieved, the technology still faces challenges with "noise" and has yet to solve a practical, real-world problem.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler is being remembered as a key moment of German resistance during World War II. Led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, the "Operation Valkyrie" coup attempt failed when the bomb only minorly injured Hitler, leading to the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. Over the decades, the perception of the plotters has shifted from traitors to heroes. The event remains a powerful symbol of defiance against the Nazi regime.</p>
