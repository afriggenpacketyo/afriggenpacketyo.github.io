        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order to give the Department of Defense the secondary title of "Department of War," with the Defense Secretary also being known as the Secretary of War. The administration argues the name change conveys a stronger message of military readiness, harkening back to the name used during the World Wars. While a permanent legal change requires congressional approval, the order will authorize the new name in official communications, reflecting a push to refocus the department on a "warrior ethos."</p>

          <p>The 2025 NFL season began with a startling incident as Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected before the first offensive snap. Carter was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct after video replay showed him spitting on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. The confrontation occurred as officials were addressing a penalty from the opening kickoff, leading to Carter's immediate disqualification from the highly anticipated season opener. The event marked an unusually contentious start to the new football season.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has seen a new level of strategic challenges, with independent candidate Andrew Cuomo calling for debates exclusively with Democrat Zohran Mamdani. In response, Mamdani bypassed Cuomo and challenged President Trump to a debate, framing Cuomo as a puppet for the administration. This development follows reports that the White House is attempting to persuade incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to exit the race, potentially creating a direct contest between Cuomo and Mamdani. Both Adams and Sliwa have publicly stated they have no intention of dropping out.</p>

Geyoro, a highly-rated midfielder, joins a team that is uniquely structured without affiliation to a men's club, aiming to disrupt the established order of women's football in England.</p>

          <p>Two armed Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets conducted a low-altitude flyover of the USS Jason Dunham, a U.S. Navy destroyer, in what Defense Department officials described as a "show of force." The U.S. warship is part of a flotilla deployed to the region for what the Pentagon states are counter-narcotics operations. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of collaborating with drug cartels. Maduro has condemned the U.S. naval presence as a threat.</p>

          <p>While tattoos have entered the mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, a lingering social stigma remains. Research indicates that people with tattoos may still face negative assumptions in professional settings, such as being perceived as less trustworthy. Despite this, tattoos are increasingly embraced as a form of personal expression and art, especially among millennials, over 40% of whom are tattooed. Art institutions are also beginning to recognize tattoo artists, reflecting a broader cultural shift in perception.</p>

The party's success stems from its consolidation of the Brexit vote, attracting socially conservative voters concerned with immigration, equalities policies, and climate change skepticism. While Reform UK benefits from a fragmented political landscape, its long-term viability will depend on retaining its core support and potentially broadening its appeal beyond its niche issues.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced bipartisan criticism during a contentious Senate hearing regarding recent turmoil at the CDC and his vaccine policies. Key moments included Kennedy denying he fired former CDC Director Susan Monarez for disagreeing on vaccine science, instead claiming she was untrustworthy. Several Republican senators, including physicians, challenged Kennedy's actions, expressing concern over his undermining of vaccines and the firing of Monarez just weeks after her confirmation, highlighting deep divisions over U.S. public health leadership.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the blockbuster trade of star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a decision based on "mathematics." Jones stated that the substantial salary required to retain Parsons could instead be allocated to pay for several other top-tier players, improving the team's overall depth and reducing the risk of having a large portion of the salary cap tied to one player. The trade made Parsons the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, a financial commitment Jones felt was better distributed across the roster.</p>

He contrasted Osteen's approach with what he sees as the core responsibilities of a Christian leader, suggesting that Osteen's focus on positive, inspirational messages overlooks essential and challenging aspects of the faith.</p>

          <p>The debate over vaccines in the U.S. has evolved into a broader conflict over government trust, individual freedom, and public health policy, according to this article. This "proxy war" is centered on the sharp policy shifts under HHS Secretary Robert F.

The turmoil, exemplified by the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and contentious hearings, is creating a fragmented system where health regulations increasingly depend on political geography.</p>
