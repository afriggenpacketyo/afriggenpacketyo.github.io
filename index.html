          <p>Researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl salamander in Xochimilco's canals. This method involves filtering water for genetic particles, which is more effective than traditional netting as the population has drastically declined from 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014. While traces of DNA were found primarily in protected refuge areas, their presence offers a slight hope for the species' resilience. Scientists emphasize that conserving the axolotl's habitat is crucial for its survival and brings broader ecological benefits to the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the recent firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, whom Trump accused of manipulating jobs data after a report showed slower-than-expected growth. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy blueprint and a vocal critic of the BLS, must be confirmed by the Senate. The president stated that Antoni will ensure the economic numbers released by the agency are honest and accurate.</p>

          <p>A series of explosions at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant south of Pittsburgh has resulted in at least one fatality and ten injuries, with one employee initially reported as missing. The incident, which occurred in a mechanical regulator room for the coke ovens, prompted a major response from 14 local fire departments and 20 EMS services. The deceased worker was identified as 39-year-old Timothy Quinn. While the plant has been stabilized and a temporary stay-at-home order for nearby residents was lifted, the event has deeply affected the community, drawing responses from state and federal lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Moody's economist Mark Zandi, who believes the U.S. economy is on the verge of a recession, has identified three primary warning signs he is monitoring. The first and most critical indicator is payroll employment, arguing that a consistent decline for more than a month signals a downturn. Secondly, he points to the breadth of job losses across industries, noting that over half of the 400 sectors surveyed reported cuts in July 2025. Finally, Zandi cautions that while unemployment is a factor, it is a lagging indicator and may be a particularly poor barometer in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sheila Jordan, a highly respected and unique voice in jazz, has passed away at the age of 96. Known for her distinctive style and deep connection to the bebop movement, she was a close friend of Charlie Parker, who admired her musical ear. Despite personal hardships and a career that gained momentum later in life, her 1960s album "Portrait of Sheila" remains a classic. Jordan was also a dedicated educator and was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2012, continuing to perform and record well into her nineties.</p>

This move comes after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, alleging without evidence that she had manipulated jobs data following a weak July report. Antoni has been a frequent critic of the BLS's methodology and data collection practices. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is framed by the administration as a step to ensure the release of "HONEST and ACCURATE" economic figures, while critics have raised concerns about politicizing the independent statistical agency.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of over 100 armed gang members. The operation took place early Sunday in the Bukkuyum area after intelligence indicated that a large group of so-called "bandits" was preparing to attack a local village. These armed groups have been responsible for widespread terror, including kidnappings for ransom and imposing illegal taxes on communities. Despite repeated military efforts, the violence persists, contributing to a severe malnutrition crisis as farmers are displaced from their lands.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's decision to declare a crime emergency, federalize the D.C. police, and deploy the National Guard is a political stunt based on false pretenses. The author points out that Trump is using outdated 2023 crime statistics while ignoring significant drops in violent crime and homicides in 2024 and 2025. The move is portrayed not as a genuine effort to improve safety but as a public relations tactic and a dangerous step toward authoritarianism, setting a precedent for using military force in American cities for political gain. The piece contrasts this action with Trump's inaction during the January 6 Capitol attack.</p>

          <p>With the federal government's funding set to expire on September 30, Congress is facing a contentious appropriations battle to avoid a shutdown. The article highlights the political complexities, particularly for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who must unite a narrow Republican majority, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who faces pressure from progressives. A key hurdle remains the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate, which will likely require bipartisan cooperation. Some conservative Republicans are reportedly considering a stopgap measure to maintain current funding levels, arguing it would effectively act as a spending cut.</p>

The Lee fire has burned over 130,000 acres, making it the fifth-largest in state history, and is only 7% contained due to gusty winds and dry fuels. Another blaze, the Elk fire, has scorched 14,000 acres but is 30% contained. Governor Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency for a third fire, while evacuations are in place across multiple counties.

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Productions has signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix, extending their partnership with the streaming giant. However, this new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their previous overall deal from 2020, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content. The couple's projects, including the popular documentary series "Harry & Meghan," have performed well on the platform. Their upcoming slate includes a second season of Meghan's cooking show, a film adaptation of a romance novel, and a documentary short about a Ugandan orphanage.</p>

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey, are facing a fourth day of little to no water service after a 140-year-old water main broke on Friday. The break has left nearly 200,000 customers in Paterson and three neighboring towns under a boil water advisory. Officials have set up portable showers and are distributing bottled water, but many frustrated residents have been forced to find their own solutions. Crews are working on repairs with custom-made pipes and hope to restore service by Tuesday night, though the boil water advisory is expected to last until at least Friday.</p>

The 54-pound meteorite was discovered in the Sahara Desert in Niger in November 2023 and was sold by Sotheby's in New York last month. In response to the sale, Niger's president has suspended all exports of precious stones and meteorites. Sotheby's maintains that the rock was exported in line with all international procedures, but legal experts note that under UNESCO conventions, such objects can qualify as protected cultural property.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. residents have varied opinions on President Trump's decision to federalize the city's police and deploy the National Guard. While protesters and activists denounce the move as an authoritarian power grab intended to silence dissent, some residents in high-crime neighborhoods expressed hope that the increased presence could improve safety. City leaders and many locals remain skeptical, viewing the action as political theater, or "red meat" for Trump's base, that ignores recent significant drops in crime.

He framed the meeting as an initial encounter to gauge if a deal is possible and said he would brief European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy afterward.
