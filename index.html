        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, reflecting a broader societal shift towards individuality. Despite this growing acceptance and their recognition as an art form, some negative perceptions remain, as studies show people with tattoos are sometimes viewed as less trustworthy or hirable. The trend is particularly popular among millennials, with over 40% having tattoos, and it spans across political affiliations, indicating a significant cultural evolution from past generations.</p>

          <p>A school district in DeKalb County, Georgia, is observing positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers at Lakeside High School report that the ban has significantly reduced distractions, leading to more engaged students and an improved learning environment, with a notable decrease in disciplinary issues. This local initiative is part of a growing national trend, as more states enact laws to regulate phone use in schools to combat declining grades and attention spans.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has stated she will not comment on the controversy surrounding her "Great Jeans" campaign with American Eagle during the premiere of her new film, "Christy." The ad, which played on the homophones "genes" and "jeans," drew accusations of promoting eugenics, while others defended it. Sweeney emphasized that her focus at the Toronto International Film Festival will be solely on her movie, in which she portrays former professional boxer Christy Martin, a role that required significant physical transformation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, alleging that the city's sanctuary policies violate federal law by obstructing immigration enforcement. The lawsuit specifically targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits the city's cooperation with federal immigration authorities, with the DOJ claiming these policies endanger public safety. Mayor Wu has defended the city's stance, calling the lawsuit an "unconstitutional attack" and vowing to protect Boston's laws and the rights of its communities.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are set for a mixed opening after the U.S. president formalized a reduction in import tariffs on Japanese automobiles from 27.5% to 15%.

Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures remained stable as investors await the August jobs report, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have pledged to provide post-war security guarantees for Ukraine, which could include an international "reassurance force" on land, sea, and air. This commitment was made following a summit in Paris aimed at solidifying long-term support for Kyiv and securing backing from the U.S. The guarantees are designed to prevent future aggression once the current conflict ends, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailing the agreement as a significant and concrete step forward for his country's security.</p>

          <p>The parents of Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor who died in a flash flood at Camp Mystic, have successfully campaigned for new campground safety legislation in Texas. Following the tragedy that killed over two dozen campers and counselors, the new laws will prohibit cabins in flood zones, mandate warning systems, and require emergency training. The Childress family hopes these changes, passed by the Texas Legislature, will prevent similar preventable deaths and serve as a model for other states to improve safety regulations at camps.</p>

          <p>Political scientist Sir John Curtice analyzes the rapid rise of Reform UK, which has consistently led in polls for five months by capturing a significant portion of the Brexit voter base. The party's success is attributed to its focus on issues like immigration, its critique of equalities policies, and skepticism towards climate change measures, which resonate strongly with former Conservative voters who supported Leave in 2016. While this strategy has built a strong niche, the article questions whether Reform can sustain this momentum and broaden its appeal to win a general election in a fragmented political landscape.</p>

Jones stated that the substantial draft picks received in the trade and the resulting salary cap space will allow the team to afford multiple top-tier players, improving the team's overall depth and on-field availability.</p>

This proposal follows a similar law passed for unincorporated areas of the county and aims to address the growing public health risks posed by extreme heat waves driven by climate change. While advocates emphasize the life-saving potential of the rule, landlord associations have expressed concerns about the high costs of implementation and the potential for increased rents.</p>

Lower courts have blocked the firing, citing federal laws that provide tenure protections to members of certain independent regulatory agencies to shield them from presidential control. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields substantial power, and therefore its commissioners should serve at the will of the president.</p>
