            <p>The US and China are engaged in a heated exchange over tariffs, contributing to significant market volatility. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump awaits China's first move to initiate tariff negotiations, but warned against retaliatory measures. Beijing responded by announcing increased tariffs on all US imports, leading to stock market swings as Trump attempts to reset the bilateral trade relationship. The Chinese Commerce Ministry dismissed Trump's tariffs as a meaningless numbers game, adding to the escalating tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>During his second presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged a large deportation program, and his administration is actively arresting, detaining, and deporting immigrants. However, legal immigrants are also being caught in this crackdown, such as Amir Makled, a U.S. citizen and lawyer, who was detained by Border agents at a Detroit airport upon returning from a family vacation. The NPR article explores how the Trump administration's immigration policy is changing who is getting arrested and detained, highlighting the broader impact on both legal and illegal immigrants. Optimism score of 30 because, while negative for immigrants, this is simply the expected policy from the Trump administration.</p>

His last official checkup revealed high cholesterol, rosacea, and being overweight, but he appeared to be in "excellent" cardiovascular shape for his age.

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), slashing its overall budget by more than 25%. The proposed cuts would severely impact NOAA's research operations, fisheries services, and satellite technology. If enacted, these cuts would regress the agency's scientific capabilities and limit its ability to provide critical weather and climate services. The cuts would align with the conservative policy blueprint outlined in Project 2025.</p>
