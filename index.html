          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial redistricting bill. The proposed map, backed by Donald Trump, could create several new Republican-held congressional seats, a move Democrats argue is an effort to rig future elections. The Democratic lawmakers traveled to other states to draw national attention to the issue, while Texas Republicans authorized law enforcement to compel their return, though the warrants have no legal power outside of Texas.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced plans to use a South Florida migrant detention center, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for a new national strategy. The plan involves establishing similar state-run facilities near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to expedite the processing and deportation of unauthorized migrants. The approach has drawn legal challenges and criticism from attorneys over concerns about constitutional rights, inhumane conditions, and the legality of state-run immigration detention.</p>

The trip, hosted by a pro-Israel advocacy group, drew immediate condemnation from the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described it as a violation of international law that undermines peace efforts. Johnson's visit is the most significant by a U.S. official since 2020 and occurs amid growing international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has proposed a pilot program that would require some tourist and business visa applicants to post bonds of up to $15,000. The policy targets individuals from countries with high rates of overstaying visas or with inadequate document security. This measure is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to tighten immigration and visa requirements. While the program aims to ensure compliance with visa terms, it has raised concerns about making travel unaffordable for some applicants.</p>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public appeal for people to donate their unwanted but healthy pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, to be used as food for its carnivores. The zoo stated that this practice helps imitate the natural food chain for its predators, like lions and tigers, and provides a more natural diet. The animals are "gently euthanised" by trained staff, and the zoo explains that this is a common practice in Denmark for making use of animals that would otherwise be put down.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has demanded that police release the immigration status of criminal suspects, following the arrest of two men in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online conspiracy theories, referencing the aftermath of a deadly attack in Southport last year. His call comes after it was reported, but not officially confirmed, that the two men charged in the Nuneaton case are Afghan nationals, prompting a debate over police disclosure policies.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified the bacterium *Vibrio pectinocida* as the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of sunflower sea stars along the West Coast since 2013. The epidemic caused a 94% decline in the global population of this keystone species, leading to an explosion of sea urchins and the decimation of vital kelp forests. This scientific breakthrough provides a clear path forward for conservation efforts, including developing diagnostic tests and breeding disease-resistant sea stars to help restore marine ecosystems.</p>

The move aims to make the national awards more inclusive and representative of the entire country, following analysis that showed a disproportionate number of higher awards go to people in southern England. Ms. Mannings will lead efforts to encourage a wider range of nominations from under-represented regions and backgrounds to ensure the system celebrates excellence from all walks of life.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order in a Louisiana redistricting case suggests the conservative majority may be preparing to invalidate key protections against racial gerrymandering under the Voting Rights Act. The Court has asked for briefings on whether a lower court's order to create a second Black-majority district is unconstitutional, signaling a potential reversal of long-held precedent. This move could dismantle one of the few remaining legal tools to challenge gerrymandered maps, potentially allowing states to further dilute the voting power of racial minorities.</p>
