          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy. These claims include assertions that wind turbines are killing whales and birds, are not truly green due to recycling issues, and provide inconsistent energy efficiency. The article cites scientific evidence and reports from organizations like NOAA Fisheries and the US Fish & Wildlife Service to refute these claims. It clarifies that while wind turbines do contribute to bird deaths, they are a relatively small factor compared to other causes like cats and building collisions, and that recycling efforts for wind turbine components are improving.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly taking a more aggressive approach to addressing antisemitism, initiating investigations and imposing sanctions on universities. Harmeet Dhillon, DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, emphasized that there is no conflict between combating antisemitism and protecting First Amendment rights. The DOJ is focusing on violent rhetoric and acts, such as blocking Jewish students and destroying property, rather than criticizing the Israeli government. This initiative follows a spike in anti-Jewish incidents after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, with the administration also targeting non-citizen students accused of supporting Palestinian causes.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the timeline of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March 2025. Despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, the Trump administration deported Garcia, claiming he was a member of MS-13, which his family denies. The timeline details subsequent court battles, including a Supreme Court ruling, and the administration's initial resistance to facilitating his return. Ultimately, Garcia was indicted for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants and brought back to the U.S. to face charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, using the Delaware State Housing Authority's program as an example. The Delaware program includes a seven-year time limit, a work requirement, and a savings incentive, where tenants can save extra money and access it when they move out. While some experts support time limits to encourage turnover and upward mobility, others worry about the consequences for those who cannot find affordable housing. The Tacoma Housing Authority in Washington state ended its time limit program after finding that people without time limits fared better at increasing their incomes.</p>

In Baisha, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain, reflecting this trend. Chinese liquor brands are innovating to appeal to younger consumers, who prioritize self-indulgent experiences over social rituals.

However, Musk's role in the Trump administration has been more complex, with his influence in areas like deregulation and anti-woke initiatives being less prominent than expected.

          <p>This New York Times editorial argues that the Trump administration is characterized by a culture of corruption, where individuals who enrich Trump and his family receive preferential treatment.

The article claims that Trump has shifted from skepticism towards cryptocurrency to actively promoting it after his family became major players in the market.

          <p>A report finds that forgotten 401(k) accounts can incur fees that significantly reduce retirement savings. Former employees who leave their 401(k) with their previous employer may be charged maintenance fees, eroding their principal and lost compounding interest. While rolling over into an IRA is an option, IRAs typically have higher investment fees. The Department of Labor has created a retirement savings lost and found database to help workers find old retirement plans, and updating contact information with former employers can also help.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's plan to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., and argues that it could be a positive event. While acknowledging concerns about Trump's potential misuse of the military, the author suggests that a parade could help counter misperceptions about the armed forces and boost recruitment. With the military facing a shrinking pool of qualified recruits, a celebratory parade could familiarize civilians with military service and inspire talented young Americans to join.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's investigation into Joe Biden's cognitive decline is a misuse of the Department of Justice and a potential path to expanding presidential immunity. While the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States grants presidents immunity for "official" acts, it may encourage retaliatory investigations and protect not only the president but also his aides. The author suggests that this investigation could be used to set a precedent for shielding Trump's own criminal activity.</p>
