            <p>Post Malone headlined the first weekend of Coachella, performing a 90-minute set that reimagined his pop-rap hits with a country twist, a genre he officially entered in 2024. Dressed in jeans and a ball cap, Malone played twangy versions of songs like “Texas Tea” and “Wow,” creating a Stagecoach-like atmosphere. He also performed solo renditions of country songs from his album, although he refrained from bringing out any surprise guests. Malone concluded his set with a motivational speech and the song “Congratulations,” reflecting on his journey from being labeled a one-hit wonder to becoming a country star.</p>

Despite criticism for human rights abuses under his state of emergency, Bukele is admired for reducing homicides and enjoys high approval ratings at home, further solidifying his alliance with MAGA Republicans.</p>

            <p>Major stock markets in Asia and Europe experienced gains following the U.S. announcement of temporary tariff exemptions on key consumer electronics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led the surge, while European markets also saw significant increases. Despite the positive market reaction, President Trump indicated that the tariff reprieve would be temporary, suggesting that specific tariffs would be imposed on goods under a new national security classification. The exemptions included smartphones, computers, and other electronics, offering temporary relief to tech companies concerned about the tariffs on goods from China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A report by UK Members of Parliament (MPs) investigated the policing response to riots that erupted following the fatal stabbing of three children in Southport. While the report found police forces were unprepared for the violence, it deemed their response appropriate, rejecting claims of 'two-tier policing'. The MPs commended the bravery and professionalism of officers, many of whom were injured, but highlighted the need for better anticipation of disorder. The report also addressed the role of misinformation in spreading the riots, recommending updates to the Crown Prosecution Service's media protocol.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, citing the possibility of zero growth this year after a lower-than-expected GDP expansion in the first quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 due to declines in manufacturing and some service sectors. The ministry also noted that sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S., as well as the U.S.-China trade war, will likely deteriorate the growth outlook for both countries. The Monetary Authority of Singapore will reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band.</p>

Despite the export surge, trade policies remain uncertain, posing challenges for businesses adjusting supply chains.

            <p>President Trump criticized CBS News and its parent company, Paramount, following a '60 Minutes' broadcast that featured interviews and segments critical of his policies. Trump called for 'maximum fines and punishment' against the network, accusing it of being a 'dishonest Political Operative' disguised as news. He specifically targeted segments on Greenland and the war in Ukraine, urging the FCC to impose 'substantial' penalties on CBS for what he deemed 'unlawful and illegal behavior.' The segments included an interview with Zelensky and critical remarks from Greenlanders about Trump's interest in acquiring the territory.</p>

            <p>A retrial has commenced in Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of defaming her in a 2017 editorial. Palin alleges that the editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation and career. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but maintains it was an 'honest mistake' that was quickly corrected. The retrial follows an appeals court decision that restored the case, citing errors in the original trial. The case unfolds amid heightened tensions between political figures and media outlets.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG investors should re-evaluate their stance on oil and gas companies, similar to how mission-driven funds have reconsidered defense policies after the Russia-Ukraine war. The firm argues that the energy transition will be longer than expected, requiring new oil and gas development into the 2040s. Goldman also highlights that oil and gas companies are significant investors in low-carbon energy and possess market-making and risk-taking capabilities crucial for the transition. However, some argue that oil and gas stocks should not be favored given the negative climate impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Baby boomers and first-time travelers are driving a trend towards 'coolcations,' avoiding Europe's summer hotspots due to extreme heat, cost, and overcrowding. Popular destinations like Italy, Greece, and Spain are losing appeal in July and August, with travelers opting for cooler climes in northern Europe. Bookings to Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia have increased significantly, while bookings to southern Europe have shifted to shoulder seasons. This trend reflects a growing awareness of climate change and a desire for more temperate vacation experiences.</p>
