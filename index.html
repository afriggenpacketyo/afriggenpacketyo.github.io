          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated a project to convert a two-kilometer expressway in the Ginza district into an elevated greenway, named the Tokyo Sky Corridor, expected to be completed by the 2040s. This redevelopment aims to replace the existing Tokyo Expressway, also known as the "KK Line," with a pedestrian-friendly promenade featuring trees, flowers, benches, and public restrooms. The project, inspired by New York City's High Line, intends to create a new tourist attraction with cafes and food trucks, but faces challenges such as managing summer heat and ensuring the structure can support the added weight of soil and plant life. The estimated cost is 14 billion yen ($97 million), potentially increasing due to rising material prices.</p>

          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, after initially wanting to leave. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Dyer explained that the letter made him realize the pain he was causing his family due to his addiction and the toxic nature of fame. Dyer, known for his role in EastEnders, admitted to making bad decisions and excessive drug use earlier in his career, but has since turned his life around, citing his family and his role in the show as key turning points. He emphasized the far-reaching impact of addiction on loved ones, not just the individual struggling with it.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' perfect record against former Cy Young Award winners ended with a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a strong pitching performance from Dustin May. Corbin Burnes, the Diamondbacks' pitcher, threw seven shutout innings, marking his best performance since joining the team and earning the Diamondbacks the win. May pitched well, but mistakes led to Arizona's runs, while Burnes effectively shut down the Dodgers' offense, stranding runners and limiting hits. This loss also highlighted the Dodgers' recent struggles against teams with winning records, as they have lost nine of their last twelve games against such opponents.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating conflict between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration, initially hesitant, intervened to prevent a potential nuclear war. Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio engaged with leaders from both countries after evidence suggested the conflict was spiraling out of control, including Pakistani air force activity near its nuclear arsenal. The intervention involved direct calls from Vance to Prime Minister Modi and Rubio to General Munir, urging de-escalation and proposing alternatives to continued strikes. President Trump announced a cease-fire, with Pakistan acknowledging American involvement while India remained silent on the matter.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine to begin as early as May 15 in Istanbul, aiming to address the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace. This proposal followed a visit by European leaders to Ukraine, who urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and threatened new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if the ceasefire was not accepted. Putin indicated that these talks could potentially lead to new ceasefires and truces, while Kyiv has not yet responded to the invitation. Moscow has previously stated that the West must cease its military aid to Ukraine before a ceasefire can be considered.</p>

Speaking at a town hall in Pennsylvania, Gallego cited Joe Rogan as an example of someone the party effectively "canceled" due to ideological disagreements. Gallego, who won his Senate race in a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need for alliances with those who may not agree with the party 100% of the time.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing potential strain on the country's finances. While opposition parties advocate for a consumption tax cut ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative support methods for those in need. He also stated that Japan would continue to seek the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States. The Prime Minister's remarks come amidst debate between government officials and members of the ruling coalition regarding the feasibility and impact of a consumption tax reduction.</p>

Following the incident, wildlife officials killed three adult male bears in the area, and necropsy results confirmed that one of the bears had consumed partial remains of the victim. The incident occurred in an area with a significant bear population, and while bear attacks are rare in Florida, officials advise caution, especially when cubs, food sources, or dogs are present.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, a Maryland oral surgeon, was convicted of depraved-heart murder in the overdose death of his 25-year-old girlfriend, Sarah Harris. Harris's sister, Rachel, uncovered a trove of text messages revealing Ryan's provision of dangerous drugs to Harris, who struggled with mental health issues and addiction. Detective Ian Iacoviello, an expert in pharmaceutical investigations, recognized the texts as evidence of a slow-motion murder, highlighting Ryan's control over Harris through drugs. Prosecutors successfully argued that Ryan acted with reckless disregard for Harris's life by providing her with habit-forming anesthetics and tranquilizers, leading to a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its southwestern province of Yunnan is playing a key role in agricultural cooperation with Southeast Asian nations. Yunnan's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. With China's rising demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation are seen as effective ways to support the country's food security. Changing food consumption patterns in China, with increased demand for meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, further drive the need for diversified food sources.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr has announced his retirement from the NFL due to a labral tear and degenerative changes in his right shoulder. Carr, a four-time Pro Bowler, played for 11 seasons and was entering the third year of a $150 million contract with the Saints. The Saints will now look to Tyler Shough, their second-round draft pick, to compete for the starting quarterback position, along with Spencer Rattler and Jake Haener. Coach Kellen Moore expressed confidence in the younger quarterbacks and did not rule out bringing in a veteran QB through free agency.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is expected to experience an unusual atmospheric river event, bringing widespread rainfall and potential flooding to Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated spots potentially receiving up to 12 inches. While atmospheric rivers typically impact the Western U.S., a cutoff low is diverting this event eastward, potentially alleviating drought conditions in some areas. However, the heavy rainfall also poses a risk of flooding in low-lying areas, prompting officials to urge residents to take necessary precautions.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine, suggesting that negotiations should resume in Istanbul on May 15 to achieve a durable peace and address the root causes of the war. Putin's proposal came after European leaders threatened increased sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. While Putin did not directly address the ceasefire request, he indicated that negotiations could lead to new truces, but also reiterated demands for NATO's non-expansion and Ukraine's exclusion from the alliance, conditions previously rejected by Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the US-Canada border are feeling the economic sting of Trump's trade war, with a significant drop in Canadian visitors. Border crossings between the US and Canada have decreased by approximately 17% since Trump began implementing tariffs, causing economic hardship for towns reliant on cross-border traffic. Businesses in these areas, already impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, are now facing further challenges as Canadians increasingly choose to "Buy Canadian" and reduce travel to the US. Duty-free shops and restaurants near the border have experienced substantial sales declines, highlighting the interconnected nature of these economies.</p>

The judge stated that her detention could chill free speech, and the government had not provided enough evidence for her detainment besides the pro-Palestinian opinion essay. Ozturk's lawyers emphasized that her asthma worsened while in detention, but her release was briefly delayed when the government sought to make her wear an ankle monitor, prompting Judge Sessions to issue a second order.</p>
