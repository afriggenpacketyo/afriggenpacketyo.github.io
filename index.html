          <p>A federal judge awarded over $680,000 to 17 families affected by the 2021 jet fuel leak into a Navy drinking water system in Hawaii. The awards, ranging from $5,000 to over $104,000 per family, serve as bellwether cases for thousands of other pending lawsuits. While the government admitted liability for the spill, they contested the extent of the health impacts. Families reported symptoms like dizziness, rashes, and neurological issues after the fuel contaminated water supplied to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, leading to the eventual draining and closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.</p>

          <p>Harvard University faces a financial crisis as the Trump administration threatens to withhold federal grant money, potentially forcing the institution to rethink its identity and scale. The university, which received $687 million in federal research money in 2024, is challenging the funding freeze in court but is also considering alternative options, including private fundraising. Harvard has already implemented a hiring freeze and layoffs, and the Research Continuity Committee is exploring non-federal funding sources. While the Harvard Corporation is currently resisting negotiations with the Trump administration, some officials are contemplating a settlement to mitigate further damage.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by George H.W. Bush, passed away at 85, leaving behind a legacy as a key member of the court's liberal wing.

Throughout his tenure, Souter viewed the Constitution as a charter of ‚Äúordered liberty,‚Äù evolving over time to encompass concepts like the right to privacy. Despite his wealth and Ivy League education, Souter maintained an ascetic lifestyle, preferring privacy and intellectual pursuits over Washington's social scene.</p>

While the risk of human impact is low, the spacecraft's robust construction, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, raises concerns about its potential survival through re-entry.

          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists indicates that the severe storms in the central Mississippi Valley in early April, which caused 24 deaths, were made more likely and intense by burning fossil fuels. The study found that human-caused climate change increased the rainfall intensity by about 9% and the likelihood of such storms by 40%. Warmer ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, driven by the climate crisis, contributed to the storm's moisture.

          <p>President Trump described the U.S.-Canada border as an "artificially drawn line" during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, suggesting it should be erased. Historians argue that this characterization downplays the border's complex history and significance in everyday life. While the border was indeed created through treaties and mostly follows the 49th parallel, it has real-world consequences and is actively monitored. The U.S.-Canadian border is the longest international border in the world, stretching 5,525 miles across North America.</p>
