          <p>A 38-year-old woman died in Thessaloniki, Greece, after an explosive device she was carrying detonated. Police reported that the woman was known to authorities for prior robberies and believe she intended to plant the device at a bank ATM. The explosion occurred when the device malfunctioned in her hands, leading to fatal injuries sustained at the hospital. Authorities are also investigating possible links between the woman and extreme leftist groups to determine the extent of her involvement and potential motives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William is reportedly unwilling to welcome Prince Harry back into the royal family due to Harry's public criticisms of the monarchy. Hilary Fordwich and Ian Pelham Turner suggest that the rift between the brothers has widened, particularly after Harry's recent BBC interview. Harry has expressed a desire for reconciliation, especially given King Charles's cancer diagnosis, but admitted his father "won't speak to me because of this security stuff." Royal experts suggest that Harry has not expressed any regrets regarding his own behavior, which is hypocritical.</p>

          <p>A recent impact assessment in England and Wales estimates that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths in the tenth year after its legalization. The report, intended to inform MPs debating the bill, also projects NHS savings ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m annually after a decade, due to reduced healthcare costs for those choosing assisted dying. However, the cost of staffing and training for the service could exceed Â£10m annually. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, emphasizes the human cost, while opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election amidst concerns over potential tariffs imposed by the United States and rising living costs. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's People's Action Party (PAP), which has been in power since 1965, faced a challenge from the opposition Workers' Party (WP), which seeks greater scrutiny and alternative voices in Parliament. Wong emphasized the need for a strong mandate to navigate economic uncertainty, while the WP highlighted the cost of living crisis. The PAP has historically dominated Singaporean politics, but recent elections have shown a slight decline in their popular support.</p>

          <p>BBC reporter Nada Tawfik reflects on her exclusive interview with Prince Harry, noting his down-to-earth demeanor and eagerness to share his feelings despite ongoing scrutiny. The interview took place in California, following Harry's loss of an appeal regarding his security in the U.K. Tawfik describes pressing Harry on why taxpayers should fund his security and his perspective on the risks he faces. The article emphasizes the importance of providing Harry a platform to express his views and raise questions for public consideration. She felt it was important to ask why taxpayers should pay for his security, why a change of status wasn't warranted given he wasn't a working royal, and why protection on a case-by-case basis made him feel at greater risk.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the U.S. economy is facing challenges, as indicated by a contraction in GDP during the first quarter. Trump attributes any negative economic indicators to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while taking credit for positive reports. Growth in the first quarter was significantly affected by the new administration's trade policies, leading to increased imports and decreased consumer spending. The erratic implementation of tariffs has created confusion and uncertainty, potentially setting the stage for a recession. The article notes that Trump's strategic uncertainty during trade negotiations may have negative consequences for businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as a complex global landscape influenced by the United States and China, according to this article. Voters express concerns about rising costs, but neither major party has proposed ambitious solutions. Opposition leader Peter Dutton has focused on cost-of-living issues, while Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasizes healthcare. The election also reflects cultural divisions and a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, as voters seek deeper solutions to pressing issues.</p>

          <p>The blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has led to the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown the ability to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Current antivenom therapies must match the specific species of venomous snake involved in a bite. This mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate political power under the Communist Party. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. This overhaul is expected to address issues created by the party's anti-corruption campaign and external pressures, such as potential U.S. tariffs. To Lam, the country's new party chief, is spearheading the changes, which are also seen as a way to strengthen centralized governance and exert more direct control over local affairs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado, Denver, and local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit claims these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The suit specifically references a controversial apartment complex in Aurora and accuses Colorado's policies of enabling criminal activity. The governor's office and the Denver mayor's office have responded, with the city vowing to defend its values and follow all applicable laws. The suit is similar to those filed against Chicago and Rochester, New York.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. The new tariff aims to push carmakers to manufacture more in the US, but analysts predict it will lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. General Motors anticipates significant new costs due to the tariffs, while other companies have withdrawn financial guidance due to market uncertainties. Some exemptions apply to parts made in Mexico and Canada, providing limited relief to companies.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the U.S. is impacting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The loophole's expansion had previously fueled the rise of low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein, leading to a surge in digital advertising spending. Now, with tariffs of up to 145 percent, companies like Temu have stopped shipping directly from China, transitioning to local warehouses. This shift is expected to reduce advertising spending and impact the visibility of these apps.</p>

The project, intended to fulfill a personal pledge by former President Nana Akufo-Addo, has been stalled due to a severe economic crisis and allegations of corruption. The new government has halted funding and dissolved the agency managing the project, and the unbuilt cathedral has become a target of an anticorruption initiative. Critics argue that the funds could be better used to address pressing economic needs.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which could significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump, aim to promote domestic manufacturing, but may lead to higher costs for consumers. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of a North American trade agreement. While some exemptions have been granted, automakers and suppliers express concerns about the long-term impact on the industry.</p>
