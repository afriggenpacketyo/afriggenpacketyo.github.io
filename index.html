        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Model Christie Brinkley, who has been married four times, recently shared her perspective on the longevity of modern marriages. During a podcast appearance, she suggested the idea of marriage contracts that could be renewed every five years, allowing couples to reassess their relationship without complex legal battles. Brinkley reflected on her own experiences, admitting she has been a "fool for love" and that some of her past relationships made her feel unloved. She also discussed how writing her memoir required her to revisit difficult periods, such as divorces, to make the book relatable for readers who have faced similar challenges.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead solution." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that the nation will not surrender land to the occupier. Zelenskyy's comments highlight Ukrainian concerns about being marginalized in direct U.S.-Russia negotiations, especially following Trump's suggestion that a deal might involve "some swapping of territories." The statement underscores Kyiv's insistence on being a central party in any resolution to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White as the suspected gunman in a fatal shooting near the Emory University campus and the CDC headquarters in Atlanta. The incident resulted in the deaths of the suspect and DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, who was killed in the line of duty. The attack prompted a massive law enforcement response and a shelter-in-place order for the university campus, with several CDC buildings being struck by bullets. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, and officials have praised the swift actions of first responders in containing the threat.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured early Saturday morning following a dispute that began inside a restaurant. According to the NYPD, a 19-year-old male, an 18-year-old female, and a 65-year-old man were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Witnesses reported that a fight involving a group of teens spilled out onto the street, leading to the gunfire. Police have taken a 17-year-old suspect into custody and recovered a firearm from the scene, though it was not immediately clear if the victims were the intended targets of the altercation.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Haley Amaya, a 27-year-old Los Angeles-born model of Honduran descent who is dedicated to preserving her cultural roots through dance. Growing up in Koreatown, she used art as an escape and a way to build her identity, eventually founding the "Cinco Estrellas" ballet to offer free Honduran folkloric dance classes to younger generations. Despite her success in the competitive modeling industry, Amaya considers herself a cultural ambassador, using her platform to empower her community and speak out on issues like immigration raids. Her story highlights the power of art to connect individuals to their heritage and provide a positive outlet for youth.</p>

The government banned the group in July following incidents of serious criminal damage, making support for it punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The event highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding activism related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the legal boundaries of protest in the UK.</p>

In his latest book, he argues that his original, highly conservative rule can be updated, suggesting retirees can safely withdraw more than initially calculated. Bengen now recommends a withdrawal rate closer to 5.25% to 5.5% for current retirees, citing the benefits of a more diversified portfolio that includes small-cap and international stocks. He emphasizes that his research aims to help retirees enjoy their accumulated wealth without the pervasive fear of outliving their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, she had unique access to exotic specimens, which she combined in compositions that elevated nature.

This proposal has drawn widespread condemnation from humanitarian agencies and world leaders, who fear it will cause immense suffering.

          <p>In a sign of de-escalating tensions, North Korea has started removing propaganda loudspeakers along its border with South Korea, according to Seoul's military. The move follows South Korea's own dismantling of speakers and halting of broadcasts shortly after the election of President Lee Jae Myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. For years, both sides have used the speakers to broadcast messages, K-pop music, and unsettling noises across the demilitarized zone, a practice that had recently resumed.

A recent state audit found the agency's inspectors often failed to take proper action, and a review of cases showed few penalties were issued even when deaths occurred.

          <p>An opinion piece remembers Sandra Grimes, the dedicated CIA analyst who played a pivotal role in unmasking one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, Aldrich Ames. In 1991, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs revealed a pattern linking Ames's meetings with a Soviet official to large cash deposits in his bank account. Her work was crucial to the 1994 arrest of Ames, who had compromised numerous intelligence assets. Grimes, who passed away recently at 79, is remembered for her persistence and dedication.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by separating its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business. In a letter, Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, undervaluing it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm contends that the high-growth, high-margin DAT segment is a "hidden gem" whose value is suppressed by the main communications business. Carronade suggests a spin-off or IPO of the DAT unit could lead to a significant increase in the company's overall valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's Economic Policies Align with 'Degrowth' Ideology</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump's second-term economic policies effectively amount to a form of "degrowth," an ideology focused on reducing production and consumption. The author points to high tariffs, which raise consumer prices and suppress demand, along with cuts to government subsidies for necessities like healthcare, education, and renewable energy. The article contends that these actions, combined with attacks on scientific research and a reduction in immigration, are weakening the U.S. economy, shrinking production, and lowering productivity, ultimately making Americans worse off despite promises of economic strength.

          <p>Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a deadly shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been captured following a weeklong manhunt. Authorities say Brown killed four people at The Owl Bar on August 1 before fleeing into the surrounding mountains. His arrest was the result of an extensive law enforcement effort involving around 130 officers. Brown, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, reportedly struggled with mental illness, according to his family and local residents. The victims were identified as regular patrons of the bar, and the community is mourning their loss.</p>

          <p>In a major diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes normalized relations and reopens key transportation routes, including a transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be known as the "Trump Route." Both Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised President Trump's role in facilitating the breakthrough. The agreement marks a significant geopolitical shift, reducing Russia's long-standing influence as a mediator in the South Caucasus.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's newly launched GPT-5 model is receiving a mixed reception in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI touted its latest model as its smartest and fastest yet, with PhD-level expertise and built-in "thinking" functions, some Chinese tech experts have been less impressed. One prominent AI blogger described GPT-5 as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs or memorable characteristics. The lukewarm reviews come as Chinese tech companies are rapidly developing their own advanced AI models, highlighting the heightened competition and high expectations within the industry for truly groundbreaking advancements.</p>

          <p>A family's fishing trip in the Everglades turned into a nightmare when the undocumented father was arrested and sent to a controversial makeshift detention center dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The man, from El Salvador, and his Guatemalan wife were arrested for not having driver's licenses; she was released with their baby, but he was detained. The state-run facility, designed to hold what officials call "the most menacing migrants," has been criticized by human rights groups for its harsh conditions, including extreme heat and lack of water. The story highlights the human impact of the administration's immigration policies and the difficulties families face navigating the detention system.</p>

          <p>A wave of protests is occurring across the UK in response to the government's use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. In towns like Epping, Essex, local residents, including mothers and professionals with little history of activism, are organizing demonstrations, citing fears for community safety, particularly for women and children. While some far-right activists are present, the movement appears to be driven by broader local concerns and frustration with government policy. The protests highlight a growing tension between local communities and the central government's secretive and costly asylum accommodation strategy, which has been criticized for a lack of transparency.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County Fire Department captain, Thomas Merryman, is facing multiple felony charges for allegedly faking a work injury to fraudulently collect over $25,000 in disability insurance payments. Prosecutors claim Merryman, 45, submitted forged paperwork, including a doctor's note and documents under another captain's name, to support his claim for an injury that could not have occurred because he was not at work. The L.A. County District Attorney's office has charged him with insurance fraud, forgery, and false personation. If convicted, he could face up to five years in state prison for abusing the system.</p>
