          <p>A theory called 'winology,' gaining traction on Chinese social media and in academic circles, posits that the West, particularly the United States, unfairly dismisses China's economic and technological achievements. This viewpoint, originating from Chinese academics, suggests a hierarchical world view is responsible for this perceived bias against China's rise as a global leader. The theory is now the subject of formal academic discussions at institutions like Wuhan and Fudan University, indicating its growing intellectual influence within the country.</p>

          <p>Construction has commenced on a new, privately funded grand ballroom at the White House, beginning with the demolition of parts of the East Wing's covered entryway. President Trump announced the $250 million project, which he says will be funded by 'generous Patriots' and will not interfere with the main historic structure. However, former National Park Service historian Robert K. Sutton has expressed concern over the lack of a rigorous public review process for such a significant alteration to the iconic building.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has granted state-run oil company Petrobras a license to drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River, a decision that has drawn severe criticism from environmental activists. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration supports the project, arguing the revenue will help fund the country's climate transition and ensure energy sovereignty. Environmental groups have condemned the move as a 'sabotage' of the upcoming COP30 climate summit in Brazil, warning of potential risks to the rainforest and its Indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, 'Spacewoman,' chronicles the pioneering career of Eileen Collins, who made history as the first woman to pilot and command a NASA Space Shuttle. The film explores her journey from a young girl inspired by the Gemini astronauts to a determined Air Force test pilot who broke barriers in the space program. Collins reflects on the immense pressure she faced, including commanding the critical 'return to flight' mission after the 2003 Columbia disaster, where she executed a risky in-orbit maneuver to ensure the shuttle's safety.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, 82, has completed a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive, high-risk form of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in May. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared a video of him ringing a ceremonial bell at the University of Pennsylvania's oncology clinic, a tradition marking the end of a treatment phase. The news follows a September procedure where Biden had skin cancer lesions removed, and comes as concerns over his health were a central issue during the 2024 campaign, which he ultimately exited.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey have filed motions to dismiss the federal indictment against him, arguing the charges are an 'egregious abuse of power' driven by President Trump's 'personal animus.' The legal team asserts that Trump ordered the prosecution due to personal spite and Comey's public criticism of him. The filings also challenge the appointment of the interim U.S. Attorney who signed the indictment, claiming she was defectively appointed to enable the charges against an outspoken critic of the president.</p>

          <p>According to the co-author of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, Giuffre would have considered Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his royal titles a significant victory in her quest for accountability. The memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' details Giuffre's allegations of being sexually trafficked to the prince by Jeffrey Epstein, which Andrew has consistently denied. The co-author, Amy Wallace, stated that while the gesture is symbolic, it represents a step toward holding powerful men accountable for their past behavior and that Giuffre wanted all those involved to face consequences.</p>

This real-world data confirms the effectiveness of a landmark 2015 clinical trial and highlights the public health impact of changing infant feeding practices to prevent life-threatening food allergies.</p>
