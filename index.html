          <p>Harvey Weinstein was convicted of engaging in a criminal sex act with Mimi Haley but acquitted of a similar charge involving Kaja Sokola in his New York retrial. The jury, however, was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of rape involving Jessica Mann and will continue deliberations. Weinstein, who pleaded not guilty, maintains that all sexual encounters were consensual, and did not testify during the trial. The retrial was initiated after Weinstein's initial conviction was overturned on appeal, and the split verdict reflects the complexity of the case and the jurors' differing perspectives on the accusations. The trial has been emotionally taxing for the accusers, with one stating that she hopes the verdict empowers others to speak out and seek justice. The jury continues to deliberate the remaining rape count. Optimism is tempered by the partial verdict and ongoing deliberations.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has ended its ban on funding nuclear power projects, marking a significant policy reversal. This decision could help poorer nations industrialize, reduce planet-warming emissions, and enhance U.S. competitiveness in the development of next-generation reactors. The move reflects a growing recognition of nuclear energy's potential to contribute to global energy needs while addressing climate change. By lifting the ban, the World Bank aims to support countries in their efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources and achieve sustainable development goals. This reversal could lead to increased investment in nuclear infrastructure in developing countries. The decision signals a shift towards embracing nuclear energy as a viable option for addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>The State Department is ordering the departure of all nonessential staff from its embassy in Baghdad due to increased security risks in the region. This decision is in line with President Trump's commitment to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad, as the department constantly assesses the appropriate personnel posture at all embassies. The embassy already has a limited number of nonessential employees, so the order is not expected to impact many individuals. The U.S. military will not be involved in transporting the nonessential personnel out of the country, but those plans could change if the situation on the ground calls for it. The order reflects heightened tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has expressed regret over some of his recent criticisms of President Trump, stating that they "went too far" following their public falling-out. This comes after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a public exchange of insults and accusations between the two. Vice President Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly urged Musk to repair his relationship with Trump. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Mr. Trump was "appreciative" of the public apology from Musk.

          <p>Small retailers who rely on imports from China are facing significant challenges due to ongoing trade tensions and tariffs.

          <p>The EPA is seeking to revoke a key rule that limits carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, arguing that the Biden-era rules were attempting to "suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment." The agency will also move to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, which restricts pollutants from coal and natural gas-fired power plants. Critics argue that the rollbacks could be dangerous and that the economic and health benefits of the previous rules outweigh the cost of compliance. Environmental groups say they are prepared to sue the EPA over the rollbacks. This decision reflects a shift in environmental policy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced that several convicted criminals who are in the United States illegally were arrested as part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Los Angeles. The ICE operations in Los Angeles triggered protests and riots, leading President Trump to deploy National Guard troops to protect the federal immigration officers. DHS highlighted nine arrests, all of whom the agency says are in the country illegally and have prior convictions. The Trump administration aims to increase ICE arrests to fulfill campaign promises of mass deportations. The ICE efforts have received scrutiny from Democrats, who say that Trump’s decision to deploy the guard and conduct ICE sweeps is instigating.</p>

The co-conspirators impersonated government officials and customer support services, tricking victims with fake threats. Song recruited people to create business entities and open bank accounts to transfer victim payments, taking a percentage of the payments before sending the money overseas.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the Trump administration is open to extending the 90-day tariff pause for top trading partners showing "good faith" in trade negotiations. Bessent stated the U.S. is working toward deals with its 18 "important trading partners". He suggested that for countries and trading blocs negotiating in good faith, the United States would "roll the date forward to continue good faith negotiations." This marks a shift from previous statements that required at least "terms of an agreement" before the pause expires. The U.S.-China deal was announced earlier on Wednesday, but the full details of the agreement were unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The draft trade agreement with China announced by Donald Trump would ease concerns from top US military suppliers about rare-earth metals and magnets, which are crucial for the production of various weapons. The deal would ensure that China will supply full magnets and any necessary rare earths up front. China had previously imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements during trade negotiations. Rare earths are crucial to the production of F-35 fighter jets, nuclear-powered submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and smart bombs. This agreement underscores the dependence of the US defense industry on Chinese rare earth metals.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump’s administration is discouraging governments around the world from attending a UN conference next week on a possible two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, according to a US cable seen by Reuters. The diplomatic demarche, sent on Tuesday, says countries that take “anti-Israel actions” following the conference will be viewed as acting in opposition to US foreign policy interests and could face diplomatic consequences from Washington. The demarche runs squarely against the diplomacy of two close allies, France and Saudi Arabia, who are co-hosting the gathering next week in New York that aims to lay out the parameters for a roadmap to a Palestinian state, while ensuring Israel’s security.</p>

When Miriam Haley heard the news last year that a New York court had thrown out a rape conviction against Harvey Weinstein, the man she helped put behind bars four years before, she was shocked. In 2020, Ms Haley told a Manhattan courtroom every detail of the time Weinstein sexually assaulted her in his New York apartment in 2006.

Combined with gold's soaring price, it is now second only to the U.S. dollar as their biggest reserve holding in value terms, the ECB said in its analysis Wednesday.
