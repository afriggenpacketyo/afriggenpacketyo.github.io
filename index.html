          <p>The U.S. government has officially taken a 10% non-voting equity stake in chipmaker Intel, as confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This strategic move, supported by President Trump, converts CHIPS Act funds into government ownership, signaling a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy to bolster domestic advanced chip production. Intel, currently challenged in the competitive AI chip market, is investing billions in new Ohio factories, although construction has seen delays. This unprecedented government intervention aims to secure the nation's technological independence in a critical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongly deported in March and later brought back to the U.S. on human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. He is now en route to Maryland to reunite with his family, under conditions set by a federal judge. This release follows a ruling blocking immigration authorities from detaining him further, despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's criticism and claims of his MS-13 gang affiliation, which his attorneys deny. His lawyers accuse federal prosecutors of "vindictive and selective prosecution" as his trial approaches in 2027.</p>

Transcripts released by the Justice Department reveal Maxwell claimed she never witnessed inappropriate behavior from figures like Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Despite her conviction for aiding Epstein, Maxwell maintained her innocence regarding the sexual exploitation of minors, asserting she only introduced Epstein to adult women and never recruited underage individuals.

The Hypernova glasses, expected to cost around $800, will feature a small digital display in the right lens for simple information and are developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The wristband, utilizing CTRL Labs technology, will enable control through hand gestures. While Meta aims to expand its wearables, it's setting low sales expectations due to the device's added components and weight, focusing on future full AR glasses.</p>

          <p>Transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche reveal her repeated praise for Donald Trump and assertions that she never observed him in any inappropriate settings. Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking, described Trump as "cordial and very kind." While detailing the social relationship between Trump and Epstein, she clarified she never saw them as "close friends" or Trump at Epstein's residence. The Justice Department granted Maxwell limited immunity for this testimony, which aimed to address concerns about Trump's past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>The summer of 2025 has been dubbed the "exhausting summer of nothing," characterized by a pervasive apathy despite numerous cultural trends. The absence of a clear "song of the summer" and the public's cynical engagement with phenomena like "Labubus" highlight a collective burnout. The article suggests that societal exhaustion, fueled by constant political culture wars and the difficulty of finding shared joy, has made it impossible to define a unifying summer theme. This reflects a broader trend where even popular trends are met with disdain, indicating a deeper cultural weariness.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate is set to vote on a controversial GOP redistricting bill that aims to create five new Republican-leaning congressional districts, following a weeks-long House standoff. This Republican-backed proposal, which passed the House along party lines, is expected to be approved by the Senate and signed by Governor Greg Abbott. Democrats have vowed to challenge the new map in court, arguing it undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power. The plan has sparked a nationwide fight over political boundaries, with California introducing a counter-redistricting plan to flip Republican seats.</p>
