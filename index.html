          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated that they denied access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who requested entry to the stadium's parking lots, while ICE denied ever being present. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) clarified that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles were briefly in the parking lot, unrelated to any enforcement activities, which BBC Verify confirmed some agents appeared to be wearing CBP badges. In response to recent immigration enforcement and protests in Los Angeles, the Dodgers announced a $1 million donation to support affected immigrant families, with player Kiké Hernández expressing solidarity with the community. Recent intensified ICE activity in Los Angeles is part of President Donald Trump's wider crackdown on immigration.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of endangering federal law enforcement by creating a sanctuary city environment. He claimed that their policies encouraged protesters to obstruct and endanger Border Patrol officials attempting to arrest violent criminals. Vance criticized Newsom's opposition to using the National Guard and Marines to quell anti-ICE riots, while highlighting a 9th Circuit Court ruling supporting the use of federal resources to secure the city. He stated that the President's administration will deploy federal law enforcement if cities fail to enforce laws and protect federal officers.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE custody in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, a decision criticized by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been detained since March. The Department of Homeland Security argued that an immigration judge had denied Khalil bond and ordered his removal, superseding the district judge's authority. Khalil's attorney asserted that he was being punished for speech protected by the First Amendment, and his bail conditions include surrendering his passport and restricting domestic travel.</p>

Despite a US District Judge ordering his release, the Trump administration is still attempting to deport Khalil based on allegations that he lied to obtain his green card. Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, celebrated his release, acknowledging the injustices brought upon their family by the Trump administration. The ruling permits Khalil limited travel within the US and the return of his green card, while his legal battle to remain in the US continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for maintaining steady interest rates and labeling him a "Total and Complete Moron." Trump has repeatedly urged Powell to lower interest rates more aggressively, though it remains unclear whether he has the legal authority to remove Powell before his term concludes in May 2026. Powell has stated he would not resign if asked by Trump, and the two met at the White House last month. Trump's criticism stems from the Fed's interest rate policies, which he believes are hindering economic growth, while the Fed remains cautious about causing inflation to spike.

Stylists emphasize that context is crucial, with shorts generally deemed too casual for client-facing roles in industries like law and finance. While some companies have no explicit dress codes, others advise monitoring colleagues' attire to avoid looking out of place. The type of shorts also matters, with tailored, formal shorts being more acceptable than beach, sports, cargo, or denim shorts, though some companies embrace more creative expressions of clothing.</p>

Multiple countries have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the US and Iran, but Trump has expressed frustration that Iran has shown no willingness to negotiate.

Yusuf, a multimillionaire businessman, brought a "Goldman Sachs-like mentality" to the role, which some found difficult to work with, especially volunteers and veterans of Eurosceptic politics. Prior to his role at Reform, Yusuf was the CEO of Velocity Black, where former employees reported similar issues, including controlling behavior and harsh dismissals.

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts received a one-game suspension from MLB following a benches-clearing incident during a game against the San Diego Padres. The altercation occurred after Dodgers relief pitcher Jack Little hit Fernando Tatis Jr. with a pitch, leading to a heated exchange between Roberts and Padres manager Mike Shildt. Shildt also received a one-game suspension, while Padres pitcher Robert Suarez was suspended three games for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani with a pitch. Bench coach Danny Lehmann will manage the Dodgers during Roberts' suspension.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering top national security officials who discussed military operations on Signal to notify the acting archivist of the United States of any messages at risk of deletion, but declined to order the recovery of past messages. American Oversight, a government watchdog, filed the lawsuit after a journalist was mistakenly added to a Signal chat where officials discussed a military attack against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The judge ruled that American Oversight failed to show that the recordkeeping programs of the agencies involved are "inadequate" or that the court can provide redress for already-deleted messages. The ruling comes amid concerns about potentially classified information being shared on the platform.</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy books have seen a surge in sales, pushing UK fiction revenue above £1 billion, with romantasy gaining a cult following on TikTok. Readers are drawn to the genre's guaranteed happy endings, focus on female pleasure, and exploration of tropes like "enemies to lovers." While attitudes toward romance are improving, some believe sexism still prevents the genre from being fully accepted in the mainstream. Romance readers are often voracious consumers, buying multiple editions of their favorite books and forming strong communities, challenging the perception that the genre is not serious business.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending by European allies, driven by pressure from President Donald Trump. Despite potential compromises and disagreements on trade and Russia, Secretary General Mark Rutte aims to present a united front and avoid conflict with the US. While some European nations are already boosting their defense spending, many may struggle to meet the new target of 3.5% of GDP, with creative accounting potentially obscuring the true extent of the increases. The summit's brevity and limited agenda are seen as efforts to manage divisions and cater to Trump's preferences.</p>
