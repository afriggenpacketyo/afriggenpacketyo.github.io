          <p>An international cybercrime group, Qilin, has claimed responsibility for a ransomware attack on the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, impacting its DocketMaster inmate management system. The hackers breached the system three weeks ago, obtaining contracts, inmate intake documents, and expense information, totaling 842 gigabytes. While no jail security operations were impacted, the outage has caused significant delays in inmate releases and court appearances, forcing the OPSO to implement manual workarounds. Authorities are refusing to pay the ransom, and the FBI has issued warnings about increasing malware attacks. This situation highlights the growing vulnerability of public institutions to cyber threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in August, matching July's figures, primarily driven by persistent increases in food costs, including cheese, fish, and vegetables. This data emerges as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets to discuss interest rates, with an announcement anticipated on Thursday. Despite inflation staying above the Bank's 2% target, the central bank is not expected to cut borrowing costs. This ongoing situation underscores the continued cost-of-living pressures facing consumers and the broader economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz asserted that hate speech is "absolutely" protected by the First Amendment, meaning individuals cannot be prosecuted for such expressions, even if deemed vile or offensive. His comments follow the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has ignited a national debate on the limits of free speech. Cruz advocates for alternative consequences, such as termination or expulsion, for those celebrating Kirk's murder, distinguishing his view from initial statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi. This article highlights the contentious legal and social interpretations surrounding hate speech.</p>

          <p>China's offshore yuan has strengthened past 7.1 per US dollar for the first time in nearly a year, reaching 7.0999, ahead of the US Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts this week. This marks a significant development in China's monetary policy, contributing to the yuan's gradual gain over the past month. Economists predict that the Fed's easing will likely further depreciate the US dollar, consequently leading to greater stability and strength for the yuan. This shift could have notable implications for global trade and financial markets.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the ice cream company, expressing deep disappointment over what he perceives as a loss of its social mission independence. In a public statement, Greenfield asserted that owner Unilever had initially promised to uphold the company's commitment to peace, justice, and human rights, but that this foundational independence is now "gone." Co-founder Ben Cohen echoed these sentiments, suggesting Greenfield's legacy should remain true to their core values, rather than being overshadowed by corporate control.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading Wednesday as investors awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely expected. Japan's Nikkei 225 was flat, while the Topix fell. Australian and South Korean indices retreated, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed, boosted by Baidu's surge after a bond offering and AI collaboration. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports plunged, highlighting its role as a bellwether for global demand. The overall market sentiment reflects caution ahead of the Fed's announcement.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a modest 0.1% year-on-year in August, a smaller decline than the 1.9% expected by economists, primarily due to a rebound in shipments to Asia. Despite this improvement, overall export growth remained negative for the fourth consecutive month. Exports to Western Europe also saw a sharp increase, partially offsetting a steeper fall in shipments to the US. This article notes that while the headline figures are better than anticipated, export volumes could still shrink in 2026 due to slower external demand.</p>

Secondly, the visit is seen as a crucial confidence boost for Britain's beleaguered government, which has faced recent political turmoil and accusations of harming business sentiment.

Ohtani later hit his 50th home run of the season, but the bullpen's struggles, a recurring issue, overshadowed his performance and led to another frustrating defeat.</p>

          <p>China's large reusable Tianlong-3 rocket has successfully passed a crucial "major exam," completing a 35-second burn with nine Tianhuo-12 engines that generated nearly 1,000 tonnes of thrust. Space Pioneer, the company behind the rocket, described this as the "most complex and challenging ground trial in rocket development." Having cleared this significant hurdle, the Tianlong-3 is now in its final sprint towards launch, with the company aiming for its maiden flight by the end of this year. They plan to quickly transition to routine commercial operations, targeting over 30 missions annually.</p>
