          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss a potential end to the war with Russia. The meeting was notably more cordial than their previous encounter, with Trump expressing optimism for a lasting peace and pledging "very good protection" for Ukraine, though specifics on security guarantees were not provided. Trump also backed away from a firm ceasefire demand, acknowledging strategic complexities, and indicated he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin following the talks to push for a trilateral summit.</p>

          <p>Reflecting the influence of internet culture on modern language, the Cambridge Dictionary has officially added several new words, including "skibidi," "delulu," "tradwife," and "broligarchy." These terms, largely popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha on social media platforms, have entered mainstream discourse, with "delulu" even being used by the Prime Minister of Australia. Lexicographers noted that they only add words that demonstrate staying power, highlighting how online trends are now rapidly shaping the evolution of the English language.</p>

The lawmakers, who fled the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps, declared their return a victory, stating they successfully raised national awareness and are now prepared to challenge the map in court. Governor Greg Abbott has called another special session where the redistricting plan is expected to be approved, setting the stage for a legal battle over gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey from a pre-med student obsessed with TV shows to an Emmy-nominated comedian. He discussed how pop culture served as a crash course in American life after his family moved from Quebec, and how his initial role as a writer at SNL provided a crucial understanding of the show's mechanics. Yang also shared personal anecdotes, including co-hosting the popular podcast "Las Culturistas" and hiding his sister's copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Washington for high-stakes talks with President Trump, Russia launched deadly drone strikes on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. The attacks killed at least seven people, including a toddler and a teenager, in what Ukrainian officials described as a deliberate message from Vladimir Putin that he has no intention of ending the war. The strikes targeted a residential building in the early morning, underscoring the brutal reality of the conflict even as diplomatic efforts for peace were underway.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds American Wages Continue to Lag Behind Inflation Four Years After Pandemic</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate indicates that American workers' wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past four years, with average earnings falling 1.2 percentage points behind the rise in the cost of living. This purchasing power decline helps explain persistent public dissatisfaction with the economy, as three-quarters of Americans feel their income is insufficient to cover higher prices. The report highlights that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind, while workers in high-demand sectors have seen wage growth outpace inflation.

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement follows a judge's ruling that Newsmax had indeed defamed the company, with the agreement being reached before a jury could determine malice or damages. This resolution comes after Fox News paid a much larger settlement in a similar case, highlighting the significant financial consequences for media outlets that propagated baseless election fraud conspiracies.</p>

          <p>An analysis of international support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion reveals the complexities of comparing U.S. and European contributions. According to the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has committed approximately $130.6 billion, making it the largest single donor, but the combined aid from European nations is higher at $165.7 billion. The article clarifies that aid from both sides has been a mix of grants and loans, challenging claims that only Europe's contributions are structured as repayable loans. This context is crucial as U.S. support for Ukraine remains a subject of political debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 58-year-old man in Frisco, Texas, is facing aggravated assault charges after he fired multiple shots at a car carrying three teenagers. The teens admitted they were participating in a "ding, dong, ditch" prank and had targeted the man's house. The homeowner, Damon Wolfe, initially called 911 claiming someone tried to kick in his door, but then went outside and shot at the teens' fleeing vehicle, striking it three times. Police officials warned both against the dangers of such pranks and the severe legal consequences for homeowners who respond with gunfire.</p>

A survey found that nearly a third of individuals using the OTC pill Opill had not been using any form of birth control beforehand. The study also showed that users of the prescription-free pill were more likely to be younger, uninsured, and live in rural areas, suggesting it is reducing significant barriers to access. The most common reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

The rate at which workers voluntarily quit has fallen to its lowest consistent level in over eight years, reflecting decreased confidence in the availability of new opportunities. This stagnation is linked to a cooling labor market, slower job growth, and higher interest rates, making both employers and employees more cautious about making changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advocate for using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple yet powerful strategy for long-term investors to harness the benefits of compound interest. Instead of receiving cash dividends, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures money is consistently put to work in an investment the owner already trusts. Over a decade, this strategy significantly boosted the total return of an S&P 500 ETF compared to just its price appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

The framework would reportedly involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages, while negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would continue. It remains uncertain how Israel will respond, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated he would only accept a deal that secures the release of all hostages at once.

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic envisions a specialized police unit in Washington, D.C., tasked with preventing "sandwich-based crimes." The piece humorously imagines the detectives' dismay after a 25-year streak without a sandwich-related incident is broken by a man throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent. Through the detectives' dialogue, the article playfully critiques heavy-handed policing tactics by contrasting them with the unit's supposed community-focused, non-carceral approach to de-escalating situations involving hoagies and paninis. The narrative serves as a commentary on law enforcement priorities and methods.</p>

Her comments have drawn sharp criticism from Jewish groups, who maintain that the IHRA definition is a crucial tool for identifying and combating antisemitism and was adopted to address the unlawful harassment experienced by Jews under Corbyn's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners aged 62 and older, a reverse mortgage can provide access to home equity in retirement, but experts advise that the best time to take one out depends on individual circumstances. Since the loan amount increases with age, waiting until one's 70s can yield more funds and is often better for those committed to aging in place. Homeowners should carefully consider their long-term financial needs, health, and other retirement income sources before tapping into their home equity, as the loan reduces the asset's value for heirs and must be repaid upon moving out.
