          <p>Shares of Kering, the French fashion house owning Gucci and Saint Laurent, jumped 9% following reports of Luca de Meo's potential appointment as CEO. De Meo, currently Renault's CEO, is credited with the carmaker's turnaround. Kering has struggled with its Gucci brand, leading to a search for new leadership to rejuvenate its brands and improve financial performance. Analysts believe de Meo's brand management and marketing skills could benefit Kering, though challenges remain in the luxury sector, including consumer preference for top brands and the need for significant investment.

          <p>The documentary "Sabbath Queen" follows Amichai Lau-Lavie, an openly queer rabbi from a long Orthodox lineage, exploring his identity and calls for peace. Lau-Lavie, a social activist and community leader, uses his experiences to challenge homophobia, racism, and misogyny within Judaism. The film highlights his journey from a drag queen persona, Rebbetzin Hadassah Gross, to becoming a Conservative rabbi, pushing boundaries with interfaith weddings and queer interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. Despite facing criticism, Lau-Lavie advocates for compassion towards all, emphasizing the need for morality and love in Jewish tradition, especially amidst increasing polarization.</p>

          <p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has drastically reduced its aid plans due to significant funding cuts. OCHA is now seeking $29 billion, a decrease from the $44 billion requested in December, to assist 114 million people facing life-threatening needs across the world. With only 13% of the required funding received, the agency is prioritizing aid to the most urgent cases. The cuts are attributed to reduced contributions from major donors, including the United States, amid global economic uncertainty, forcing the UN to make difficult choices in allocating resources.</p>

Modi's visit also carries significance in India, as it is interpreted as a message to Turkey, given its support for Pakistan in recent hostilities with India.

          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a lack of sufficient incinerator capacity to handle the additional waste, leading to the temporary export solution. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfill, the short-term impact will be increased emissions from transporting waste to England. Despite efforts to increase recycling rates, domestic recycling rates in Scotland have seen minimal improvement over the past decade.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Canada for the G7 summit, with a key focus on a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding tariffs. The summit addresses challenges ranging from Trump's tariff policy to tensions following Israel's attack on Iran. Ishiba aims to advocate for unity within the G7 to tackle various global issues, including the situation in the Indo-Pacific region. Japan seeks to address higher U.S. tariffs on cars, auto parts, steel, and aluminum, which threaten its export-driven economy ahead of crucial elections.</p>

          <p>Immigration raids continued in Southern California, sparking anxiety and anger, even as President Trump appeared to soften his stance on some workplace raids. ICE agents conducted a raid at a Santa Fe Springs swap meet, leading to the postponement of a concert. Trump recently acknowledged that some undocumented immigrants perform essential services, potentially signaling a shift in policy. However, union leaders remain skeptical about leniency towards rural workers, and tensions remain high, with protests occurring during a soccer match at SoFi Stadium. Community organizations are providing support to street vendors affected by the raids.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary will become more frequent by the end of this century due to global warming. Warmer temperatures will cause upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, refreezing and accumulating in colder areas. This localized hazard can lead to destructive flooding and damage to downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood dynamics to reach their conclusions, highlighting the impact of climate change on this critical river.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Israel's response to the October 7, 2023, attack and subsequent actions in Gaza and attacks against Iran have damaged its reputation. The piece suggests that the ongoing conflict is a result of a broken status quo where the rights of Palestinians are suppressed and the justification for Israel's actions have been stretched beyond plausibility. The author contends that Prime Minister Netanyahu is using the war to bolster his political career and that Israel's actions have made it less safe and further destabilized the region. By engaging another enemy, the Israeli government has a chance at both restoring the terms of its pact with its sponsors, and the historical narrative that it is the victim, acting in irreproachable good faith.</p>

          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump’s proposed “revenge tax” could deter foreign investment into the United States. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a provision allowing the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions with "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. individuals and companies. This measure, known as Section 899, classifies digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes as unfair. Critics fear this could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe haven status, potentially impacting UK and French companies.</p>

          <p>Leaders of major economic powers have gathered in Canada for a G7 summit overshadowed by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and unresolved trade issues. The recent strikes between Israel and Iran have heightened global instability, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer noting discussions on de-escalation efforts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to forgo a joint statement, and the summit is expected to involve bilateral conversations focused on trade and the Israel-Iran crisis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to attend and meet with President Trump.</p>

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, designed as a stepping stone to homeownership, face growing discontent due to complaints about repairs, costs, and selling difficulties. Complaints to the housing watchdog have surged, with shared owners citing a lack of homeowner rights and the obligations of renters. Some shared owners struggle to sell, losing money due to re-evaluations, leading to frustration and a return to private renting. The Housing Ombudsman highlights inherent complexities and a mismatch between shared owners' expectations and landlords' responsibilities, advocating for government action to address fundamental inequities.</p>
