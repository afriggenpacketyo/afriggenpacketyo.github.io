          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is projected to strengthen into a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Currently east of the northern Leeward Islands, Jerry has maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and is moving northwest. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for several islands, with forecasters anticipating 2-4 inches of rain and a risk of flash flooding. Swells generated by Jerry are also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions across the region.</p>

          <p>Rutgers University professor Mark Bray, known for his work on anti-fascism, initially faced an unexplained cancellation of his flight to Spain, where he plans to relocate due to death threats. Bray, who has taught courses on anti-fascism and published a book on the topic, stated his family's reservation 'disappeared' at the gate. This incident occurred hours after a White House roundtable on antifa, a group Bray has researched but not joined. Despite the initial setback, Bray and his family were rebooked and successfully departed for Europe.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Prosecutors allege James misrepresented the use of a Norfolk, Virginia home, securing a mortgage for a secondary residence while using it as a rental investment property. James vehemently denies the charges, calling them "baseless" and accusing President Trump of weaponizing the justice system for political retribution. If convicted, James could face substantial prison time and fines.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. U.S. District Judge April Perry cited the Department of Homeland Security's "unreliable" assessment of events in the Chicago area, stating there was no credible evidence of an organized rebellion. State and local leaders, including Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, had objected to the deployment, calling it illegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous. The ruling emphasizes the court's role in scrutinizing federal military intervention on civilian streets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a thrilling 2-1 walk-off victory in 11 innings against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, clinching the series three games to one. The decisive run came in the bottom of the 11th when Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering mishandled a grounder and made an errant throw home, allowing pinch-runner Hyeseong Kim to score. The game, initially a pitchers' duel, evolved into a bullpen battle, culminating in a dramatic error that sent the Dodgers to the National League Championship Series.</p>

The rally is partly attributed to an OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) deal, which could involve OpenAI acquiring a 10% stake in AMD. Nvidia also experienced a rise, with CEO Jensen Huang confirming increased demand and the company's investment in Elon Musk's xAI startup. (not investment advice)</p>

Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva cited the 8-acre size of the initial Lachman fire and the limited depth of their cameras as reasons for not deploying the technology. However, former arson investigators and fire experts argue that thermal imaging is standard protocol for preventing rekindled fires. The Palisades fire killed 12 people, charred 23,400 acres, and destroyed over 6,800 structures after an ember, buried deep within vegetation, was fanned by hurricane-force winds days later.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a controversial financial rescue plan for Argentina, purchasing Argentine pesos and finalizing terms for a $20 billion currency swap line. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the move, emphasizing the "systemic importance" of Argentina's reform agenda for Western Hemisphere stability. The plan aims to calm a currency crisis ahead of Argentina's midterm elections, where President Javier Milei's austerity measures face growing backlash despite curbing inflation. Critics in the US, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, question the support given domestic spending cuts and concerns from American farmers over trade shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill into law making it illegal to declaw cats, a practice deemed inhumane and outdated by lawmakers and animal advocates. Assembly Bill 867 prohibits veterinarians from performing the procedure, which involves amputating the first bone in each toe, unless medically necessary. The new law aligns California with New York and numerous other countries that have banned elective declawing, reflecting a growing consensus among veterinarians and pet owners against the practice. Animal welfare groups championed the bill, advocating for alternatives like nail trimming and emphasizing the long-term pain and behavioral issues associated with declawing.</p>

U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that Lamar's criticisms of Drake in the song did not constitute defamation because a "reasonable listener could not have concluded that 'Not Like Us' was conveying objective facts." Drake had alleged UMG endangered his life and devalued his music by promoting a song that depicted him as a pedophile.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a series of animal welfare bills into law, tightening regulations on puppy sales and enhancing buyer protections. These laws, prompted by a Times investigation into deceptive breeding practices, ban online marketplaces for dog brokers, void pet purchase contracts with nonrefundable deposits, and mandate public access to health certificates. The legislation aims to close loopholes that emerged after California banned pet store sales of commercially bred animals, which led to a surge in unregulated online sales. While animal welfare groups support the measures, concerns remain about enforcement, particularly for out-of-state sellers.</p>

This figure, an upward revision from earlier estimates, still represents a slight decrease from 2024's 4.3%. Despite the positive performance, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) cautions against complacency, highlighting the continued high risks associated with unpredictable trade policy shifts in the United States.

A federal judge in Illinois has already partially blocked the deployment, questioning the administration's assessment of the situation. Critics, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, view these deployments as federal overreach and an attempt to manufacture civil unrest, raising constitutional concerns about executive power.</p>

          <p>Scientific research increasingly highlights the significant health benefits of spending time in nature, demonstrating measurable physiological and psychological changes. Just 20 minutes outdoors can lower stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, reduce blood pressure, and improve heart rate variability. The sensory experience of nature, including the smell of trees and soil, introduces beneficial organic compounds and good bacteria into the body, positively impacting gut health and boosting the immune system. Studies show that even short periods in natural environments can strengthen the body's virus-fighting cells and enhance overall well-being, suggesting nature acts as a vital calming and strengthening force.</p>
