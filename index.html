          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, received a liver transplant thanks to a Facebook plea that reconnected him with Kristin Johnston, a high school classmate he hadn't seen in 20 years. Doctors initially gave Register a year to a year-and-a-half to live, prompting his wife to create a Facebook group to find a living liver donor. Johnston, a preschool teacher, saw the post, realized she was a blood type match, and volunteered to donate part of her liver. The surgery, involving the transplant of 70% of Johnston’s liver, is expected to give Register a fresh start and both a second chance at health, while the Register family launched a fundraiser to help with expenses.</p>

The details were reportedly shared in two chat groups, including one with Vice President JD Vance and another with Hegseth's wife, who is not a government employee.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached a deal with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police hiring that was cut in the recent budget. The agreement ensures that the council will identify funds for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days, reversing a previous decision to reduce the number of new officers. Restoring the police recruits will require an additional $13.3 million for the coming year, and about $60 million in 2026-27, while Bass thanked the council for coming together on the deal to make Los Angeles safer. The budget also invests in emergency response, homeless services, street repairs, and other essential programs.</p>

The dogs were discovered living amidst their own waste, packed into cages, or roaming in cramped, filthy quarters, while many were mother dogs with nursing puppies. The SPCA, in collaboration with Raleigh animal control, is providing medical care to the dogs, many of whom suffer from skin and dental issues, and will eventually place them up for adoption. The homeowner surrendered 21 chickens in addition to the dogs, and it remains unclear whether they will face charges.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians are turning to remembrance politics, with initiatives addressing historical injustices. Parliament voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing the wrongful accusation of treason he faced in the 19th century, while a law was passed to compensate returnees from French Indochina who suffered in temporary camps after colonial rule ended. Additionally, the Assembly adopted a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt" from 1825, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations, with these initiatives reflecting a tradition of remembrance politics in France, though some view them as easier to pass than structural reforms.</p>

The UN aims to get the High Seas Treaty, designed to protect 30% of the ocean, ratified by 60 countries, while scientists and NGOs express concern about the effectiveness of MPAs if practices like bottom trawling are still allowed.

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced that the German government would seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the legality of migrant turnbacks at the border. The decision follows a Berlin court ruling that deemed the refusal to allow three Somali nationals to enter Germany unlawful, as border guards failed to initiate proper asylum procedures. Dobrindt emphasized the need to crack down on illegal migration to prevent the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from gaining further traction, while Germany introduced tougher border checks in May, leading to the denial of entry for asylum seekers and other migrants.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey's research indicates that a significant portion of Americans are not adequately saving for retirement, leading to a reliance on Social Security benefits that may not provide sufficient income. Ramsey's 2023 "Today's Retirement Crisis" study, based on a 2016 survey, reveals that 42% of Americans are not currently saving for the future. He advises individuals to create a savings benchmark, aiming to save at least 15% of their gross income, and emphasizes the importance of having an emergency fund and being debt-free. Ramsey stresses the need for individuals to proactively build a safety net to protect their financial future in retirement (not investment advice).</p>
