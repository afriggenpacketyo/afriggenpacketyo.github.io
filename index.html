          <p>According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, at least 21 people were killed and 179 injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid distribution site west of Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces stated that there were "no known casualties from IDF gunfire" within the site and that the matter is under investigation. Local witnesses reported the shooting occurred approximately 1,000 yards from the aid site, which is managed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, though the GHF reported earlier that aid distribution occurred without incident.

          <p>A Republican-led budget bill in Congress proposes limiting federal student loans for professional programs like medical school to $150,000, potentially worsening the national doctor shortage. Medical students rely heavily on federal loans to finance their education, and the proposed changes could deter low-income students from pursuing medicine. Experts warn that these limits could also drive doctors away from lower-paid specialties such as family medicine and primary care. The article explores the potential consequences of the bill, including reduced access to medical care and increased reliance on private lenders. (not investment advice)</p>
