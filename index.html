          <p>Horror icon Cassandra Peterson, known as Elvira, has reiterated her disappointment with Ariana Grande's alleged "diva" behavior during a past encounter, nearly a year after first publicizing the incident. Peterson recounted Grande bringing 20 guests to her show, for whom Elvira posed for pictures and signed autographs, only for Grande to refuse a photo with Peterson before leaving. Grande later apologized, citing an anxiety attack and not recalling the interaction, but Peterson found the apology unimpressive and somewhat backhanded. Peterson hopes that Grande, still young in her career, will eventually learn humility and graciousness from her experiences in show business.</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport in Lithuania enacted a temporary closure of its airspace early Sunday morning, with local media reporting the disruption was caused by the possible presence of hot air balloons. The airport confirmed the closure and advised passengers to seek updates, noting that several flights had to be rerouted to alternative airports such as Riga and Kaunas. This event is part of a recent trend of European airport closures, some previously triggered by drone sightings, highlighting ongoing airspace management challenges. Authorities were investigating the nature and trajectory of the balloons, causing significant but temporary travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins, previously winless, achieved a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, marking a significant turnaround for the team. Under the guidance of tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel, who was elevated to playcaller just four days before the game, the offense scored on its initial five drives. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a standout performance, contributing three rushing touchdowns and two passing touchdowns, totaling 128 rushing yards and 166 passing yards. Despite a late surge from Penn State, UCLA's defense made a critical stop, securing a win that brought immense relief and excitement to the team and its fans, who chanted Neuheisel's name throughout the game.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," a prevalent ailment among new university students, is identified by experts as a collection of common cold viruses, not actual influenza. Its rapid transmission is attributed to the convergence of thousands of students from diverse regions into close living and learning environments, exposing them to numerous novel respiratory pathogens. Contributing significantly to this phenomenon are the lifestyle factors common during freshers' week, including sleep deprivation from late-night socializing, compromised diets, heightened stress, and increased alcohol intake. These elements collectively weaken the immune system, creating an optimal breeding ground for infections and making the illness difficult for students to evade.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a televised statement, asserted that Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement" regarding the Gaza conflict. He expressed optimism about announcing the return of all Israeli hostages, both alive and deceased, "in the coming days," contingent on Hamas's release in the first phase. Netanyahu clarified that while IDF forces would redeploy, they would retain control of territories deep within Gaza. Concurrently, President Donald Trump issued a warning to Hamas, emphasizing the need for quick action on the peace deal, stating that "all bets will be off" if delays occur. Indirect negotiations between Israeli and Hamas representatives are anticipated to begin in Egypt to finalize the intricate details of the proposed agreement.</p>

          <p>In Tbilisi, Georgia, police used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace. This incident occurred amidst a prolonged political crisis, following last year's parliamentary election which the pro-European Union opposition claims was stolen by the ruling Georgian Dream party. Protesters, many of whom believe the government is aligning with Russia's interests and has stalled EU membership talks, marched on the day of local elections largely boycotted by the opposition. The demonstration highlights deep public discontent and a government crackdown that has seen many opposition leaders imprisoned and activists penalized with substantial fines for participating in protests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, effectively blocking a Trump administration policy that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention facilities upon reaching their 18th birthday. US District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that this practice contravenes a 2021 court order requiring minors to be released to the "least restrictive setting available" unless deemed a danger or flight risk. This legal intervention comes amid broader criticisms of the Trump administration's immigration approach, which has faced accusations of attempting to coerce self-deportation with financial incentives and reviving family separation tactics. The ruling ensures that these young individuals will not be automatically moved to adult detention centers.</p>

Pritzker countered that state, county, and local law enforcement were already effectively managing public safety and protecting constitutional rights, asserting that President Trump's motivation was political control rather than genuine safety.

A key factor is the increasing disengagement of the United States, historically the UN's principal architect, largest financial contributor, and host nation, from the multilateral framework it helped create. This US retreat, as highlighted in the article, is seen as potentially creating a "tremendous opportunity" for other nations, notably China, to assert greater influence and leadership within the global body.

The proposed 20-point plan includes the release of 48 hostages, a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern the strip.

          <p>A recent explosion and hours-long fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery deeply unsettled South Bay communities, causing injuries and casting an orange glow with towering smoke. This incident has brought to light the refinery's extensive history of safety and environmental violations, including 13 notices of violation in the last year alone. A significant concern is that federal investigations into the fire's root cause may be severely hampered by the ongoing government shutdown, which has furloughed most staff at key agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board. Environmental advocates argue that the defunding of these federal bodies undermines crucial accountability mechanisms, raising serious concerns for worker safety and the prevention of future hazardous chemical releases in the absence of comprehensive oversight.</p>

While ANO shares common ground with the Motorists on issues like opposing EU emissions targets, potential coalition talks with the SPD face challenges due to Babis's firm stance against referendums on EU or NATO membership and the SPD's more extreme proposals regarding Ukrainian refugees.</p>

          <p>The annual Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach continued as scheduled, but notably without the participation of the U.S. military, a significant attraction, due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. Attendees, including veterans, expressed considerable disappointment over the absence of American fighter jets and military displays, which typically showcase advanced aeronautical might. Despite this setback, the event featured performances by the British Royal Air Force, Canadian Armed Forces, and other aerobatic teams, maintaining a vibrant, patriotic atmosphere on the ground. The situation underscored the tangible consequences of the congressional budget deadlock, demonstrating how political impasses directly affect public events and the display of national capabilities, much to the frustration of many attendees.</p>

          <p>Liverpool, under new manager Arne Slot, has experienced a dramatic downturn in form, suffering consecutive Premier League defeats due to late goals and dropping from the top of the table. Chelsea secured a 2-1 win with a 95th-minute strike, just days after Crystal Palace inflicted a 97th-minute loss. These results, coupled with a Champions League defeat, mark Slot's first three-game losing streak in his coaching career. Pundits suggest Liverpool's earlier reliance on dramatic late winners disguised underlying performance issues, which are now being exposed by a perceived lack of balance from recent expensive signings and increased defensive vulnerabilities. The upcoming international break is seen as a crucial opportunity for the team to regroup and address their alarming slump in form.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has announced an ambitious plan to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the country within five years if they win the upcoming general election. Unveiled at their annual conference, the proposals include banning asylum claims from individuals entering the UK without permission and transferring the appeals process from the Immigration Tribunal to Home Office officials. The party intends to rebrand its immigration enforcement unit as a "Removals Force," doubling its annual funding to £1.6 billion with a mandate to deport 150,000 people annually. Additionally, the Conservatives have pledged to end the UK's 75-year membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to facilitate these removals, marking a significant policy shift.</p>

          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates, claiming they conducted attacks in the oil-rich Khuzestan province on behalf of Israel, targeting police, security forces, and orchestrating bombings. Human rights organizations, including Hengaw, identified the men as "Arab political prisoners" arrested during 2019 protests, asserting they were subjected to severe torture and forced into televised confessions. These executions contribute to a significant increase in the use of the death penalty in Iran, reaching levels unseen in decades, particularly following the Iran-Israel war in June and recent nationwide protests. International human rights experts at the United Nations have consistently criticized Iran's execution practices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared in an interview that a Gaza peace deal is "very close," even as Israel reportedly continued its airstrikes on the territory. Trump emphasized his commitment to finalizing the 20-point plan with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, asserting Netanyahu's acceptance was assured. This statement followed Trump's earlier directive for Israel to "immediately" cease bombing Gaza after Hamas accepted certain elements of the proposed deal. However, reports from Gaza's civil defense agency indicated that dozens of airstrikes and artillery shelling persisted, highlighting a significant discrepancy between diplomatic claims and the situation on the ground. Trump also credited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for his instrumental role in pressing Hamas towards an agreement.</p>

Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his hope for the return of all remaining hostages by the conclusion of the upcoming Jewish Sukkot holiday. US envoys, including Jared Kushner, are heading to Egypt for negotiations focusing on hostage release, Israeli troop withdrawal, humanitarian aid, and prisoner exchanges. While Hamas has partially accepted the plan, it requires endorsement from other Palestinian factions for full implementation.</p>

Jones issued a "deepest apology" to Gilbert and his family, taking full responsibility for his "embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry" words. Both Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep.

Despite one risky dash from his goal, Lammens' composure stood out. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the need for Lammens to adapt to a new country and the intense pressure of the position. Former Everton midfielder Leon Osman commended Amorim's cautious approach in integrating Lammens, allowing him to acclimate to the team dynamics and the demanding Premier League environment before his first start.</p>

          <p>Turkey is navigating a delicate energy balancing act, grappling with significant dependence on Russian oil and gas while facing increasing pressure from the US and G7 nations to curtail these imports. Last year, Russia accounted for 66% of Turkey's oil and 41% of its natural gas imports, with Turkey benefiting from discounted prices due to EU sanctions. Despite this economic advantage, Turkey is proactively pursuing a diversification strategy, evidenced by recent long-term LNG contracts with companies from the US, Australia, Egypt, Algeria, Qatar, and Nigeria. This multi-pronged approach aims to bolster energy security and foster improved relations with the US, alongside promoting domestic and renewable energy sources, even as fossil fuels continue to dominate its energy market.</p>

Jack Daniel's, owned by Brown-Forman, states the change is necessary to meet global environmental goals and ensure international sales, with a new anaerobic digester facility now converting waste into renewable energy.

          <p>Pharmacy chain Rite Aid has officially announced the closure of all its remaining locations, bringing an end to its decades of business operations.

Since that time, over 520 Rite Aid pharmacies, representing approximately a quarter of its total stores, have already ceased operations. The company's financial woes were exacerbated by a Justice Department complaint in March 2023, which accused Rite Aid of violating federal acts by dispensing unlawful prescriptions and disregarding internal warnings.</p>
