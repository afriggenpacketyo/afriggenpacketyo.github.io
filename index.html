          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 3% to an all-time high, primarily fueled by significant gains in Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix shares. This rise followed the announcement of a memory chip partnership between the two tech giants and OpenAI. Other Asian markets, including Japan and Hong Kong, also saw advances, while U.S. equity futures remained stable amid expectations of a short government shutdown. The positive market performance reflects investor optimism in the technology sector and broader economic trends.</p>

While graphic depictions are blocked, other investigation records, including videos of distraught friends, will be made public, balancing privacy with public interest in the case.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration froze approximately $26 billion in funds designated for projects in Democratic-leaning states. This includes $18 billion for transit projects in New York and nearly $8 billion for green energy initiatives across 16 states. Democratic leaders, like Senator Chuck Schumer, criticized the move as partisan, accusing the administration of using Americans as "pawns." Vice President JD Vance warned that layoffs of federal workers could follow if the shutdown persists.</p>

          <p>Amidst the ongoing government shutdown, a key point of contention is the debate over healthcare for immigrants.

          <p>Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge debunks common myths about cooking oils, emphasizing that no single oil is a magic key to health. She recommends rapeseed and sunflower oils for cooking due to their low saturated fat content and high levels of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, which are beneficial for heart and brain health. Forouhi also clarifies that while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil is ideal for deep frying due due to higher smoke points.</p>
