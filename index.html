          <p>Coventry City Football Club has finalized the purchase of the Coventry Building Society Arena, a move the club's owner described as a "pivotal moment" ensuring its long-term stability. The acquisition from Frasers Group ends years of uncertainty for the club and its supporters, who have experienced multiple stadium owners and home grounds since leaving Highfield Road in 2005. This ownership allows the club to invest directly in facilities and fan experience, fostering ambition for a return to the Premier League.</p>

          <p>A Florida judge has denied bond for Rajinder Singh, a truck driver from India accused of causing a fatal crash on the Florida Turnpike that resulted in three deaths. The judge ruled that Singh, who is in the country without authorization, poses a substantial flight risk and found probable cause for the six charges against him, including vehicular homicide and manslaughter. The incident occurred when Singh allegedly attempted an illegal U-turn, causing his semi-truck to block traffic and leading to a collision with a minivan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), stating it believes the program is unconstitutional. This decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, which argues the program's eligibility threshold of 25% Hispanic undergraduate enrollment is discriminatory. Citing the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against affirmative action, the department's move shifts the legal defense to a national association of HSI universities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's attempt to withhold federal grant funding from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The ruling blocks the administration from stripping Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants from these jurisdictions over their limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's escalating efforts to compel local and state governments to assist in federal immigration actions.</p>

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex-trafficking, also stated she does not believe Epstein died by suicide.</p>

          <p>Decades after their introduction, China's DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remain a crucial component of the country's nuclear deterrent strategy. Although not the newest in the PLA Rocket Force's arsenal, these mobile-launched missiles provide a credible second-strike capability, able to reach the mainland United States. A recent full-range test in 2024 underscored their reliability and strategic importance, sending a clear geopolitical signal about China's capacity for nuclear counterstrikes.</p>

          <p>Some businesses in the U.S. are reintroducing "recession specials," a marketing tactic from the Great Recession, in response to growing economic anxiety. Establishments from New York to San Francisco are offering discounted meals and events with names that explicitly reference a potential downturn. This trend reflects a broader decline in consumer sentiment, as indicated by recent university surveys, with consumers bracing for a slowdown and pulling back on spending amid concerns over trade policy and inflation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, arguing they reflect a century-old "Lost Cause" narrative that seeks to minimize the horrors of slavery. The author compares the administration's rhetoric to the historical revisionism promoted by groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which aimed to rebrand the Confederacy and downplay slavery's brutality. The piece frames the attacks as a politically motivated effort to control the national narrative by undermining educational and cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of Congress and legal advocates are calling for the immediate closure of a new, large-scale immigration detention facility at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas. Following a tour, lawmakers described the tent facility, which is set to expand to 5,000 beds, as a "dangerous misuse of military land" and raised concerns about a lack of oversight and access to legal services for detainees. Critics argue the camp represents a costly and inhumane escalation of the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.</p>

          <p>While standard sunscreen protects against UV radiation, dermatologists are increasingly highlighting the benefits of tinted sunscreens for blocking visible light. Research shows that visible light can contribute to skin conditions like hyperpigmentation and melasma, which are more common in people with darker skin. Tinted sunscreens, which contain iron oxides, offer protection from this part of the light spectrum that most non-tinted products do not, making them a more effective option for managing these specific skin concerns.</p>
