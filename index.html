          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, while campaigning for New Jersey governor, suggested the possibility of a third impeachment of Donald Trump to prevent Republicans from gaining power after the 2026 midterms. Sherrill, who voted for both of Trump's previous impeachments, emphasized the importance of challenging oneself and mobilizing against Trump's divisive tactics. She highlighted the role of states in challenging the Trump agenda, particularly concerning election systems, and underscored the significance of federalism in resisting federal overreach. Her comments came amidst a crowded Democratic primary field for the New Jersey governorship, following current Governor Phil Murphy's term limit. </p>

Romero capitalized on Garc√≠a's cautious approach, securing the WBA welterweight title. Garc√≠a acknowledged the impact of his inactivity and mental struggles, while Romero expressed his ambition to face any opponent at 147 pounds, emphasizing his pursuit of championships over monetary gains. </p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic pressures and a complex geopolitical landscape. Voters are concerned about the rising cost of living and housing affordability, despite Australia's reputation as a stable, prosperous nation. The election pits Prime Minister Anthony Albanese against opposition leader Peter Dutton, with both offering measures to address economic concerns. The election also reflects a shift away from major parties, with voters increasingly turning to independent candidates, and the failure of a referendum to enshrine Indigenous rights in Parliament, and the association of one of the candidates with President Trump's policies, impacting voter sentiment.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar, driven by increased demand related to equity investments.

This action comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further increase capital inflow into Hong Kong.

          <p>Saturday's British newspapers are dominated by two main stories: Reform UK's impact on local elections and Prince Harry's BBC interview. Reform UK's gains have sent shockwaves through the political establishment, while Prince Harry discusses his strained relationship with the royal family and concerns about his father's health. The Prime Minister acknowledged voters weren't feeling the benefits of his policies, while other papers highlighted Reform UK's pledges to cut local authority spending and stop council employees from working from home. The interview with Prince Harry included his reflections on losing an appeal over his security in the UK.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is suing the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies, claiming they hinder federal immigration enforcement efforts. The lawsuit argues that Colorado's laws, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities, violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The suit specifically mentions an apartment complex in Aurora which President Trump claimed last year had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang. Local officials deny the claims, but the Justice Department argues that Colorado's policies allowed the gang to seize control of the building.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. While President Trump eased the measure in response to business concerns, the tariff aims to encourage carmakers to increase manufacturing in the US. However, analysts predict that any immediate expansions in the US will likely come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Some car companies have already warned of increased costs due to the tariffs, while others have withdrawn financial guidance for the year ahead, citing the uncertainty of the situation.</p>

The expansion of tariff-free shipments had enabled the rise of low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein, which heavily invested in digital advertising. President Trump's decision to eliminate the exemption for goods valued at less than $800 has led to reduced advertising spending by these companies. Temu has already stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, and Shein has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions and at other intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA). The cuts will be implemented over several years, primarily through reduced hiring, and include employees who have already opted for early retirement. The CIA stated that the changes are part of a strategy to align the agency with President Trump‚Äôs national security priorities and infuse it with renewed energy. The Trump administration has also eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies.</p>
