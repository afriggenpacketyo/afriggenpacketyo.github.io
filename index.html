          <p>Japan and the Philippines have agreed to initiate discussions towards establishing security pacts, signaling a move to strengthen their defense cooperation amidst concerns over China's increasing influence in the region. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines confirmed their commitment to commence talks on an intelligence-sharing deal, recognizing the urgency of its conclusion, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This agreement underscores the growing strategic alignment between Japan and the Philippines in response to regional security challenges. Separately, a cross-party group of Japanese lawmakers has urged China to lift its ban on Japanese seafood imports, reflecting ongoing diplomatic efforts to resolve trade disputes. The lawmakers met with China's top legislator Zhao Leji, who indicated that Chinese government entities are proactively considering lifting the ban.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to disburse $12 million in congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. Judge Royce C. Lamberth emphasized that Congress had specifically allocated the funds to RFE/RL, and President Trump himself signed the legislation. The ruling follows previous attempts by the Trump administration to terminate RFE/RL's grant and exert control over its programming, which the judge deemed unlawful. The news organization, which reports in nearly 30 languages and reaches 47 million people weekly, was on the brink of collapse due to the funding delays.</p>

Capital investments in Canada have stalled due to trade war anxieties, and businesses are looking to Carney to restore order in commerce with the United States. As the first major leader elected on an anti-Trump platform, Carney's approach to managing relations with the U.S. will be closely watched.</p>

          <p>A California judge has ruled that Border Patrol agents in the Eastern District of California cannot detain individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that they may flee. The ruling follows arrests made during "Operation Return to Sender" and a lawsuit filed by the ACLU alleging unconstitutional detentions. The judge's order mandates that CBP agents explain individuals' rights before deporting them via "voluntary departure."

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that eased some tariffs for carmakers, addressing concerns that tariffs would backfire on U.S. manufacturing by raising production costs. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies. Carmakers can also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over two years. While automakers welcomed any relaxation of tariffs, analysts noted that administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers.</p>

Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

          <p>Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz has stated that an abandoned ranch in western Mexico, previously believed to be an "extermination camp," was a training hub for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Gertz said there is no evidence of human cremations at the ranch, despite claims from groups searching for missing relatives. He noted that a container of very small bone fragments was found, but studies did not find heat levels over 200 degrees Celsius, which is required for cremations. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are looking into other possible "narco-ranches" in the area.</p>

Turkey has built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq since 2018, effectively controlling over 2,000 sq km of Iraqi land. The expansion has led to deforestation and displacement of local communities, with residents fearing Turkey's long-term intentions for the territory.

          <p>A study comparing healing rates of humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice found that human wounds took more than twice as long to heal as wounds of any of the other mammals. The slow healing may be a result of an evolutionary trade-off humans made long ago, when they shed fur in favor of naked, sweaty skin that keeps them cool. Furry animals are covered in follicles, which help quickly close up wounds in mice or monkeys, while human skin has very puny hair follicles. Researchers speculate that social support among prehistoric humans might have helped wounded people stay alive, despite slower healing.</p>
