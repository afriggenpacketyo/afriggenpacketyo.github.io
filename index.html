          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case stemming from a 2017 FBI raid on the wrong house in Atlanta, during which agents used a battering ram and a flash-bang grenade. The couple inside, Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin, were handcuffed and questioned before agents realized their mistake, prompted by a GPS error. Justices expressed incredulity at the government's defense of the operation, with some questioning the lack of policies to prevent such errors. The court seemed inclined to send the case back to lower courts for further review, highlighting the importance of basic due diligence by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A Russian military court sentenced Yegor Semenov to 27 years in prison for attempting to kill army pilots with poisoned alcohol and cakes, allegedly on orders from Ukrainian intelligence. Semenov, a dual national, was reportedly promised $5,000 for the act, which targeted a pilots' graduation party in Armavir. The plot failed when the pilots grew suspicious and tests revealed a lethal dose of a medical drug in the items. Semenov was charged with state treason and terrorism, and prosecutors plan to appeal the verdict, seeking a life sentence.</p>

          <p>California, along with several other states, is suing the Trump administration over substantial cuts to AmeriCorps, arguing that the administration is unlawfully dismantling a program vital for disaster relief and community support. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Government Efficiency is acting without regard for the thousands of volunteers or the communities that benefit from AmeriCorps' services. The cuts have led to widespread harm in California, where the program invested over $133 million last year and deployed thousands of volunteers to various locations.</p>

          <p>In this 'Dear James' column, a reader asks why they always feel the urge to finish a book, even when thoroughly enjoying it. James Parker responds by exploring the human tendency to constantly seek the next moment and the nature of narrative. He suggests that our desire for endings stems from being 'narrative animals' and the inherent momentum of stories. He also touches on the balance between cherishing the present moment and longing for what has passed.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Donald Trump's economic approach, particularly his views on tariffs and trade, represents a significant departure from traditional American conservative economic philosophy. Trump's belief that America is a 'department store' being taken advantage of by other countries is seen as a form of left-wing economic thought, where experts and planners can direct the economy better than a free market. The article contrasts this with the classical liberal view that emphasizes individual and business knowledge over government planning.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's push for increased oil and gas production, the oil industry has faced challenges during his first 100 days in office.

Executives have expressed concerns about uncertainty and tariffs, leading to warnings of slowed investment in exploration, drilling, and production.
