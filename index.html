          <p>Ed Martin, the new Justice Department pardon attorney, has reportedly discussed pardon applications for the remaining January 6th defendants who did not receive full clemency from President Trump's first term. Peter Ticktin, an attorney working to secure pardons, met with Martin to discuss requests for Stewart Rhodes and 10 others. Martin posted about the meeting on X, signaling his willingness to consider the recommendations. Ticktin is also working with Mark McCloskey to file civil suits against the government for their treatment of Jan. 6 defendants, arguing they were used as pawns. Alice Johnson, Trump's "pardon czar," will also be consulted in the pardon process.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage and increased competition. CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities, including endorsing a far-right party in Germany and supporting Donald Trump in the U.S., have contributed to the brand's decline. Protests have erupted at Tesla dealerships across Europe in response to Musk's actions. While Tesla launched an upgraded Model Y, its aging lineup and the rise of traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD are posing challenges, as well as European consumer preference for hybrid vehicles.</p>

The State Department has maintained a "Level 4: Do Not Travel" advisory for Venezuela since February 2019.

Energy companies will pay out over £70m in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. The scandal erupted during the cost of living crisis when energy firms were found forcing their way into homes to install meters. Affected customers do not need to take action, as compensation will be paid directly into their accounts, but enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo.</p>

Shipping companies, many based in China, are offering ways to bypass tariffs by altering shipment information or transshipping goods through countries with lower tariffs. These schemes cost the U.S. government billions in lost revenue and frustrate honest companies. The Trump administration aims to combat trade fraud and is urging other countries to increase enforcement, but many believe the scale of illicit activity is overwhelming.</p>

Despite federal vouchers, many remain in unstable housing situations. Chu is advocating for FEMA to authorize a Direct Lease program to rent apartments for disaster survivors. Advocates argue that FEMA's data on available rental units is inaccurate, and the agency is ignoring barriers such as high-income requirements and landlords not accepting vouchers. The push for additional aid comes amid widespread cuts to FEMA and resistance from the Trump administration for disaster spending.</p>

          <p>Republican senators are increasingly pushing for stronger sanctions against Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine, a stance that diverges from President Trump's conciliatory approach. Senator Lindsey Graham is leading a bipartisan effort to pass legislation imposing sweeping sanctions on Moscow. Despite Trump hinting at a change in posture, it remains unclear whether this indicates a broader shift away from his desire to disengage from the conflict. Republicans are expressing frustration with Russia's intransigence and are calling for decisive action.</p>

The judge stated that an independent judiciary and bar are essential to the American system of justice. The order against WilmerHale cited the firm's previous employment of former special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>

The style, characterized by ornate displays and cheap extravagance, is linked to periods of economic bubbles and societal uncertainty.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the COVID vaccine will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, a significant departure from previous guidelines. The decision, which bypassed the CDC's standard recommendation process, was justified by a lack of clinical data supporting additional shots for healthy children. This decision has drawn criticism from public health experts, who emphasize the risks of severe disease and hospitalization for infants and pregnant women. Additionally, Trump moved to sever all government ties with Harvard and the administration continues its push to control trade.</p>
