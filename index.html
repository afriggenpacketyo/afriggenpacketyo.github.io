          <p>A family in South London reports feeling unsafe in their home after their neighbor allegedly threatened their father with a knife and damaged their property, including smashing a car windscreen. The family claims their housing association, Wandle, has not taken adequate action despite multiple reports and recorded evidence of the anti-social behavior. The housing association acknowledges the distress and states they are working with various agencies to resolve the issues and assess the need for enhanced security. Data from the housing ombudsman indicates a significant increase in complaints regarding social landlords' handling of anti-social behavior, highlighting a broader systemic issue of inadequate support for both victims and perpetrators, as the neighbor also deserves help with her mental health. The article also includes additional similar stories of people feeling unsafe in their homes due to the anti-social behavior of their neighbors.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, calling for international collaboration on trade despite increasing tariffs and other barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against politicizing trade or turning it into a security issue. Li stressed the importance of engaging in the international economy to reshape rules and order, urging countries to stay on the "right" path. Adam Tooze, a professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's comments as a call for a pluralization of global processes rather than focusing on who sets the order. The speech did not specifically address U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, but served as a general call for multilateral cooperation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's governing doctrine of unpredictability and its impact on international relations, particularly with NATO allies. Trump's disdain for European democracies and his transactional approach to alliances create uncertainty, especially amid the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East. European leaders are forced to balance appeasing Trump with contingency planning, striving to meet his demands for increased defense spending while remaining wary of his unreliable commitments. The article suggests that Trump's actions are often driven by personal motives rather than strategic calculations, leading to chaotic foreign policy decisions and a lack of stability for European allies. Ultimately, the author argues that Trump's unpredictability is a debilitating factor for international cooperation and defense.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attending the NATO Summit in The Hague, displaying a more amicable stance towards the alliance, which he has previously criticized. Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amidst discussions on defense spending and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Rutte congratulated Trump for increasing European defense spending and brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, with NATO members agreeing to a 5% GDP defense spending target. Despite this progress, Trump raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense clause, while U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker reassured allies of continued U.S. support.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy system could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the needed power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers propose a network leveraging regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents to areas with high demand. The article notes that while such a system could improve energy efficiency and ease decarbonization, its implementation would require navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises. The researchers emphasize that the potential of solar and wind resources vastly surpasses human demand, but intermittency issues need to be addressed to ensure reliable energy supply.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo after a strong initial showing, though no candidate reached the 50% threshold to win outright. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with a progressive platform focused on economic issues and social media virality. Cuomo conceded the primary, expressing intentions to consider an independent run in the November election. The primary outcome is subject to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected in July, and the winner will likely face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent.</p>

They describe studios targeting teenage pupils with promises of easy money, while some studios facilitate underage models by recycling old accounts or providing fake IDs. The global sexcam industry is booming, with Colombia having a large number of models and studios, but some models report abuse, pressure to perform certain acts, and low pay. While platforms claim to have checks to prevent underage performers, models say these are easily circumvented, and some viewers express a preference for younger-looking performers.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility, a popular online firm, went out of business, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These clinics act as intermediaries between patients, donors, and doctors, but the fertility watchdog, the HFEA, lacks the authority to regulate them because they do not directly provide IVF treatment. Several patients share their experiences of losing money and time due to Apricity's closure, highlighting the need for stronger legal protections for patients using these services. The HFEA is advocating for revisions to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to address the growing trend of fertility services offered through unregulated channels.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, leading to an apology from the ABC. Lattouf, who is of Lebanese heritage, said she was punished for her political opinion, and her dismissal triggered public outrage and questions over the ABC's independence. Justice Darryl Rangiah noted the sensitivity of the Israel-Gaza war in his remarks, highlighting the complexities of the case.</p>

          <p>A preliminary US intelligence assessment indicates that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by only a few months. The assessment, as reported by Reuters, contradicts President Trump's claim that the strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. The White House Press Secretary disputed the assessment, asserting that the strikes caused "total obliteration." The extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities remains unclear, and the report's findings have sparked debate and controversy.</p>
