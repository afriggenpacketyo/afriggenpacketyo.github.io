          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made a remarkable catch against the New York Mets, securing a crucial out in the fifth inning. After tracking a deep fly ball, Young collided with the wall, juggling the ball off his glove before kicking it back into the air with his foot to complete the catch. The play stunned the crowd and impressed his teammates, contributing to the Nationals' narrow 3-2 victory. The win was a setback for the Mets, who are currently competing for a National League Wildcard playoff spot.</p>

          <p>Christian Horner has officially departed from his role as team principal of Red Bull's Formula 1 team, reportedly receiving a severance payment of €60 million. His dismissal follows a tumultuous period that began with allegations of sexual harassment, of which he was twice cleared. The controversy, however, led to a significant power struggle and the departure of key personnel, including design chief Adrian Newey. Red Bull's corporate leadership decided to remove Horner after a decline in the team's performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to advise pregnant women against using Tylenol (acetaminophen) unless necessary for high fevers, citing a potential link to autism. This announcement follows President Trump's recent comments about a forthcoming "amazing" development regarding the condition. While some studies suggest a correlation, scientific consensus remains divided, and major medical groups maintain that acetaminophen is one of the safest pain relief options during pregnancy. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, has strongly refuted any causal link, emphasizing the health risks of untreated fever in expectant mothers.</p>

The U.S. lawmakers emphasized the need to recalibrate diplomatic, economic, and security relations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reform UK party has unveiled a proposal to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), which currently allows migrants to apply for permanent settlement after five years in the country. Under the new plan, migrants would need to reapply for visas every five years under stricter criteria, including higher salary and English language thresholds. The party also aims to restrict welfare access to British citizens only, claiming the changes would generate significant long-term savings. Critics, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, have disputed the financial projections and warned of potential disruption to businesses.</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," examines the outcomes of Black children raised in two-parent households, challenging a long-held policy assumption that marriage is a primary solution to racial inequality. Her research reveals that these children still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts from similar family structures, and fare only about as well as white children from single-parent homes. Cross argues that the singular focus on promoting two-parent families overlooks the impact of structural racism and diverts resources from more effective interventions, such as direct cash assistance and child care subsidies.</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop is experiencing significant growth, with its stock up roughly 60% year-to-date, defying broader retail downturns caused by tariffs and declining mall traffic. The company's success is attributed to its strategic focus on "kidulting," marketing nostalgic experiences to adults who grew up with the brand. By diversifying its locations beyond malls and planning ahead for tariff impacts, the company posted record revenue in the first half of the fiscal year. Analysts note that its constantly evolving product line also allows for discreet price increases, further bolstering its financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Climate activist Bill McKibben argues in his new book that despite the bleak political landscape under a second Trump administration, there is reason for optimism about climate change. The key driver is economics: solar and wind are now the cheapest energy sources globally, and their adoption is accelerating rapidly, particularly in places like California and even Texas. While the Trump administration's policies are ceding leadership in green technology to China, the sheer cost-effectiveness and local benefits of renewables are creating a powerful momentum that can outrun political opposition.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is calling for mandatory, cigarette-style health warnings on social media apps to alert young users to the potential risks to their mental health. Citing concerns over "addictive algorithms," the party also proposes a two-hour daily cap on "doomscrolling" through short-form video feeds for individuals under 18. The proposal aims to protect children from issues like anxiety, sleep disruption, and shortened attention spans linked to excessive social media use. This move is part of a broader political discussion in the UK about regulating technology to ensure online safety for minors.</p>

          <p>Emails obtained through a public records request reveal that CEO Elon Musk's announcements about launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area confused and concerned state regulators. Musk implied a rapid rollout of driverless vehicles, but Tesla had not applied for the necessary autonomous vehicle permits. The actual plan involved pre-arranged trips in human-driven cars under a limousine-style permit, which does not allow for on-demand ride-hailing. This discrepancy highlights the gap between Musk's public promises about autonomous technology and the company's current regulatory reality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal cleanup of the Eaton and Palisades wildfire debris has been hailed as the largest and fastest in U.S. history, clearing nearly 9,700 properties in eight months. However, many experts and residents now worry that this speed came at the cost of safety. A key decision by officials to skip post-cleanup soil testing has been criticized, as independent tests have found elevated levels of toxic metals like lead on properties already declared clear. While some can begin rebuilding quickly, others face potential long-term health risks.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting an aggressive campaign to recruit experienced local police officers, particularly in California, offering large signing bonuses and six-figure salaries. The agency has relaxed hiring requirements and is running ads targeting officers in "sanctuary cities." However, the effort is struggling in California, where high local police salaries make the federal positions less financially appealing. The poaching attempts have also created tension with local law enforcement leaders who are already facing their own staffing shortages.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are refusing to release a taxpayer-funded report on the seismic safety of the Gas Co. Tower, a downtown skyscraper they recently purchased for $200 million. Structural engineers have raised concerns that the "steel-moment-frame" building, constructed in 1991, might be unusable after a future major quake without a costly retrofit. The Board of Supervisors has suspended work related to the estimated $230 million upgrade, citing financial constraints, while insisting the building already exceeds safety requirements, leaving the public uninformed about potential risks.</p>

The device, made by SetPoint Medical, sends electrical pulses to the nerve for one minute each day, which signals the brain and spleen to reduce the production of inflammatory proteins. In clinical trials, the treatment provided meaningful improvement for a significant portion of patients with severe, drug-resistant arthritis. This approval marks a potential turning point for bioelectronic medicine in treating autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>Tangier Island, a historic crabbing community in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay, is at risk of being completely submerged within the next 50 years due to climate change. The island has already lost two-thirds of its landmass since 1850 from a combination of sea-level rise, erosion, and regional land subsidence. Despite the dire predictions and its unique culture, residents feel they have not received adequate government help to protect their home. Experts estimate a full restoration and protection project would cost hundreds of millions, leaving its future uncertain.</p>
