          <p>An 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, from Japan to the Americas. The first waves reaching Hawaii were relatively small, measuring around four feet, but authorities warned the event could last for hours with a series of powerful waves. Shelters were opened, and residents were urged to move inland as a precaution. The event is one of the strongest earthquakes recorded globally in recent years, prompting widespread alerts and evacuations in coastal regions.</p>

          <p>Double Olympic gold medalist Laura Dahlmeier has been seriously injured in a climbing accident in Pakistan's Karakoram mountains. The 31-year-old was caught in a rockfall at an altitude of approximately 5,700 meters. Her mountaineering partner was able to call for emergency services, but rescue efforts have been hampered by the remote location and bad weather. The Pakistan army is assisting in the rescue operation for the celebrated athlete and experienced mountaineer.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire and takes steps to end the war in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "abate the suffering" and advance a two-state solution. The decision was immediately criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a reward for terrorism, while UK opposition parties were divided on the timing. This policy shift marks a significant change in British foreign policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, doubling its earnings from the previous year and surpassing forecasts. The strong performance was driven by its investment bank and global wealth management divisions, which benefited from market volatility. Despite the positive results, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients maintain a "wait-and-see" attitude amid geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. The integration of Credit Suisse remains on track, though the bank continues to contest proposed Swiss capital regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off the coast of Russia, California braced for tsunami waves, with the most severe warnings issued for the northern part of the state. Officials predicted waves could reach up to 4.8 feet in Crescent City, an area historically vulnerable to tsunamis, while Southern California was expected to see much smaller waves. Authorities urged residents to stay away from beaches and harbors due to the risk of strong, unpredictable currents. The article details the expected timing and size of the waves along the coast.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is set to hold a three-day investigative hearing into the January midair collision between a regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crash, which killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft, is the deadliest U.S. aviation accident in over two decades. The hearing will examine the crowded airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), potential equipment malfunctions, and air traffic control communications. The NTSB's goal is fact-finding to issue safety recommendations.</p>
