          <p>A deadly ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, has left two people, believed to be fire personnel, dead. Firefighters responding to a growing brush fire on Canfield Mountain were attacked by at least one shooter, leading to an active shooter situation and a shelter-in-place order. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office confirmed they were taking fire from multiple directions, hampering firefighting efforts and the search for the suspect. Authorities, with FBI assistance, are investigating whether the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders into a trap.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, Japan, has come forward with allegations that she was sexually assaulted by her former boss, a chief prosecutor, in 2018. The case, which has drawn comparisons to other prominent MeToo stories in Japan, highlights the significant backlash she faced, including pressure to remain silent and slander from a colleague. After initially admitting to the charge, the accused has since recanted, claiming the encounter was consensual, stalling the trial. The accuser continues to fight for justice, also calling for an independent review of the prosecutorial office's handling of her case and subsequent harassment claims.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is increasing its efforts to combat a significant rise in attacks against religious facilities, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon described the assaults on churches, synagogues, and mosques as a form of terrorism intended to intimidate faith communities. The department has recently secured lengthy prison sentences in several cases involving planned attacks on houses of worship. This renewed focus aims to ensure that people of faith are not seen as soft targets in the United States.</p>

          <p>Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, a top Shiite cleric in Iran, has issued a fatwa against President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The religious decree labels anyone challenging the Islamic community's unity as a "mohareb," or one who wages war against God, a crime punishable by death under Iranian law. This act has been condemned by some experts as a state-sanctioned incitement to global terrorism. The fatwa follows a recent period of intense conflict, including American and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

Enthusiasts use trail cams and forensic techniques in the Tasmanian bush, driven by a passionate belief that the creature still exists. Meanwhile, a separate scientific endeavor is attempting to bring the animal back through de-extinction, using the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists are skeptical of both efforts, the search highlights a powerful blend of hope, remorse for the species' loss, and human fascination with the unknown.</p>

He believes in the value of "good criminal energy" for filmmaking, having once stolen a camera to start his career.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) product could leave some savers with less money than they originally invested. LISAs, designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement, offer a 25% government bonus but impose a steep penalty for early withdrawals. This penalty can result in a 6.25% loss of the individual's own capital, a situation that is becoming more common. The Treasury Committee also raised concerns that the complex product may be unsuitable for some and could have been mis-sold to benefit claimants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, once considered one of the safest modern aircraft, is facing renewed scrutiny following a recent fatal crash and a history of production issues. While the plane has flown over a billion passengers without a major incident for over a decade, whistleblowers have repeatedly raised alarms about quality control and manufacturing defects at its South Carolina plant. Allegations include the use of substandard parts and shortcuts in assembly processes that could compromise the aircraft's long-term structural integrity. Boeing has consistently denied these claims, but the issues have led to significant production halts and ongoing regulatory oversight.</p>

The "danmei" genre has a large following among young women in China, offering a creative outlet to explore themes of desire outside traditional gendered realities. The crackdown has sparked a rare online debate about censorship and has been linked to a broader push by Beijing to promote traditional family values.</p>

          <p>A week after U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the attack's effectiveness. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the facilities were "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments suggested the strikes only set back Iran's program by months. The administration's stated goals also appeared to shift, with officials later emphasizing that the attack successfully induced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, rather than focusing solely on the destruction of nuclear capabilities. This evolving narrative has led to ongoing questions about the true extent of the damage and the primary objectives of the military action.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek re-election, a day after voting against President Donald Trump's signature budget legislation. Tillis, who cited the decline of independent, bipartisan thinking in Washington, drew Trump's ire for opposing the bill due to its "devastating" cuts to Medicaid funding for his state. Trump had criticized Tillis and threatened to back a primary challenger against him. Tillis's departure highlights the intense pressure within the Republican party to align with the former president's agenda and the political consequences for those who dissent.</p>
