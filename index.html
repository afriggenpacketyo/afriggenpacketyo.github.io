          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily delayed an order that would have required the Trump administration to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. This follows a lower court's temporary restraining order blocking Trump's deployment of National Guard troops during protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The appeals court panel, including judges nominated by both Trump and Biden, has scheduled a hearing for June 17 to further consider the matter. Newsom expressed gratification at the initial ruling, stating he would return the National Guard to previous duties like border security and counter-drug enforcement.</p>

The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8bn a year by 2029/30 to spend on raising standards in the state sector.</p>

          <p>Christian music star Michael Tait, known for the song "God's Not Dead," has been accused of sexual assault by three men, with allegations of drugging and molestation. Four others have alleged inappropriate behavior, including unwanted touching and sexual advances. Tait admitted to a "double life" involving alcohol, cocaine, and unwanted sensual contact with men, responding to similar allegations investigated by The Roys Report. The allegations contrast with Tait's public image and have sparked discussions about abuse within the Christian music industry, where Tait's music promoted sobriety and sexual purity.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Israel Inflicts Unprecedented Damage on Iran's Elite</h2>

          <p>Israel's recent attack on Iran has inflicted unprecedented damage on Iran's elite, targeting key members of its leadership and military infrastructure. The operation's intensity and scope surpass previous attacks, adopting a strategy similar to the Israeli offensive against Hezbollah. The killing of top military officials and nuclear scientists is expected to necessitate a fiercer response from Iran, though the attack may also hinder Tehran's ability to mount such a response. This escalation in the conflict is likely based on Netanyahu's calculations of Iran's diminished capacity to retaliate effectively.</p>

          <p>San Francisco families are expressing outrage after learning that $3.8 million in donations meant to build playgrounds were allegedly misused by the San Francisco Parks Alliance (SFPA). The SFPA abruptly closed amid allegations of mismanagement, including funneling funds to general operating expenses and awarding bonuses despite a deficit. Donors, like Nicola Miner, feel betrayed, as the promised playgrounds never materialized. The scandal has prompted a city review and highlighted the importance of due diligence when donating to nonprofits.</p>
