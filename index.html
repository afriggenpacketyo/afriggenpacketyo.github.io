          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved amendments to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day traders, a change now pending SEC approval. This rule, established in 2001 during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain this balance. The new proposal replaces the fixed minimum with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, reflecting advancements in technology and market access. This regulatory shift could make active trading more accessible to smaller retail investors and potentially boost activity for brokerage firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex's CEO questioning the company's decision to host President Donald Trump at the U.S. Open. The letter suggests the invitation may be an attempt to "curry favor" and secure exemptions from the 39% tariff the Trump administration recently imposed on Swiss exports. Warren's inquiry draws parallels to actions by other companies like Apple and Nvidia, which have made domestic investments following interactions with the president. The White House dismissed the concerns as "asinine conspiracy theories," while Rolex declined to comment on the matter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a homeowner with a $250,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520. This is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year, which were above 7%. Over the full 30-year term of the loan, this lower rate could save a borrower around $54,000 in total interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least twenty people were injured after a drone launched from Yemen struck the southern Israeli resort town of Eilat. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the strike and that attempts were made to intercept the drone. While the Yemeni Houthi group has not officially claimed responsibility, they have frequently launched missiles and drones toward Israel in solidarity with Palestinians. This attack represents one of the most serious in terms of casualties from such strikes, prompting Israel's Defense Minister to vow a strong response against those who harm the country.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How Charlie Kirk's Death is Perceived as a 'George Floyd Moment' on the Right</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 14:14:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An interview with conservative author Tanner Greer explores the profound impact of Charlie Kirk's death on the American right, framing him as an "indispensable man" for the MAGA movement. Greer argues that beyond his controversial broadcasts, Kirk was a master organizer who symbolized a vision of winning political battles on the left's own turf. His killing is seen by many conservatives as proof that the left cannot coexist with them, fueling a desire for a cultural reckoning similar to the left's "George Floyd moment" in 2020.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retired Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce has voiced his strong dislike for the NFL's expanded jersey number rules, particularly for defensive players. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce expressed frustration that numbers no longer signify a player's position as they traditionally did. He stated a preference for the old system where he could identify a player's role simply by their jersey number. Kelce specifically lamented seeing defensive linemen and linebackers wearing single-digit numbers, arguing that players at the line of scrimmage should wear "big" numbers.</p>

          <p>A satirical statue depicting President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands was installed on the National Mall in Washington D.C. but was removed by U.S. Park Police in less than 24 hours. The piece, titled "Best Friends Forever," was placed by an art collective called The Secret Handshake, which accused the administration of illegally removing it. A Department of the Interior spokesperson stated the statue was removed for not complying with its permit, though specifics were not provided. The White House criticized the artwork, while acknowledging that Trump had previously banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid, as a potential treatment for some children with autism, particularly those with speech difficulties. The theory suggests some children have a blockage preventing folate from reaching the brain, which leucovorin can bypass. While several small, controlled studies have shown positive effects on speech, researchers emphasize that more funding and larger clinical trials are needed for FDA approval. The drug is currently available off-label, offering hope to families, but challenges remain regarding funding for research on this inexpensive, non-patentable medicine.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" have increased by 70% in the United States. The rise is primarily driven by a gene known as NDM, which makes bacteria resistant to carbapenems, a class of last-resort antibiotics. While the total number of cases is still relatively small, the rate of NDM-variety infections has jumped over 460% since 2019. Researchers suggest the surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to this worrisome trend in antimicrobial resistance.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low following a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to consider several key questions before entering the market. Buyers should first determine the actual interest rate they are eligible for, as it can vary based on credit score and lender. Secondly, they should explore alternatives like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) that could secure an even lower rate. Finally, they must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to fall further against the possibility of them rising again, as has happened in the recent past. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge noted that the complaint was based on subjective expectations of how the products should have looked.</p>

          <p>An editorial from The Guardian analyzes President Trump's recent shift in tone regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, where he suggested Kyiv could achieve a total victory. This change is viewed as a welcome development compared to his previous stance, which leaned towards appeasement. However, the article argues that Trump's motives are likely rooted in self-interest rather than a commitment to democracy, and his history of unreliability means this new position cannot be depended upon. The piece concludes that while this presents a strategic opportunity for Ukraine's allies, they must seize it with the understanding that it may be short-lived.</p>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam. While previous studies showed AI could pass the first two levels, it struggled with the essay-based questions of the Level III exam. Researchers from NYU and GoodFin tested 23 large language models and found that top-tier models could pass mock Level III exams in minutes, a task that typically takes humans over 1,000 hours of study. This development highlights the rapid advancement of AI's analytical reasoning capabilities in specialized professional fields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who spent 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, has been awarded a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood. Hastings was exonerated in 2022 after new DNA evidence identified another suspect, Kenneth Packnett, who had died in prison in 2020. A subsequent lawsuit revealed that an Inglewood detective had allegedly falsified evidence and ignored information pointing to Packnett at the time of the original investigation.

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the United States surged by 20.5% in August, reaching the fastest pace since early 2022. This significant and unexpected increase is attributed to builders offering price discounts and other incentives to attract buyers. Easing mortgage rates, in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, also likely contributed to the spike in activity. While this signals a potential burst of activity, analysts caution that new homes represent a small portion of the overall housing market, which remains constrained by broader affordability challenges.

With many major emitters potentially falling short of their climate pledges and planned fossil fuel projects threatening to exceed climate limits, responsible politicians must accelerate the clean energy transition while actively reducing carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairperson Brendan Carr is facing criticism for pressuring Disney to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel over comments made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Carr's threat, delivered on a right-wing podcast, suggested the FCC could take action against the company if Kimmel was not disciplined. This move, which led to Kimmel's temporary suspension, is seen by critics as an implementation of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook, which Carr helped author, to use government power to suppress critical political speech. The action has turned Kimmel into a symbol of free speech.</p>
