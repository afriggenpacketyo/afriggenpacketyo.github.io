        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial, Cassie Ventura faced rigorous cross-examination regarding her relationship with Combs. Defense attorneys presented text messages suggesting a consensual and affectionate dynamic, challenging Ventura's claims of coercion and sexual assault. The messages spanned a decade, depicting Ventura's expressions of love and willingness to participate in what she described as drug-fueled orgies. The defense aimed to undermine Ventura's credibility by portraying her as an active participant in Combs' lifestyle, rather than a victim of sexual assault. The trial continues with Ventura's testimony expected to conclude soon, amid concerns about her pregnancy. </p>

          <p>A wildfire in eastern Arizona, dubbed the Greer Fire, has rapidly spread to over 9,500 acres with 0% containment, fueled by high winds and dry vegetation. The fire, which started near the community of Greer, is moving north and has prompted evacuations and road closures, including Highway 260. More than 400 personnel are working to combat the blaze, which has already destroyed multiple structures. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs expressed support for those affected and gratitude for the firefighters' efforts, as the fire continues to move through Hobson Canyon and onto state trust lands.</p>

The union, representing about 460 members, is seeking pay raises after five years without an increase, while NJ Transit aims for a deal that is fair to both workers and taxpayers. A potential strike would affect over 300,000 commuters, prompting Governor Phil Murphy to consider declaring a state of emergency.

The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation. FDA officials are seeking more clinical data before approving Novavax's Covid vaccine, and are also questioning the CDC's data on the impact of Covid on children under 12.

          <h2>Retailers, Including Walmart and Mattel, to Increase Prices Due to Trade War</h2>

          <p>Walmart, Mattel, and other retailers are set to increase prices due to the trade war with China, signaling that consumers will bear the brunt of the tariffs. Walmart executives warned of unavoidable price increases on goods such as vegetables and furniture, while Mattel announced it would boost prices to offset higher costs. The situation has worsened as businesses have passed production costs down to their customers. Consumer spending has slowed, and shoppers are beginning to feel the effects of the tariffs, with some stocking up on goods in anticipation of rising costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship, which would limit U.S. citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The case also addresses the legality of individual district court judges issuing nationwide injunctions. Justices questioned the implications of eliminating nationwide injunctions and the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in place for extended periods. The court's decision could have significant implications for immigration policy and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

The FAA's deputy head of air traffic control emphasized that there was no loss of separation between airplanes during the outage, but the event highlights concerns about the aging infrastructure of the air traffic control network.</p>

          <p>Charl Kleinhaus, a white South African farmer, defends his refugee status in the US, granted under President Trump's policy to protect Afrikaners from alleged discrimination. Kleinhaus says he left South Africa after receiving death threats and facing land expropriation, leaving behind his home and family. He rejects claims that he is an opportunist, arguing that he sought refuge to protect his children. The South African government dismisses the claim of persecution, with President Ramaphosa calling the group "cowards." The resettlement is controversial due to Trump's broader crackdown on immigration and Kleinhaus's past antisemitic social media posts.</p>
