          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in a pro-Palestinian march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The demonstration proceeded after receiving last-minute authorization from the NSW Supreme Court, which overruled a police rejection based on safety and traffic concerns. The event, which included notable figures like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, highlighted growing public pressure on the Australian government regarding its stance on the conflict. Organizers praised the court's decision as historic, while police managed the large crowds amidst heavy rain.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an investigation after allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, "Strictly Come Dancing." The claims were reportedly made in a legal submission from a former celebrity contestant, prompting the corporation to hire an external law firm to assist with the probe. This inquiry comes amid a series of controversies surrounding the show's talent and follows the recent implementation of new welfare measures to better support participants. The BBC stated it has clear protocols for handling such serious complaints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German consumer rights group, vzbv, has initiated legal action against several budget airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, arguing their hand luggage fees are unlawful. The lawsuit contends that charging extra for reasonably sized carry-on bags misleads consumers about the true cost of flights and violates a 2014 European Court of Justice ruling. The court previously determined that hand luggage is a fundamental necessity of air travel, not an optional extra. This legal challenge is part of a wider, Europe-wide campaign for greater price transparency.</p>

          <p>Train services have resumed on the critical railway line between Düsseldorf and Duisburg in western Germany after successful repairs from a suspected arson attack. The incident, which damaged vital signaling cables, is being treated as sabotage, with police believing left-wing extremists are responsible. A leftist group has claimed responsibility for the disruption on one of Germany's busiest rail connections, which serves over 620 passenger trains daily. The state's interior minister noted the group has a history of similar acts in the region.</p>

          <p>Germany is planning to introduce a new regulation allowing for the use of electronic ankle tags on violent offenders to better protect their victims, particularly in cases of domestic abuse. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig announced that the system, based on a successful Spanish model, will enable the real-time monitoring of an offender's proximity to a victim. This proactive measure allows family courts to order the use of a tag, aiming to prevent further violence and provide a greater sense of security for those under threat.</p>

The incident occurred in the 11th minute of the game against Necaxa, when Messi pulled up and sat on the field before limping off under his own power. After the match, which Miami won in a penalty shootout, manager Javier Mascherano confirmed Messi felt discomfort and will be evaluated further. This adds to a series of fitness issues the 38-year-old has faced since joining the MLS club.</p>

          <p>Ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, families of children born with congenital Zika syndrome continue to face immense challenges, as many of the children's health conditions have deteriorated over time. In Maceió, the epicenter of the crisis, affected mothers have formed powerful support networks to navigate the healthcare system and care for their children, who often cannot walk, talk, or eat independently. These mothers recently achieved a major victory, successfully lobbying to overturn a presidential veto and secure significantly higher long-term compensation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has adjourned for its August recess without reaching a bipartisan agreement to advance dozens of President Donald Trump's nominees. Democrats have been blocking unanimous consent votes, forcing a lengthy and time-consuming process for each confirmation, which led to a contentious standoff. Negotiations broke down after Trump publicly rejected a potential deal and attacked Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, prompting Republicans to suggest they may seek to change Senate rules to speed up confirmations in September.</p>

Many women reflect on how the film made them feel seen and inspired them, while its legacy is also viewed in the context of the massive growth of women's football in the two decades since its release.</p>

          <p>The fashion trend of visible tan lines is gaining popularity, but it has a dangerous side, with many people intentionally getting sunburned to achieve the look. While some influencers promote safe methods using fake tan, social media is also filled with images of severe sunburns, driven by a desire for crisp lines. Health experts are expressing alarm over this trend, which is coupled with a rise in online misinformation that falsely claims sunscreen is harmful. This creates a perfect storm for increased skin cancer risk, as melanoma rates in the UK continue to climb.</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming 80th anniversary parade for the end of World War II. One prominent researcher suggested that Modi's presence, alongside Russia, could provide a valuable opportunity to resolve ongoing China-India border disputes. However, most observers believe that despite a recent thaw in diplomatic relations between the two nations, Modi's attendance remains unlikely. The potential visit is seen as a significant but improbable step in normalizing the complex relationship.</p>

          <p>The violent arrest of a Black college student in Jacksonville, Florida, captured by his own dashboard-mounted cellphone, has sparked an internal investigation and renewed calls for citizens to record police interactions. The video provided a clear, unique vantage point of the traffic stop, showing an officer smashing the car window and striking the student, details not clearly visible in police bodycam footage. Civil rights attorneys argue the incident demonstrates how citizen-recorded video can provide crucial context and challenge official police reports.</p>

          <p>An extensive interview with David Berkowitz, the serial killer known as "Son of Sam" who terrorized New York City in the 1970s, delves into his motivations and life decades after his crimes. Berkowitz discusses his troubled past, his claims of demonic influence, and his conversion to Christianity in prison, where he now serves as a minister. The article contrasts his expressed remorse with the enduring pain of his surviving victims and their families, who remain skeptical of his transformation. Investigators also reaffirm their belief that he acted alone, dismissing his claims of cult involvement.</p>

Investigators had interviewed 52 other customers from that day, but the two men, who were seen acting suspiciously just before closing, were never identified and never came forward, raising suspicion they may hold the key to the case.</p>
