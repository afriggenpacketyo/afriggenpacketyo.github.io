          <p>Archaeologists have painstakingly pieced together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster, revealing remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London. Discovered in 2021, the frescoes, depicting musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, adorned at least 20 walls. The artwork provides insights into the affluence of the area, dubbed the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," during the Roman era. The team hopes to find the missing fragment bearing the artist's name, which is scored with the Latin word 'Fecit', meaning 'has made this'.</p>

Refusal to grant access to social media accounts set to "public" may result in visa rejection, raising concerns about censorship and chilling legitimate political speech.

          <p>Martin Kettle discusses the complexities and potential pitfalls of regime change in Iran, arguing that while the current theocratic regime is repressive and destabilizing, overthrowing it is not a simple solution. He highlights the potential for civic instability and the lack of a clear successor government. Kettle cautions against intervention based solely on animosity towards the current regime or alignment with specific political agendas, emphasizing the lessons learned from past interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. The author underscores that destroying a regime does not guarantee successful regime change.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs amid rising tariffs. This legal practice involves modifying a product's materials or dimensions to fit into a different tariff classification. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and Columbia Sportswear adding zippered pockets to shirts for tariff exemptions. While legal, this strategy requires careful navigation of over 5,000 product classification codes. (not investment advice)</p>
