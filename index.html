          <p>Apple reported strong second fiscal-quarter earnings, exceeding overall Wall Street expectations, although the Services division revenue was slightly below estimates. The article notes that iPhone revenue was strong, but the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category declined. CEO Tim Cook addressed the impact of tariffs, expecting a $900 million cost increase in the current quarter, and mentioned shifting some iPhone production to India and other products to Vietnam to mitigate tariff effects. Apple authorized $100 billion in share repurchases and increased its dividend by 4%.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by cloud computing and advertising growth, but issued softer guidance for the current period, causing the stock to fall. The article highlights that Amazon's guidance noted tariffs and trade policies as factors that could impact results, a departure from the previous quarter's guidance. Amazon faces significant exposure to tariffs due to sourcing some products from China, which has been hit with aggressive levies. AWS revenue came in just below estimates for the third consecutive quarter, though advertising revenue was a bright spot, rising 19% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a budget deal that would significantly weaken oversight of religious schools, particularly Hasidic Jewish schools, potentially allowing them to continue receiving taxpayer dollars without providing a basic secular education. The article details that the state may lower standards for demonstrating compliance with education law, sparking concern from education experts like State Education Commissioner Betty Rosa. This proposal follows years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders who view government oversight as a threat. A 2022 New York Times investigation revealed that many Hasidic yeshivas fail to provide adequate secular education despite receiving substantial government funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that any country or person buying oil or petrochemicals from Iran will be subject to secondary sanctions and barred from doing business with the U.S. The article notes that this announcement caused U.S. crude oil futures to rise. Trump accused Iran of financing militant groups and reiterated his goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. An analyst suggests that Trump's comments are directed at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, but that the sanctions may not impact oil flows unless Beijing's state-owned enterprises are targeted.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that medications like semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic), commonly used for diabetes and obesity, may offer benefits for patients with fatty liver disease (MASH).

Dr. Celine Gounder notes that semaglutide reduced liver inflammation in almost two-thirds of patients and liver scarring in over a third.

DHS stated that agents seized electronic devices and have not ruled out the current occupants' involvement in the smuggling ring. The Independent and Rep.

          <p>David Brooks reflects on the resurgence of "pagan" values in contemporary politics, particularly in the Trump administration, characterized by a celebration of power, ego, and callousness. The article draws a parallel between these values and those of ancient Rome, contrasting them with Judeo-Christian ethics emphasizing compassion and humility. Brooks argues that this pagan ethos threatens the foundations of democracy and calls for a recommitment to rehumanizing influences like art, literature, and selfless service. He notes a possible spiritual yearning in response to the failures of science, technology, and hyper-individualism to provide meaning.</p>

The lawsuits argue that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA authority over air emissions, displacing states' ability to regulate greenhouse gases beyond their borders.

While gold generally gains value during recessions, it is not immune to short-term price fluctuations and is influenced by factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and market sentiment.
