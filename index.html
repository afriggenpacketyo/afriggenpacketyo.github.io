          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh. This arrangement follows the blocking of Nippon Steel's bid by former President Biden and a subsequent national security review. Trump claims the partnership will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Shares of U.S. Steel surged on the news. The deal is pending further clarification regarding ownership structure and has faced opposition from the United Steelworkers union. (not investment advice)</p>

The departing partners include Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, who represent major companies and have held significant roles in high-profile investigations.

          <p>President Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top buyers of his meme coin, with attendees spending a combined $148 million on the token to attend. However, some attendees found the event underwhelming, citing poor food and limited interaction with Trump, who only made a brief appearance. Despite the presence of luxury items like Richard Mille watches, the atmosphere was muted, with many attendees focused on the coin's price movements. Security was reportedly lax, and phones were not secured. The price of Trump's meme coin dropped 16% following the event.</p>

          <p>Singer Billy Joel has canceled upcoming concerts due to being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. involves excess cerebrospinal fluid buildup in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is rare but more common with age and is often underdiagnosed. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that bypasses the blocked channel and allows fluid to drain, often combined with physical therapy to improve gait stability.</p>

The judge issued a temporary restraining order, and a hearing is scheduled for May 29.

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt can lead to serious financial consequences, including significant damage to your credit score, which can remain on your credit report for up to seven years. Default typically occurs after 180 days of missed payments, but even a single missed payment can negatively impact your credit. Once in default, the debt may be charged off and sold to a collection agency, increasing the risk of legal action, wage garnishment, and bank account levies. Exploring options like debt relief programs or credit counseling can help mitigate the long-term damage.</p>

          <p>Tax relief strategies, such as installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, and Currently Not Collectible status, can halt IRS wage garnishment by resolving unpaid tax debt. Acting quickly and choosing the right strategy is crucial. The IRS typically won't garnish wages while a request for an Offer in Compromise or Currently Not Collectible status is pending. If your wages are already being garnished, immediate action is essential, such as verifying the debt and contacting the IRS to negotiate a resolution.</p>
