          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the company at $3.3 billion. The pricing exceeded the expected range, indicating strong investor demand despite the company reporting significant financial losses in recent years. The successful IPO is seen as a key test for the crypto market's vitality, especially following a recent consolidation in the prices of major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of an effort to address crime in the city. This follows a similar federalization of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and comes after the president had previously suggested a deployment to Chicago. The move faces potential legal hurdles and opposition from local and state officials who have resisted the idea of using military troops for domestic law enforcement in their jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the problematic relationship between student teacher evaluations and grade inflation in American universities. It argues that because these evaluations can significantly impact a professor's pay, hiring, and tenure prospects, faculty are incentivized to lighten workloads and give higher grades to receive better scores. This dynamic creates a 'doom loop' where educational rigor may be compromised in favor of positive student feedback, a trend supported by research showing little correlation between high evaluation scores and actual student learning.</p>

          <h2>Retailers and Resellers Note Shift in Clothing Sizes Amid Weight-Loss Drug Popularity</h2>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is having a noticeable impact on the apparel industry, dubbed the 'Ozempic effect.' Clothing resellers are reporting a significant increase in donations of larger-sized clothing, while demand for smaller sizes is growing. This shift is causing some retailers to reconsider their inventory strategies, with fewer extended sizes appearing on physical racks and a greater focus on online availability for the plus-size market, reflecting a rapid change in consumer body sizes.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have issued a warning that the United States' secretive X-37B space plane could be armed and used to 'kill' targets in orbit, escalating the militarization of space. While the U.S. military states the reusable, uncrewed vehicle is for testing advanced technologies like space-based laser communications and quantum navigation, its capabilities and missions remain largely classified. The concerns reflect growing international tensions and the potential for an arms race in space between global powers.</p>

          <p>The UK prime minister is facing significant backlash from within the Labour Party over the appointment and subsequent rapid dismissal of Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States. Mandelson was fired after new information emerged about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The episode, described by one MP as a 'shambles,' has led to calls for accountability, with much of the blame being directed at the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, for his role in the controversial appointment.</p>

          <p>Recent waves of online trolling directed at prominent women like Princess Kate, singer Nelly Furtado, and German politician Annalena Baerbock are being examined as evidence of pervasive sexism. The article notes that public commentary on these women disproportionately focuses on their physical appearance, from hair color to body weight. Media experts argue this reflects a deep-seated power structure where women, regardless of their professional achievements, are primarily judged by their looks, a standard that is not applied as harshly to men.</p>

Former detainees allege medical neglect and abuse, while data shows individuals are often held far longer than the facility's 72-hour short-term designation allows.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the assassination of Charlie Kirk is being leveraged by prominent conservatives to call for a widespread government crackdown on political opponents. The author expresses concern that figures in the MAGA movement are framing the killing as part of a war initiated by 'the radical left,' potentially setting the stage for repressive federal action. The piece contends that while Kirk's views were reprehensible to many, his killing should not become a pretext for dismantling free speech and democratic norms.</p>

However, it also questions the validity of these claims and highlights the significant risks for the Venezuelan opposition in appearing to invite American military intervention in the region.</p>
