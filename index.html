          <p>Tesla has signed an agreement to construct China's largest grid-scale battery power plant, marking its first such deal in the country amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), involves collaboration between Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. The grid-side energy storage power station will function as a smart regulator for urban electricity, addressing power supply pressures and ensuring stable electricity demand, with the Shanghai factory having already produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of the year. The project is expected to be the largest of its kind in China upon completion, offering up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours per Megapack. The ability to adjust grid resources is considered a major factor in the plant's overall design.</p>

          <p>Circle's stock price has surged following the Senate's approval of the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shares of Circle rose significantly after the bill passed the Senate and moved to the House of Representatives, with Coinbase shares also climbing due to their revenue share from Circle's USDC reserves. The GENIUS Act aims to modernize dollar payment rails, improve transparency, and promote dollar dominance, potentially attracting interest from major companies like Amazon and Walmart who are reportedly exploring stablecoins. Alex Thorn from Galaxy Digital noted the bill's potential to bring traditional finance onto public blockchains, fostering wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Silver prices are experiencing a significant surge, leading investors to consider its potential as a viable alternative to gold. Since the start of the year, silver has risen by 28%, driven by strong industrial demand, especially in solar panels. While gold has traditionally been viewed as an income protector, silver presents a more affordable entry point for investors looking to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. Financial experts recommend a mix of precious metals, including silver, up to 10% of an overall portfolio, but the choice between gold and silver depends on individual budget and goals.

The Ministry of Defence is working with Thames Valley Police to investigate the breach, while Defence Secretary John Healey has ordered a wider security review.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, questioning the waiver that allows California to exceed federal pollution standards. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has vowed to sue in response, arguing the state's right to set its own emission standards is crucial for cutting greenhouse gases. Environmentalists argue that California's standards have driven vehicle innovation and public health benefits, but the ruling allows for further legal challenges.</p>

She highlights her commitment to prioritizing qualifications over party affiliation when confirming presidential appointments, citing her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation as an example. Murkowski expresses hope that her story will inspire others to engage in public service and prioritize problem-solving over ideological purity, and she encourages voters to elect individuals dedicated to solving problems and representing their constituents' needs.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel has prompted questions about the stability of the Islamist regime in Tehran. While the regime has used the conflict to rally support, its failure to protect top officials has raised doubts among the public. Experts suggest that a potential collapse depends on the presence of a viable political alternative, but the Iranian opposition remains divided. The conflict has also reignited nationalist rhetoric, though it is difficult to gauge the true sentiments of the Iranian people amidst fear and anger. The article concludes by noting the divided stance of the West and the uncertainty surrounding Trump's decision.</p>

          <p>The draft law legalizing assisted dying in certain circumstances in England and Wales has passed through the House of Commons and now moves to the House of Lords. Peers will scrutinize the bill, and MPs will have a final say after considering any changes suggested by the Lords. Supporters are optimistic about the bill's passage, but opponents may attempt to block it or cause delays. The government remains neutral on the bill, but concerns persist about parliamentary time and potential disagreements between the Houses, which could impact the timeline for implementation.</p>

          <p>The vote by MPs to approve Kim Leadbeater's assisted dying bill is a landmark moment, potentially the biggest vote regarding bodily autonomy since the legalization of abortion in Great Britain. The bill now moves to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, and the government estimates it could take up to four years to set up an assisted dying service. The proposals would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of less than six months to request an assisted death, subject to multiple declarations, medical assessments, and approval from a multidisciplinary panel. The process is anticipated to take up to two months, raising concerns about potential delays for those nearing the end of life.</p>

While Waller believes import taxes will cause a one-time price increase, companies may delay passing increased costs to consumers, leading to a more significant price shock. Rising crude oil prices and a declining dollar also signal future inflationary pressures. Waller cited rising unemployment among recent college graduates as a concern, but technological changes displacing entry-level workers may render interest rate reductions ineffective.

While Labour ministers argue the current system reinforces the divide between deprived places and the rest of the country, rural councils have raised concerns about potential losses.
