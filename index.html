          <p>President Trump suggested a willingness to lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks in Switzerland, a significant reduction from the current 145% on many Chinese goods. The Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is expected to engage with Chinese counterparts to potentially foster trade stability. Despite this, Trump emphasized the need for China to open its markets to the U.S., as closed markets are no longer viable. The latest data reveals a substantial decline in goods moving from China to the U.S., raising concerns about potential price increases and shortages.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses President Trump's trade negotiations, highlighting an agreement with Britain and upcoming talks with China led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The White House faces pressure to ease its protectionist agenda as companies warn of profit erosion due to the trade war. While Trump touts the British deal as a turning point, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cautions that negotiations with Japan and South Korea will be slow. China's exports to the U.S. have plummeted, signaling a shift in trade dynamics, and the Fed is likely to maintain its interest-rate policy until economic volatility subsides.</p>

They propose boosting interagency cooperation, expanding inspections at border crossings, increasing law enforcement efforts against straw purchasers, and bolstering intelligence-sharing with Mexican authorities. The lawmakers emphasize that stopping the flow of American-made guns into Mexico is crucial to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Between 200,000 and 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year.</p>
