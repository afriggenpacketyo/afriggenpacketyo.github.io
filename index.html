          <p>A shooting in Uppsala, Sweden, resulted in the deaths of three individuals at a hair salon near Vaksala Square. The shooter fled the scene on a scooter, prompting a large-scale police investigation involving a helicopter and temporary suspension of train services. Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer condemned the act as a "brutal act of violence," amid growing concerns over increasing shootings and gang-related incidents in Sweden, leading to calls for stricter gun laws. The identities of the victims and the shooter remain unknown as the investigation continues. </p>

          <p>With rising credit card interest rates, many Americans are considering bankruptcy as a debt relief solution, with personal bankruptcy inquiries on the rise. Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers a quick erasure of unsecured debts like credit card balances, but may require giving up non-exempt assets and impacts credit for up to 10 years. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a repayment plan over three to five years, allowing debtors to protect assets while repaying debts based on affordability, with any remaining eligible debt discharged afterward, but impacts credit for up to seven years. The article advises exploring alternatives like debt settlement, debt management plans, or debt consolidation loans before committing to bankruptcy. </p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration has finalized a trade deal, but is awaiting approval from the other country's prime minister and parliament. While Lutnick did not disclose the country involved, he clarified that the negotiations were separate from those with China, which are being handled by the Treasury Secretary. Lutnick's remarks followed the implementation of widespread tariff hikes, some of which have been paused, and come amidst concerns about market volatility and declining business confidence due to trade uncertainties.

          <p>A proposed peace plan by former U.S. President Donald Trump, which would recognize Russia's control over Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine, has been met with resistance from Ukrainian officials and analysts. While the plan suggests Ukraine may join the EU but not NATO, many Ukrainians reject the idea of ceding territory for peace. Experts in Ukraine argue that the country's military situation is more stable than Trump perceives, and that conceding territory would only lead to further demands from Russia. Despite some acknowledging the need for difficult decisions, there is a consensus that legally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory is unacceptable. </p>

          <p>Eighty years after their service, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, a predominantly Black, all-female unit, will receive the Congressional Gold Medal. Deployed to Europe during World War II, the "Six Triple Eight" tackled a backlog of 17 million undelivered mail pieces, significantly boosting morale for American soldiers. Despite their achievements, the unit received little recognition upon their return in 1946, and the recent restoration of their story on the Arlington National Cemetery website follows concerns about diversity efforts being erased. The medal ceremony marks a long-overdue acknowledgement of their groundbreaking service amidst the challenges of segregation and sexism. </p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) is reviewing its transgender policy after protests and concerns regarding the inclusion of transgender women in women's football. The current policy allows transgender women to participate if they meet reduced testosterone levels and pass a "match observation" to ensure player safety and fair competition. The FA now has the ability to remove or refuse a player's permission to play in the women's game, giving the governing body "ultimate discretion" over eligibility and it will be managed on a "case-by-case basis". The review follows concerns from MPs and reported team withdrawals due to transgender player injuries, though the FA maintains its rules are "in the right place". </p>

This action by the humanities endowment was taken after a review by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, and redirected its funding toward “the President’s priorities.” The Mellon Foundation funding will help preserve humanities programs, particularly in rural states without a robust base of private philanthropy, and will support book festivals, literary events, local history projects and historical sites. The money from the Mellon Foundation is a one-time infusion. </p>

          <p>Three officials terminated from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) are suing the Trump administration, arguing that the president lacks the authority to remove them. The lawsuit contends that the CPB is a private corporation, not a government agency, and that the terminations risk damaging the organization's mission and independence. The move follows Trump's expressed desire to cut funding to NPR and PBS, which receive a significant portion of their public funding through the CPB. The ousted officials, appointed in 2022, are seeking to block the terminations and protect the organization from alleged overreach. </p>
