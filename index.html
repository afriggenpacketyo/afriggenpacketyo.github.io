            <p>China has cautioned nations against accommodating the United States in trade discussions concerning President Donald Trump's tariffs. This warning follows reports that Washington intends to pressure governments into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson emphasized that appeasement and compromise would not earn respect, and China would firmly oppose any deals made at its expense, vowing to take resolute countermeasures if necessary, reflecting a hardening stance against U.S. trade tactics. This comes amidst ongoing trade talks between the US and various countries, including Japan and South Korea.</p>

            <p>A hearing in Texas is paving the way for Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart mass shooting, to plead guilty in state court and avoid the death penalty. Crusius, who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanics, is expected to receive a life sentence without parole under the proposed plea deal. The decision to forgo the death penalty was influenced by the wishes of a majority of the victims' relatives. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange Venezuelan deportees held in El Salvador for political prisoners detained in Venezuela. Bukele addressed his proposal to President Nicolás Maduro, listing several opposition figures, journalists, and activists imprisoned during Venezuela's electoral crackdown. The offer comes amid international scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of Venezuelans deported from the U.S., who are held in a "mega-prison." Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, referring to Bukele as a "neofascist."</p>

Germany's new leadership, with Friedrich Merz as Chancellor, aims to revive German leadership in the EU, working with France and Poland.

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the U.S. and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for the release of an equal number of political prisoners held by Venezuela. Bukele directed his proposal to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro via social media. Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, criticized Bukele's proposal, questioning the legality of imprisoning the Venezuelans and accusing them of crimes like "rape and murder", while maintaining that Venezuelan political prisoners are only jailed for opposing Maduro.</p>

The Yasukuni Shrine honors Japan's wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, along with millions of war dead. Cabinet ministers also sent offerings, while past visits by Japanese leaders have drawn criticism from China and South Korea.</p>

Under this scenario, the effective tariff rate would land in the 10%-to-20% range. The firm lays out adjustments investors can make in response to the new tariff-heavy environment, including structured notes and hedge funds in diversified portfolios (not investment advice).</p>

The jet, which was meant for China’s Xiamen Airlines, landed at Seattle’s Boeing Field. Trump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. In retaliation, China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties, analysts say.</p>
