Among the cargo were 1,500 tortillas, a preferred crumb-free bread substitute for astronauts in weightlessness. The Dragon spacecraft also brought an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the station's altitude, with re-boost operations planned to begin in September 2025.

          <p>Nvidia is preparing for its fiscal second-quarter earnings report, marking two years since generative AI began transforming its business, tripling revenue and quadrupling profits. The chipmaker recently achieved a $4 trillion market cap, driven largely by its data center revenue, which now accounts for 88% of total sales. Analysts anticipate a 53% year-over-year revenue jump to $45.9 billion, with strong performance from its Blackwell line expected to affirm its technological leadership. The company is also navigating U.S. export restrictions to China, impacting sales forecasts for its H20 chip.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to boost its struggling U.S. coffee division. Following the acquisition, expected in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies. This move would effectively unwind its 2018 merger, with the new coffee entity projected to generate $16 billion in annual sales. Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper fell 8% on the news, while JDE Peet's climbed 17%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent delays in student loan forgiveness, exacerbated by court actions and expiring tax protections, could result in substantial tax bills for hundreds of thousands of borrowers. The American Rescue Plan Act, which made federal student loan forgiveness tax-free, is set to expire at the end of 2025. Borrowers whose debt cancellation is delayed past this date may face federal taxes on the forgiven amount, with an average tax burden potentially exceeding $12,000 for those in higher brackets. Advocates urge the Education Department to expedite relief to prevent these financial penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S.-China Business Council report states that China's recent exit bans on two American businesspeople do not increase the overall travel risk for U.S.-based executives. The trade advocacy group concluded that these cases appear to follow existing enforcement patterns and are not indicative of broader geopolitical retaliation. While acknowledging that the high-profile incidents have prompted companies to review travel procedures, the report suggests that the general risk of exit bans or detentions for most travelers remains unchanged. This assessment aims to provide clarity amid ongoing U.S.-China tensions.</p>

          <p>Park rangers have removed an illegal marijuana cultivation site spanning approximately 13 acres in California’s Sequoia National Park, eradicating 2,377 full-grown plants. The operation also recovered 2,000 pounds of trash and infrastructure, including a semi-automatic pistol and hazardous chemicals like the banned insecticide Methamidophos. The site caused significant environmental damage, diverting water, clearing vegetation, and digging terraces. Despite marijuana legalization in California, strict regulations have fueled a black market, leading to widespread ecological harm in national parks and other areas.</p>
