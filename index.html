            <p>The death toll from severe flooding in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has risen to 33, with authorities struggling to assist hundreds of displaced families. Heavy rains caused the Ndjili River to overflow, submerging buildings and blocking access roads, leading to widespread destruction and hampering access to drinking water. Many residents have criticized the government's slow response, while officials cite collapsed walls as the primary cause of fatalities. This disaster compounds the existing humanitarian crisis in eastern Congo, further straining the country's resources.</p>

            <p>Birmingham, the U.K.'s second-largest city, is facing a sanitation crisis as a strike by garbage truck workers enters its fifth week, leading to massive piles of uncollected waste. The strike, triggered by job eliminations and pay cuts, has resulted in significant budget cuts due to the city council's effective bankruptcy following a settlement over historic pay discrimination. Residents are struggling with overflowing bins, illegal dumping, and limited waste disposal options, prompting the council to declare a major incident. The situation has drawn criticism and raised concerns about public health as temperatures rise.</p>

            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean advocates for an aggressive interest rate cut of at least 0.5% to 4% in May to counter the financial turmoil caused by President Trump's trade tariffs. Bean believes the uncertainty created by the tariffs will negatively impact business investment and consumer spending, necessitating a stronger response than currently anticipated by financial markets. Another former rate setter, David Blanchflower, suggests an emergency meeting to consider a deeper reduction in borrowing costs. The Office for Budget Responsibility previously forecasted that a similar global trade dispute would significantly reduce the UK's national income.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports could inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's actions, styled as America's “Liberation Day,” have triggered market instability and fears of a global recession, potentially prompting countries to unite against the U.S. This could bolster China's long-standing application to join the CPTPP, a trading bloc that includes several major economies. The CPTPP was formed after the U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership under Trump's initial administration.</p>

            <p>President Trump is standing firm on his tariff policies, despite widespread economic turmoil and warnings from economists. He has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the country does not rescind its retaliatory tariffs. Trump has defended his sweeping tariffs, saying "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something." Top officials in the administration have dismissed fears of a recession and reiterated that the tariff policy will be implemented as planned.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to continue using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport alleged gang members, but with certain limitations. The court ruled that any challenges to the wartime law must take place in Texas, where the migrants were held, and emphasized that judicial review is required. Despite siding with the administration, the court placed limits on how deportations may occur, ensuring that detainees receive notice and have the opportunity to seek habeas relief.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will begin direct, high-level talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting on Saturday. Trump offered few details about the upcoming talks, only saying the meeting will be at "almost the highest level." Netanyahu said he and Trump are united in the goal that Tehran will never get nuclear weapons. The meeting took place as new tariffs the president is levying on Israel and the rest of the world are about to go into effect.</p>

            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions instigated by US President Donald Trump, increased engagement between Europe and China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. Despite past turmoil and calls for de-risking, relations between Europe and China have strengthened, evidenced by softening tones from European leaders and increased diplomatic and business interactions. The reciprocal tariffs implemented by the US go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade, highlighting a shift where political strategy overrides economics.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and stellar opposing defense led to the Dodgers' 6-4 loss to the Nationals, highlighting a disconcerting early-season trend. Errors by key players cost the team runs, while the Nationals' defense prevented potential rallies. The Dodgers have committed seven errors in the last six games and yielded the most unearned runs in the majors. Despite Shohei Ohtani's strong performance at the plate, the team's struggles with fundamental baseball continue to be a source of frustration.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision in Trump v. J.G.G., overturning a lower court ruling that blocked President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport individuals without due process. While the Court does not express an opinion on whether the Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone, it rules that individuals must be given "notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal." This decision allows deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to resume, but it requires the government to provide due process.</p>

            <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro dismissed Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs on U.S. imports, arguing that it "means nothing" because the focus should be on non-tariff trade barriers. Navarro emphasized issues such as alleged cheating, intellectual property theft, and value-added taxes. He said that eliminating these policies would require major domestic changes in target countries. Navarro's comments suggest that the Trump administration is shifting its focus to broader trade issues beyond just tariffs.</p>

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market” amid investor panic. Chinese markets showed slight recovery after plunging on Monday.</p>
