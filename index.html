          <p>Alaska Airlines grounded all flights nationwide due to an IT outage affecting operations. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at the airline's request, leading to widespread travel disruptions. The airline apologized for the inconvenience and advised passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. This is the second IT outage affecting Alaska Airlines this year, with a similar incident occurring in July, halting flights for about three hours. The immediate impact on Seattle Tacoma International Airport was minimal, but the situation remained fluid as the airline worked to resolve the issue. The incident underscores the reliance of modern air travel on stable IT infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Former NFL referee Terry McAulay has criticized the Southeastern Conference (SEC) after reports that longtime official Ken Williamson was permanently suspended following questionable calls during a Georgia-Auburn game. McAulay defended Williamson, calling him a very good referee and pointing out that officials, like players and coaches, sometimes have bad games. He criticized the conference's oversight of officiating, suggesting it would create a dark stain on college football. The controversial calls in the Auburn-Georgia game prevented Auburn from taking a commanding lead, ultimately contributing to Georgia's victory. The SEC routinely evaluates officiating crews, but the impact of these evaluations on future assignments remains private. </p>

          <p>Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier were arrested in connection with major federal gambling investigations. Billups is accused of participating in a nationwide scheme to rig poker games with Mafia crime families, using high-tech cheating technology. Rozier is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering related to suspicious sports betting activity. Former NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested for allegedly leaking medical information about Los Angeles Lakers stars to sports bettors. The NBA has placed Billups and Rozier on immediate leave, emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations and the league's commitment to the integrity of the game. </p>

          <h2>Cowboy Builder Continued Fraud Despite Criminal History</h2>

          <p>Mark Killick, a prolific cowboy builder with a criminal record dating back to 1995, defrauded 37 victims of over £1.25 million. He legally changed his name twice and continued working in the building trade, exploiting the system's lack of regulation. Killick's victims were often misled by glowing online reviews and a professional website, failing to uncover his past convictions. Experts are calling for tighter rules on convicted fraudsters and increased regulation in the building trade to protect homeowners. The case highlights the need for a central register of convicted fraudsters to enable the public to identify rogue traders. </p>

          <p>A semi-truck driver arrested in connection with a deadly crash on a Southern California freeway was in the U.S. illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Jashanpreet Singh, an Indian national, entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in 2022, though California transportation officials stated that the federal government approved Singh's Employment Authorization Documents. The crash involved eight vehicles, resulting in three deaths and four injuries, and Singh has been charged with driving under the influence of drugs and gross vehicular manslaughter. The U.S. government had previously paused issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers to review screening protocols. The incident has reignited debate over immigration enforcement and commercial driver's license eligibility. </p>

          <p>Alabama executed Anthony Boyd using nitrogen gas, a controversial method of suffocation, after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his petition for a stay of execution. Boyd, convicted of murder, maintained his innocence until his final words, criticizing the justice system. This marks the eighth time nitrogen gas has been used for execution, following initial experimentation on Kenny Smith in January 2024. Opponents argue that nitrogen executions constitute cruel and unusual punishment, citing instances of prisoners writhing and convulsing during the procedure. Advocates claim it is a humane alternative to lethal injection, which has become difficult to administer due to drug shortages. </p>

The fire resulted in the destruction of over 6,800 structures and twelve deaths. Rinderknecht's defense maintains his innocence, questioning the connection between the two fires. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has informed the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud. President Donald Trump had called for Schiff's criminal prosecution, but experienced federal prosecutor Kelly Hayes believes the case is weak. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, stated that the politically-motivated allegations against the senator are baseless. Schiff himself has described the probe as an attempt to intimidate his political opponents. The DOJ has declined to comment on the report, leaving the investigation's future uncertain. </p>

          <p>A five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factories following a cyber-attack caused a significant decline in UK car production during September. JLR facilities produced no vehicles last month, leading to an overall 27% drop in UK car production. The cyber-attack is estimated to cost £1.9 billion and be the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history. JLR said production is returning in a phased approach, but the shutdown has raised concerns about the industry's competitiveness. The situation has prompted calls for government intervention to support domestic car production. </p>

          <p>Planned airport expansion in the UK could jeopardize the government's net-zero emissions targets, according to a committee of MPs. The report states that the government has not demonstrated that the economic benefits of expansion outweigh the negative climate impact.

The report raises concerns about the feasibility of meeting climate targets while expanding airport capacity.
