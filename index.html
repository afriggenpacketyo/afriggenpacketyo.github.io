          <p>A deadly U.S. military strike targeted a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, resulting in at least two survivors who are now in American custody. The operation is part of a broader military campaign intended to pressure Venezuelan President Maduro over his alleged role in orchestrating illicit drug trafficking. This incident occurs amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the region and the unexpected resignation of the admiral overseeing the operations, who reportedly had reservations about the strategy.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," focusing on a skilled female surgeon as the protagonist. She explains her motivation was to create a character whose value comes from her unique skills rather than her sex appeal, contrasting it with the bikini-clad women in James Bond films she watched growing up. Witherspoon, who has championed female-led stories through her production company Hello Sunshine, collaborated with author Harlan Coben on the novel.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to ask President Trump for long-range Tomahawk missiles, upgraded air defense systems, and enhanced intelligence sharing. The request aims to bolster Ukraine's ability to strike Russia's energy sector, a key source of Moscow's war funding, ahead of the winter months. The discussions also include potential joint manufacturing with U.S. defense firms, reflecting a more aggressive strategy by the Trump administration to increase economic and military pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of adopting "kingmaker" tactics in the ongoing government shutdown negotiations. Thune stated he is open to negotiating on expiring Obamacare subsidies, a key Democratic demand, but only after the government reopens, and refuses to strike a private deal with Schumer. He emphasized his preference for a bottom-up legislative process, contrasting it with what he describes as Schumer's centralized control, as the shutdown nears its fourth week.</p>

It highlights Trump's deployment of U.S. troops to Democrat-run cities, his rhetoric casting political opponents as an "enemy from within," and his use of the justice system against critics. The author suggests these actions are not for crime prevention but are politically motivated to intimidate opposition and could be setting the stage for a second American civil war.</p>

          <h2>Bodybuilders Shift from 'Dirty Bulking' to Healthier 'Lean Bulking' Methods</h2>

          <p>A cultural shift is underway in the bodybuilding community, with many enthusiasts moving away from "dirty bulking"—consuming massive amounts of processed, high-calorie foods—to "lean bulking." This newer approach involves a more moderate caloric surplus from healthy food sources to build muscle more sustainably and with less fat gain. The trend reflects a broader societal embrace of wellness, minimally processed foods, and a desire to maintain a chiseled physique year-round, though experts caution it can still lead to extreme dieting and body image disorders.</p>

          <p>European and Asian stock markets experienced significant declines, led by banking shares, after two U.S. regional banks reported exposure to bad loans and alleged fraud. The news sparked fears of wider credit stress, with investors drawing parallels to the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and questioning lending standards after a period of high interest rates. In response to the market volatility, jittery investors sought safe-haven assets, pushing the price of gold to a new record high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, but they fall significantly short of the president's campaign pledge to make the procedure free. The plan offers federal guidance for employers to provide optional fertility coverage and secures some drug discounts, but includes no new mandates or subsidies. The modest proposals have disappointed patients seeking cost relief, while also failing to appease some religious conservatives who object to IVF, illustrating the administration's attempt to navigate a politically sensitive issue.</p>

          <p>The data center capacity around Milan, Italy's financial hub, is projected to grow tenfold over the next five years, adding approximately two gigawatts of power consumption. This rapid expansion, driven by the demands of artificial intelligence, presents a significant revenue opportunity for local utilities like A2A, which will supply the necessary electricity. To meet this surge in demand without straining the local grid, new facilities will connect to the high-voltage grid, and authorities are supporting an increase in both renewable and thermal power generation.</p>
