          <p>Benjamin Elliott, a 17-year-old from Texas, was convicted of his twin sister Meghan's murder despite his defense team arguing he was sleepwalking. Benjamin claimed to have little memory of the event, describing it as a realistic nightmare, and called 911 after realizing he had stabbed her. Prosecutors challenged the sleepwalking defense, highlighting Benjamin's calm demeanor during interrogation and the two stab wounds Meghan sustained, arguing his actions were intentional. The jury found him guilty, and he received a 15-year prison sentence, which he is appealing, maintaining his innocence.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed comprehensive sanctions on Iran, including asset freezes and arms deal halts, using a 'snapback' mechanism from the 2015 nuclear deal. This action, triggered by France, Germany, and the UK, comes as Iran's economy is already struggling with a devalued currency and soaring food prices, leading to widespread public anxiety. Iran's increased uranium enrichment and restricted IAEA monitoring prompted the move, with Western powers urging de-escalation while Iran condemns the sanctions as 'unfair, unjust, and illegal.' The situation raises fears of renewed conflict and further domestic repression within the Islamic Republic.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off its entire stake in the company, expressing gratitude for 17 years of investment. BYD executives stated that buying and selling stocks is 'normal' for investors like Buffett, who reportedly made a 20-fold profit on his initial investment. The news, however, led to a more than 6% drop in BYD shares in Hong Kong, amidst concerns about cooling growth, reduced sales targets, and a recent quarterly profit decline. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway continues to expand its holdings in Japanese trading houses.</p>

          <p>Amber Smith, wife of former country star Granger Smith, shared harrowing details of her husband's near-suicide attempt in her forthcoming memoir, 'The Girl on the Bathroom Floor.' Following the tragic drowning of their 3-year-old son River in 2019, Granger, overwhelmed by grief and alcohol, put a gun to his mouth. Amber recounts his revelation years later about how close he was to pulling the trigger, before a spiritual intervention led him to cry out to Jesus and collapse. Granger, now a minister, and Amber have since become advocates for children's water safety, channeling their grief into purpose. (Maximum two Fox News articles)</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the return of Donald Trump to power could signal an end to ideology in US-China relations, moving towards a 'reverse convergence.' The author posits that the US may be adopting a more pragmatic approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace, similar to China's. This perspective challenges the long-held Western 'convergence theory,' which posited that societies would become more alike with industrialization. The article argues that such theories oversimplify social change and overlook unique cultural and historical contexts, hinting at a new, less ideologically driven dynamic.</p>

The scientists then developed a prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes shoes by killing the odor-causing bacteria, Kytococcus sedentarius.

The move follows deadly US navy strikes in the South Caribbean, which US officials describe as counter-narcotics operations, but Venezuela's defense minister labels an 'undeclared war.' While experts doubt a full-scale US invasion, the Trump administration's non-recognition of Maduro's re-election and designation of a Venezuelan gang as a terrorist group exacerbate the strained relationship.

The European team's dominant performance has left the US facing a monumental task, with their largest-ever pre-singles deficit. The match was also marred by aggressive and personal insults from American galleries towards European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to increased security. Despite the hostile environment, Europe's strategic play and resilience have positioned them for a historic away victory.</p>

          <p>An analysis delves into President Donald Trump's increasingly unfiltered rhetoric and his perceived invincibility, noting his recent controversial statements on topics ranging from autism to political opponents. The article highlights how Trump appears to embrace professional disapproval as a sign of authenticity, challenging conventional political norms. His combative address at the United Nations and seemingly inconsistent stances on international conflicts are presented as part of a strategy to dictate terms and frame himself as above normal consequences. This approach, the article suggests, cultivates an image of an 'untouchable' political figure.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure and the court's evolution in his forthcoming memoir, 'Life, Law, & Liberty.' Kennedy, often the 'swing justice,' discusses his decisive votes on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, noting that 'the cases swung, not me.' He expresses concern over the current era's confrontational discourse and the tone of some court opinions. The memoir also reveals personal reflections, including a reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia over a contentious dissent and his evolving views on juvenile death penalties and originalism.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office resulted in one death and two critical injuries among detainees. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, with evidence suggesting an anti-ICE motive, including engraved shell casings. The deceased detainee was identified as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, with Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina critically wounded; all three were described by DHS as 'criminal illegal aliens.' DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric, and ordered increased security at facilities nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate, with conflicting scientific evidence. Collagen, the body's most abundant protein, naturally declines with age, leading many to seek supplements in various forms. While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, dermatologists remain skeptical about whether orally ingested collagen peptides effectively reach and boost skin cells. Industry-funded studies often suggest positive effects, but independent research frequently finds no significant impact on skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles, emphasizing the importance of sun protection, diet, and avoiding smoking for skin health.</p>

          <p>Bali, Indonesia's renowned tropical paradise, is increasingly grappling with the negative consequences of overtourism, leading to environmental strain and visitor disillusionment. Social media's idealized portrayal often clashes with the reality of crowds, traffic, and rampant construction, exacerbated by a post-pandemic tourism boom. Recent severe floods, worsened by poor waste management and unchecked development, prompted local government to restrict new construction. While some locals lament the 'erosion' of the island's unique culture and natural beauty, others emphasize exploring beyond tourist hotspots and advocate for responsible travel and sustainable development efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of 'full force' if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump claimed the action would protect ICE facilities under siege from 'Antifa and other domestic terrorists,' a move met with strong pushback from Democratic lawmakers. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek called any deployment an 'abuse of power' and is coordinating with the state's attorney general to respond. The announcement marks an expansion of federal intervention amid ongoing tensions and a wider crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, shouting 'YOU'RE FIRED!' This action follows Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, despite a recent rate cut. While no US president has ever successfully fired a Fed chair, and the Supreme Court recently indicated the president lacks such authority, Trump's threats raise concerns about the central bank's independence. Economists and investors fear that removing Powell could lead to increased longer-term interest rates and compromise the Fed's dual mandate. (not investment advice)</p>
