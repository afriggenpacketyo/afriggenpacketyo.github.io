          <p>The United Kingdom is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day with a series of events spanning four days. Commemorations begin with quiet reflections at the Cenotaph in London, draped in Union Jack flags, honoring fallen soldiers of World War Two. The Red Arrows will perform a flypast, and the Royal Family will host a tea party for war veterans and their families at Buckingham Palace. Street parties are planned nationwide, and pubs in England and Wales will extend their hours, while the Tower of London will feature an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, remembering the lives lost during the war.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing trial in New York City on multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, spanning several decades. Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise involving sexual assault, forced labor, and obstruction of justice, allegations he denies. The trial includes disturbing accusations, including directing elaborate sexual performances called "Freak Offs" and physically assaulting women. A 2016 security video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura is expected to be a key piece of evidence. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, potentially leading to a life sentence if he is convicted on all counts.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, creating uncertainty for communities like Noatak, Alaska, which relies on diesel for heating and electricity. The Inupiat village had planned to expand its solar panel farm using these tax credits to reduce energy costs for residents, who face exorbitant electricity bills. However, Trump's efforts to defund the Inflation Reduction Act, coupled with hard-right Republicans' demands for repeal, have jeopardized these projects. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating for the tax credits, emphasizing their importance for long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is restarting student loan collections for millions of borrowers in default, even as the federal student loan system faces sweeping changes and disruptions. Many borrowers who had signed up for the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan are now caught in limbo due to GOP-led lawsuits, and some will have to switch to other plans that could increase their monthly payments. Borrowers also report long wait times to speak with Education Department staff, and the resumption of collections could negatively impact credit scores. Critics warn that restarting collections amid such uncertainty will exacerbate economic chaos for working families.</p>

Since the collapse of a cease-fire in March, Israel has blocked humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza and renewed its bombardment of the region.
