          <p>CBS has announced the conclusion of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, ending the program's run of over three decades. The network stated the cancellation is a purely financial decision amid challenges in late-night television and is not related to the show's content or performance. The announcement has sparked speculation, with some public figures questioning if it is politically motivated, particularly following a recent legal settlement between parent company Paramount and Donald Trump. Host Stephen Colbert confirmed the news to his audience, expressing gratitude to CBS and his viewers.</p>

          <p>MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party for a second time following an investigation into recent remarks she made about racism. In a BBC interview, she reiterated her controversial 2023 view that racism against people of color differs from prejudice experienced by Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers. Abbott stated it is "obvious" the Labour leadership wants her out of the party, a claim that comes amid internal party tensions over discipline. The suspension means she will sit as an independent MP pending the outcome of the new investigation.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, linking it to the deadly April attack in Pahalgam, India, which killed 26 people. U.S. officials described the TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-designated terrorist group. India has welcomed the decision, viewing it as a strong affirmation of U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation and a step toward justice for the victims. The designation imposes sanctions on the group and aims to disrupt its access to financial and material resources.</p>

          <p>The German government has resumed collective deportation flights to Afghanistan, sending 81 Afghan men with criminal records back to their home country. This is the first such flight under the new government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz, which has prioritized a tougher migration policy. The Interior Ministry stated the deportations are part of an agreement to remove criminals and individuals who pose a security threat. The move has been controversial, as Germany does not officially recognize the Taliban government, but Berlin has stated it held talks to facilitate the process.</p>

          <p>A recent ban by India's market regulator against U.S. trading firm Jane Street has intensified the debate over the distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation. India's SEBI accused the firm of a "deliberate strategy to manipulate indices" by using large stock trades to influence prices for its benefit in the options market. While Jane Street claims its actions were standard arbitrage, experts note the key distinction lies in intent and whether a firm creates artificial price dislocations. The case underscores the complexities of regulating high-frequency trading in modern financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of regions across Russia are experiencing widespread and unpredictable cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials claim are a necessary security measure to counter Ukrainian drone attacks. The disruptions have spread from border regions to Siberia and the Far East, affecting daily life by disabling electronic payments, ride-sharing apps, and navigation. Digital rights experts warn that while the shutdowns are publicly justified by security concerns, they represent an unprecedented level of control over the internet. This could legitimize further restrictions on already curtailed online freedoms in the country.</p>

          <h2>Brazilian President Lula Calls Trump's Tariff Threats 'Unacceptable Blackmail'</h2>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump linked the tariffs to the ongoing legal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula labeled the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty, calling Brazilian politicians who support Trump's stance "traitors." The dispute highlights a significant diplomatic feud, with Trump publicly supporting Bolsonaro and the Lula administration defending the independence of its judiciary.</p>

          <h2>A Personal Reflection on Turning 35 and the Realization That Adulthood is a Process of 'Winging It'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood notion that adults have everything figured out. The piece contemplates the journey of an immigrant, the feeling of being between two cultures, and the process of accepting that life is a constant state of becoming, rather than a destination. Using the French TV show "Bref" as a cultural touchstone, the author explores themes of regret, relationships, and finding meaning in a chaotic world. The reflection concludes that while answers are scarce, the goal is to remain open and build a meaningful life.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by building and successfully operating his own seven-meter-long submarine. Zhang, a lifelong riverside resident fascinated by invention, was inspired by a television program in 2014 to build a vessel that could travel underwater. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly bought steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the submarine. His creation, which he has been seen piloting on a local river, is the fulfillment of a long-held dream to build machines beyond the means of his rural life.</p>

          <p>A report from a Beijing-based think tank has revealed a decline in China's overall marketisation index, prompting calls from economists for more pro-market reforms. The index, which measures factors like the relationship between the government and the market, fell in 2023 from its peak in 2021, with the largest drop seen in the subindex tracking government intervention. Experts are urging action to reverse this trend to tackle economic imbalances and what they describe as vicious intra-industry competition. The findings suggest a recent shift away from market-led resource allocation in the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal narrative, a man recounts his harrowing journey with Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare and aggressive cancer that he initially mistook for jock itch. After more than a year of failed treatments, a biopsy finally revealed the diagnosis, leading to multiple extensive surgeries and a painful recovery. The author highlights the challenges of diagnosing a rare disease and the isolation that follows. He has since founded the largest online resource and support group for EMPD to raise awareness and ensure others do not face the disease alone.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and matching economists' expectations. The easing was partly due to a slight moderation in the rapid rise of rice prices, though inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of U.S. tariffs could re-ignite price pressures. The economic outlook is further complicated by political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis piece questions the official explanation that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is ending for purely financial reasons, suggesting a pattern of capitulation to President Donald Trump by parent company Paramount. The article highlights the show's strong ratings and contrasts the decision with recent actions, such as settling a lawsuit from Trump and the departure of the "60 Minutes" chief. It posits that sacrificing the program, hosted by a prominent Trump critic, may be a strategic move to ensure federal approval for Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged on his program that he had made a mistake in a report that accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of lying about a phone call with President Trump. The acknowledgment follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who claimed Watters and Fox News distorted the timeline of his conversation with Trump. In a tongue-in-cheek segment, Watters stated he misunderstood Newsom's social media post and said the governor "wasn't lying. He was just confusing and unclear." Newsom's office indicated the lawsuit will proceed despite the on-air remarks.</p>
