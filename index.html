          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has not endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a need for further discussion on Mamdani's vision. While Jeffries praised the campaign's focus on affordability and organizational success, he expressed concerns over Mamdani's past rhetoric, particularly regarding Israel and antisemitism. Jeffries stated that the self-proclaimed democratic socialist will need to clarify his positions to gain the confidence of the communities he represents.

Contentious provisions include raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and lifting the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

          <p>A new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America" by Sam Tanenhaus, explores the origins of the modern conservative movement through its intellectual leader, William F. Buckley, Jr. An excerpt from the book details his upbringing, heavily influenced by his father, a wealthy oil speculator, and his family's deep Catholic faith. It describes the family's grand estate in Sharon, Connecticut, named Great Elm, where the young Buckley was one of ten children. This environment shaped the future founder of the National Review and host of "Firing Line," who saw himself as an heir to a legacy rather than a founder.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States must stop viewing rare earth metals as simple commodities and start treating them as instruments of geopolitical power, similar to China's approach. The author contends that China's recent export controls on these critical minerals, essential for modern technology and defense, expose a dangerous American vulnerability. Despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to build secure, independent supply chains, leaving it exposed to Beijing's economic leverage. The article calls for a long-term national strategy involving domestic investment, permitting reform, and stronger alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill following a threatened rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had to shift its approach after substantial concerns were raised about planned cuts to benefits like the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Key concessions include limiting PIP cuts to new claimants and allowing the health-related component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, likely ensuring the bill's passage.</p>

Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon, finding that approximately 17% had incorrect levels of active ingredients. Such defects can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for cancer patients. The problem is attributed to manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by inadequate regulatory systems and a lack of screening technologies in the affected regions.</p>

The film, the first from the new DC Studios, seeks to honor the legacy of Christopher Reeve's portrayal while offering a fresh perspective.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is warning Americans about a "brushing" scam where individuals receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items. This scheme is used by third-party online sellers who have obtained personal information to create fake transactions and post fraudulent "verified" reviews in the recipient's name. While receiving a free item may seem harmless, it indicates a potential data breach that could lead to identity theft or financial fraud. The USPS advises reporting such incidents, checking financial accounts for unusual activity, and updating passwords to protect personal information.</p>

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reflects on his journey as an immigrant who fled Iran and his leadership at the transportation giant. Since taking over in 2017, he has worked to reform the company's once-toxic culture and navigate challenges, including driver compensation and the rise of autonomous vehicles. Khosrowshahi acknowledges that ride prices have increased due to inflation and the need for competitive driver pay, and he expresses concern over the wide gap in compensation between executives and the middle class.

Grossi expressed uncertainty about the current location of Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpile and stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify activities.

This approach, which focuses on collaboration rather than mandates, is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the goal is to make healthy options more accessible and relieve pressure on the national health service.</p>

They are also highly adept at connecting their personal experiences with sexuality to broader political issues, such as reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ advocacy. This shift is happening against a backdrop of rising sexual conservatism, creating a defining cultural and political battle for the generation.</p>

In a startup environment, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, get into the details to devise a solution, and personally see it through.

Despite economic uncertainty, the report notes persistent progress in savings behaviors, partly driven by plan design features like automatic enrollment.
