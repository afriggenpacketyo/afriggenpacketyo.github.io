          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk is intensifying its direct-to-consumer sales strategy for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, in response to competition from copycat compounders and pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. The company's online platform allows patients to buy the drug for significantly less than its list price, a move aimed at regaining market share. Despite this, Novo Nordisk's sales forecasts have been weakened by the prevalence of "unsafe and unlawful" compounded drugs, prompting the company to revise its annual growth expectations.

The company's direct-to-consumer streaming business saw continued subscriber growth, adding 1.8 million to Disney+, and is expected to generate significant operating income. While the experiences segment, including parks and cruises, saw an 8% revenue increase, the traditional linear TV business continued to decline, and the theatrical unit suffered from poor box office results compared to the previous year.

          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democratic legislators to block a Republican redistricting plan is part of a long history of such tactics in the state, dating back to 1870. This article details previous instances where lawmakers fled the state to break quorum and halt legislative action, including a notable 38-day walkout in 2021 over a restrictive voting bill. Past walkouts, such as those in 2003 against another redistricting effort and in 1979 to block a primary date change, have had mixed success. While legislators have faced threats of arrest, few have faced significant consequences upon their return.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a poster for BrewDog's Wingman beer, ruling that it irresponsibly implied alcohol could solve problems like boredom, loneliness, or frustration. The ad featured text describing frustrating scenarios like a friend being late and positioned the beer as a reliable "Wingman" that "always got your back." While BrewDog argued the ad was about reliable quality, the ASA concluded it breached the code by suggesting alcohol could overcome personal problems. This is not the first time the company's advertising has been censured by the watchdog.</p>

          <p>A WNBA game between the Indiana Fever and the Los Angeles Sparks was briefly interrupted when a sex toy was thrown onto the court from the stands. The object landed near Fever forward Sophie Cunningham, who had previously criticized such acts. This is the latest in a series of similar incidents at WNBA games in cities like Atlanta and Chicago. The league has condemned the behavior as dangerous and disrespectful, stating that any fan caught throwing objects onto the court will be ejected and face a minimum one-year ban.</p>

          <p>Police in Argentina have arrested a 37-year-old man suspected of being a serial killer who targeted and dismembered homeless people. The suspect, known locally as the "machete man," allegedly lured at least five victims to his home, where he would murder them. A raid on his residence uncovered human remains, including bones, skin, and a nose. The investigation began after security footage linked several missing persons to the same individual, leading police to the suspect's house where his nephew provided a horrifying account of the murders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being economically and politically unpopular, President Trump's tariffs on foreign imports may be difficult for future administrations to repeal. The tariffs are generating substantial revenue for the U.S. government, projected at $2.2 trillion over the next decade, effectively acting as a major tax hike without congressional approval. With rising deficits and a political aversion to other forms of taxation, future presidents may be reluctant to eliminate this revenue stream. This creates a scenario where a flawed policy could be sustained by fiscal necessity and political convenience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by Donald Trump, has been inaugurated as the new president of Poland, potentially shifting the country toward a more nationalist direction. While day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president holds veto power and influences foreign policy. Nawrocki, who won a narrow election in June, has vowed to support Poland's role in NATO and the EU but has stated he will resist any transfer of competencies away from Poland. His rise raises questions about the future of the centrist government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that football clubs in crisis, such as Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe, can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. Her comments come as a new law establishing an independent football regulator is set to be implemented, granting it powers to oversee clubs in England's top five divisions. Nandy emphasized that the regulator will introduce stronger tests for owners and could even force sales in dire circumstances. She stressed the importance of these clubs to their communities and vowed to prevent collapses like that of Bury FC in 2019.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a significant "confidence gap" among families paying for college, with many feeling prepared until the actual tuition bills arrive. While 59% of parents felt confident about managing expenses upon their child's acceptance, only 21% felt the same once costs were finalized. With college costs rising much faster than inflation, families are relying on a mix of savings, income, and loans. However, many are not fully utilizing key financial tools like the FAFSA for federal aid or 529 savings plans, often leaving available financial support on the table.</p>

          <p>A new term, "AI vegans," has emerged to describe individuals who choose to abstain from using artificial intelligence for ethical, environmental, and personal wellness reasons. This movement draws parallels with dietary veganism, questioning the unseen costs of AI, such as its large environmental footprint and reliance on the labor of underpaid creatives. While a complete digital boycott may be unrealistic for most, the concept encourages greater awareness of how much AI we consume. The article suggests that understanding the "digital calorie count" of AI queries could help users make more conscious technology choices.</p>

          <p>Florida has opened a new immigration detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," which critics are calling an exercise in performative punishment. The 900-plus detainee facility, funded by the state and run by its emergency-management agency, houses immigrants in large plastic tents with no running water and questionable conditions. Attorneys have reported lack of access to clients, and concerns have been raised about safety during hurricane season. The facility is part of a broader, aggressive immigration enforcement strategy by the Trump administration and Florida's state government, but it is facing backlash even from some Republican voters in Miami.</p>

While parents will still be responsible for other costs like meals, Beijing hopes the measure will help address demographic challenges.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to "fight fire with fire" if Texas Republicans proceed with a plan to gerrymander their congressional maps. Newsom proposed a potential ballot measure that would ask California voters to approve a conditional, retaliatory gerrymander of their own state's maps to counteract any gains Republicans make in Texas. This controversial plan would require overriding California's current independent redistricting commission. The move sets up a high-stakes political battle, forcing voters to weigh the preservation of nonpartisan norms against the perceived need to combat partisan tactics from other states.</p>
