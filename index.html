          <p>In an exclusive BBC interview, Prince Harry shared his feelings about the recent court judgment regarding his security in the UK, expressing disappointment but a willingness to address concerns.

The Duke of Sussex also voiced his desire for reconciliation with his family, stating he can't envision a future where his wife and children visit the UK without adequate security. Prince Harry's remarks underscore the ongoing tensions and complexities surrounding his relationship with the royal family and his life after stepping down from royal duties.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes, offering potential for a universal antivenom. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's antibodies target common elements in toxins, and this article from the BBC details how researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies effective against neurotoxins, creating a cocktail that saved mice from fatal venom doses, marking a significant step toward a universal snakebite therapy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to eliminate the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods from mainland China and Hong Kong is expected to significantly impact online retailers like Temu and Shein. This move, which subjects these companies to tariffs as high as 145 percent, is already causing them to scale back their aggressive online advertising campaigns, which had been a boon for tech giants like Meta and Alphabet. This New York Times article explores how the change is affecting these companies' advertising strategies and the broader implications for the e-commerce landscape.</p>
