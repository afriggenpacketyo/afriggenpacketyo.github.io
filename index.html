          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has condemned Farmington Board of Education Chairman Bill Beckert for an alleged social media post that appeared to celebrate the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The GOP shared a screenshot showing Beckert's account reposting a comment that read, "They Reap What They Sow." Republican Chairman Ben Proto described the action as a grotesque endorsement of political violence, questioning if this is the example the community wants for its children. This incident is part of a broader pattern of controversial reactions to Kirk's death from public figures.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated that dozens of political prisoners released as part of a U.S.-brokered deal were forcibly deported from the country to Lithuania. While celebrating their freedom, she emphasized that the act was not a true release but an exile, separating them from their families without passports. The agreement, which saw sanctions lifted on Belarus's national airline, is viewed as a potential sign of improving U.S.-Belarus relations amid efforts to mediate the war in Ukraine. However, critics note many of the exiled prisoners were already nearing the end of their sentences.</p>

She vowed to ensure his name is never forgotten and that his work through Turning Point USA would continue with even greater force. Fighting back tears, she thanked supporters, first responders, and political figures like President Trump for their support. She also shared a poignant story about explaining her husband's absence to their three-year-old daughter, framing his death as being on a "work trip with Jesus."</p>

Crawford, undefeated, has moved up two weight classes to challenge the undisputed champion Álvarez, raising questions about whether his speed and power will translate to the heavier division. The fight is a classic clash of styles, pitting Álvarez's orthodox power and ring control against Crawford's mobility and tactical intelligence. Both fighters, in the later stages of their careers, are aiming to cement their historical standing in the sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Missouri state legislature has passed a new congressional map, backed by President Trump, which is expected to create an additional Republican-leaning House seat. The plan redraws districts to split the Kansas City area, making the district of longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver significantly more conservative and shifting the state's delegation to a 7-1 Republican majority. Critics, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have labeled the move a "rigged" mid-decade gerrymandering scheme. A lawsuit was immediately filed by the ACLU of Missouri, arguing the new map is unconstitutional and racially divisive.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard study reveals a strong link between experiences of violence and cardiovascular disease in women. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses for two decades, found that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk of heart disease. The risk was even greater, at 70% higher, for women who had obtained a restraining order against someone. Researchers concluded that these common traumatic experiences should be considered alongside traditional risk factors like diet and exercise when screening for heart health, aiming to improve preventative care for women.</p>

          <p>As astronomical autumn begins on September 22, stargazers can look forward to several notable celestial events during the longer nights. On September 21, Saturn will be in opposition, making it appear at its largest and brightest for the year and visible to the naked eye. Later, the Orionid meteor shower, which originates from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22. Viewing conditions for the Orionids are expected to be ideal, as the peak coincides with a new moon, minimizing light pollution and allowing for clearer observation of the fast-moving meteors.</p>

Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns of the Kloster Goldenstein convent, said they were never consulted about the move and felt homesick. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their lifelong home, where they had been granted right of residence.

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing, artificial intelligence tools significantly amplified the spread of false information across social media. A CBS News analysis found that X's AI chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect before an official announcement and generated altered images of the person of interest. Other AI systems, including Google's AI Overview and Perplexity, also produced inaccurate information, such as labeling the shooting a "hypothetical scenario." Experts warn that users tend to perceive AI as less biased than human sources, making the rapid dissemination of AI-generated falsehoods particularly dangerous during breaking news events.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the 2024 election shows that Donald Trump's improved performance with younger voters was crucial to his victory, a shift significantly influenced by the outreach of activists like Charlie Kirk. Through his Turning Point USA organization, Kirk successfully mobilized young men and persuaded the GOP to invest in youth-focused strategies, including using platforms like TikTok. According to exit polling, Trump performed better with voters under 30 than any Republican presidential candidate since 2004, effectively narrowing a margin that Democrats have historically dominated and helping to flip key swing states.</p>

The targeted partnerships include programs at institutions like New York University, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Minnesota. The report escalates a campaign to curb academic collaborations over concerns they could aid Beijing's military and technological ambitions. A partnership is deemed high-risk if it has links to China's defense sector, military-focused entities, or intelligence end-uses, according to the committees.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to end humanitarian parole protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision lifts a lower court's stay, allowing the administration to terminate the Biden-era policies that had provided a two-year legal pathway and work authorization for these individuals. The administration argued the protections were always meant to be temporary and that it has the discretion to revoke them. Immigrant advocates expressed deep disappointment, stating the ruling cruelly reneges on the government's promises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging widespread discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims that Uber drivers routinely deny service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for animal shedding, and refuse to accommodate mobility devices. According to the Justice Department, these actions have caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination and has policies and a dedicated hotline in place to address violations, though it disagrees with the lawsuit's allegations.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and permit denser, taller residential buildings near major transit corridors. The bill allows for buildings up to nine stories high adjacent to transit stops, including in areas previously zoned for single-family homes. Proponents, like author Sen. Scott Wiener, argue the measure is a necessary step to address the state's severe housing shortage. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local control over responsible community growth.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Rush to Label Charlie Kirk a Martyr Overlooks His Divisive Rhetoric</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 18:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the immediate rush by many on the right to label Charlie Kirk a Christian martyr following his assassination. The author contrasts the traditional evangelical emphasis on empathy with Kirk's public disdain for the concept and his history of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric against various minority groups. The piece questions whether Kirk, who often listened without hearing and refused to change his perspective, fits the mold of a martyr. It concludes by suggesting that true martyrdom depends on what it means to be an evangelical Christian, an answer the author finds increasingly uncertain.</p>
