          <p>As the Democratic Party seeks to regain support, some members in California are proposing a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians, sparking debate about ageism and experience. The resolution, initiated by San Francisco Democrats, reflects concerns over leaders holding onto power past their prime, referencing instances like Senator Dianne Feinstein's declining health. While some argue that age limits are discriminatory and disregard the wisdom of experienced leaders like Senator Bernie Sanders, others believe it's necessary to make way for younger candidates. The article notes that the proposal faces significant hurdles, including potential legal challenges and resistance from current officeholders.</p>

          <p>The Daniel K. Inouye Telescope in Hawaii has achieved a milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this powerful tool will enhance their ability to predict solar storms, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) emphasized that the image was taken during technical testing, highlighting the VTF's potential. Researchers expressed optimism that the telescope will provide valuable insights into solar physics and help mitigate the damage caused by geomagnetic disturbances.</p>

          <p>Oakdale, California, a town with a classic American West identity, has seen a significant shift in its media consumption habits, with residents abandoning traditional outlets for online sources. The decline of local newspapers and the rise of social media have led to a fragmented information landscape, where residents often struggle to discern trustworthy news. The town's experience with misinformation, culminating in an armed militia storming the town in 2020, has further eroded trust in traditional media. Now, residents rely on Facebook groups and online influencers, creating a post-journalism environment marked by skepticism and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is issuing call-up notices to thousands of reservists to support an expanded offensive in Gaza, according to Israeli media reports. The reservists will be deployed to the border with Lebanon and in the occupied West Bank, replacing regular soldiers who will lead the new offensive in Gaza. This comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed his visit to Azerbaijan, citing developments in Gaza and Syria. The fragile ceasefire with Hamas was broken in March, leading to intensified bombing and buffer zones in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist discusses the complexities of antidepressant use, highlighting both the transformative benefits and the less advertised side effects such as sexual dysfunction and withdrawal symptoms. The article addresses the controversy surrounding Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's comparison of antidepressant withdrawal to heroin withdrawal, acknowledging the medical community's alarm while recognizing that some patients feel validated by his comments. The lack of high-quality research on safely tapering patients off antidepressants is noted, and the article advocates for a more nuanced discussion of the benefits and trade-offs of these medications, warning against both alarmism and dismissal of patient concerns.</p>

The BfV designated the AfD as a "confirmed rightwing extremist" force, citing its xenophobic stances and incompatibility with Germany's democratic order.

          <p>Mali's military junta intends to extend its rule until 2030 without democratic elections, prompting condemnation from the opposition. General Assimi Goita, the interim president, has secured support to be declared president until 2030, while a "national conference" proposed limiting the number of political parties and tightening conditions for founding new parties. Amnesty International has criticized the move as a flagrant attack on freedom of expression and association.

The airline has long advocated for Newark to be classified as a "Level 3" airport to limit scheduled flights.
