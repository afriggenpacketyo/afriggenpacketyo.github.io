        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent World Bank report indicates that Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in a decade, primarily driven by the oil and gas sector recovery and tech and finance industry expansion. Despite this growth, poverty levels remain high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty, making it the country with the second-largest poor population after India. The report also highlights the negative impact of insecurity in the Middle Belt region on the agriculture sector, contributing to slow growth and exacerbating inflation, which is expected to remain above 20% throughout the year. President Bola Tinubu's government reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, have been praised but have also led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians.</p>

          <p>Douglas "Pete" Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot and POW in the "Hanoi Hilton," reflects on his journey from prisoner of war to the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam after the war. Captured in 1966, Peterson spent six and a half years in captivity, enduring brutal interrogations. Upon his return to the United States, he made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind and contribute to positive change, which led to his appointment as ambassador by President Bill Clinton in 1997. Peterson credits his open and transparent approach for helping to forge a new diplomatic relationship, overseeing a key trade agreement and initiating the "Safe Vietnam" program to improve safety awareness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical shortage of air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic led to significant flight delays, with some flights held up for up to seven hours. The FAA acknowledged the staffing issues, stating that at least three controllers were scheduled each hour, but sources indicated that the number of fully certified controllers on duty was sometimes as low as one or two, while the target for that period is 14 controllers. The situation is further complicated by recent radar outages caused by software and hardware problems, runway construction, and the relocation of the air traffic management team from Long Island to Philadelphia, which angered some controllers and slowed down the training process. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce the number of flights at the airport to mitigate delays and has requested an investigation into the relocation to Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the complexities of determining who should be prescribed GLP-1 drugs, highlighting that changes in health, rather than weight alone, should be the primary goal. It emphasizes that visceral fat, which accumulates around the waist and organs, is more dangerous to health than subcutaneous fat. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat and improving metabolic health, making them most beneficial for individuals with excess visceral fat and related health consequences. The article also critiques the use of BMI as the primary metric for judging and distributing anti-obesity drugs, advocating for more accurate measures of visceral fat and insulin resistance.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington. The Department of Transportation confirmed that the Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted for a new engineering contract, with the goal of finding ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently. This move raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's leadership roles in multiple companies and his advisory position to President Trump, particularly as he oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut resources at federal agencies that regulate his businesses. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel is intended to replace the 152-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, but its estimated cost has increased to $8.5 billion, prompting the search for cost-saving measures.</p>

The victim was last seen walking around Sunnyvale with her 17-year-old boyfriend, who left her at a bus stop around midnight, according to prosecutors. The case was solved in 2019 when Sunnyvale police used a tip to determine that one of four Fresno brothers might have committed the crime and began a genealogical hunt to match the crime scene DNA to a family member.</p>

Alexander, who served in the Israeli military, was abducted during the Hamas-orchestrated attack on October 7, 2023.

          <h2>Trump Aims to Lower Drug Prices by Matching Other Nations' Rates</h2>

          <p>President Trump is pushing for drugmakers to lower their prices to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening to impose steep caps on Medicare earnings if they do not comply. He stated that the United States will no longer subsidize the healthcare of foreign countries and that some drug prices will be reduced by 50% to 90% almost immediately. This move expands on his previous "most favored nation" idea, aiming to pay the lowest price in the world for prescription drugs. The drug industry opposes this plan, arguing it would stifle innovation and investment in the U.S., while pharmacy benefit managers support efforts to lower drug prices.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal church's migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing its commitment to racial justice and reconciliation. Bishop Sean Rowe announced that the church will halt its partnership with the government, arguing that the South Africans are receiving preferential treatment over other refugees who have been waiting for years. Donald Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination. The South African government has denied these allegations. Other faith-based refugee agencies, like Church World Service, are open to serving the South African arrivals while expressing concern about the fast-tracking of their admission.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but the data was obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and published publicly. The report found that while the U.S. has made progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is not on track to meet its climate goals. In 2023, gross greenhouse gas emissions dropped about 17% since 2005, but a 61-66% reduction is needed by 2035. The transportation sector remains the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, and concerns exist that the Trump administration's policies may hinder further progress in reducing emissions.</p>

The Long Beach Unified School District is urging parents to discuss the dangers of participating in social media challenges with their children, emphasizing that such actions can lead to disciplinary action and legal consequences.

This incident highlights broader concerns about potential conflicts of interest, including his family's business dealings with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, and his family's ventures into cryptocurrency.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled their plans for a comprehensive tax bill that would temporarily enact President Trump's campaign pledges, including not taxing tips or overtime pay, while also rolling back subsidies for clean energy and creating a new tax-advantaged investment account for children. The bill aims to extend several provisions from Trump's 2017 tax law but faces criticism from some Republicans over the proposed limit on the state and local tax deduction. To offset the costs of the tax cuts, Republicans plan to raise taxes on certain sectors, including those related to President Biden's clean energy agenda and university endowments, and impose a new tax on remittances sent overseas. The legislation is expected to add at least $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.</p>

The US team, working on the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota, is constructing vast underground caverns to shield their detectors from external noise and radiation. The goal is to observe slight changes in these particles as they travel, potentially revealing why matter and antimatter did not cancel each other out after the Big Bang. Meanwhile, Japanese scientists are constructing Hyper K, an enhanced version of their existing neutrino detector, aiming to be operational sooner and potentially make a groundbreaking discovery about the origin of the Universe.</p>
