          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that aimed to remove approximately $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million Americans. The court found the CFPB overstepped its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This decision reverses a significant consumer protection measure, leaving many individuals to continue facing the negative credit impacts of medical debt, which the CFPB had argued is a poor predictor of overall creditworthiness. The rule had not yet gone into effect.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Senator Cory Booker sharply criticized former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, calling his actions regarding the "Signalgate" incident a "profound cowardice" and a "failure of leadership." Waltz, nominated to be the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., faced questions about a Signal group chat where sensitive information about military strikes was allegedly shared with a journalist. Booker refused to ask questions and stated he would not support the nomination, accusing Waltz of deflecting responsibility for the security lapse.</p>

          <p>John Torode, a long-time presenter of the BBC's "MasterChef," has been dismissed after an internal investigation upheld an allegation that he used "an extremely offensive racist term." This follows the recent firing of his co-host, Gregg Wallace, amid separate allegations, plunging the popular cooking show into crisis. In a statement, Torode said he had no memory of the alleged incident but agreed that such language is unacceptable. The BBC confirmed his contract will not be renewed, underscoring its zero-tolerance policy on racist language.</p>

          <p>In an unsigned emergency ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to dismantle the Department of Education. The decision, which offered no written explanation, lifts a lower court's block on the administration's mass layoffs and closure of the agency. The case was brought by states and unions arguing the president lacks the unilateral authority to abolish a department created by Congress. The court's three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sotomayor writing that the decision poses a "grave" threat to the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts to U.S. foreign aid under the Trump administration are creating a funding crisis for humanitarian and development projects across the Middle East. Civil society organizations in countries like Syria and Iraq report uncertainty and the potential collapse of essential programs. With the U.S. and other Western nations reducing their contributions, analysis suggests that wealthy Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE may become more significant donors. However, this could shift aid from being based on humanitarian principles to being a more transactional tool of foreign policy.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the UK government has released data detailing the immigration status of individuals receiving universal credit, a key social welfare benefit. The figures show that in June, 83.6% of the nearly eight million claimants were British and Irish nationals. The remaining 16.4% included over a million non-UK born individuals, the majority of whom are EU citizens with the right to live and work in the UK from before Brexit. The publication follows pressure from Conservative politicians who argue the figures demonstrate a need to tighten welfare eligibility for foreign nationals.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that the Justice Department's federal programs branch, tasked with defending Trump administration policies in court, has seen a massive exodus of personnel. Since President Trump's election, nearly two-thirds of the unit's lawyers, or 69 out of approximately 110, have voluntarily left. Former lawyers from the unit cited demoralization, a punishing workload, and ethical concerns about defending policies they felt were not legally justifiable as reasons for the departures.
