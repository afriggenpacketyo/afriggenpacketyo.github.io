          <p>Japan has executed Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of murdering nine people in 2017 after luring them through social media. The execution, carried out by hanging, is the country's first since July 2022. The case of the so-called "Twitter killer" has drawn significant attention and arrives amid a renewed national debate on capital punishment. This debate has been intensified by the recent exoneration of another man who spent over 40 years on death row, though public support for the death penalty in Japan remains high.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The rally was primarily fueled by easing investor concerns over steep US tariffs on China and diminishing tensions in the Middle East. The market was particularly encouraged by the White House's indication that it might extend a pause on new tariffs. Despite the strong performance, some analysts caution that the gains may not reflect stable economic fundamentals and that the market remains on unstable footing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new rule from the Trump administration will eliminate the 30-day warning period that was previously given before fining individuals residing in the U.S. illegally.

          <p>Manager Ruud van Nistelrooy has left Leicester City by mutual agreement, more than nine weeks after the club's relegation from the Premier League. The former Dutch striker's tenure was brief and challenging, with the team securing just five wins in 27 matches under his leadership.

          <p>A study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis, has found that illegal disposable vapes may pose a greater health risk than traditional cigarettes. The research revealed that popular, non-FDA-authorized e-cigarettes contain hazardous levels of toxic heavy metals, such as lead and nickel, which are known carcinogens. In some tested devices, the concentration of these metals was so high that it presented a significant cancer risk, with one brand exposing users to as much lead as smoking 19 packs of cigarettes.</p>

While the Trump administration previously advocated for privatization, the current focus appears to be on a multibillion-dollar investment to modernize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The article explores the arguments for and against removing air traffic control from direct government oversight, examining Canada's privatized model as an example while noting concerns that such a system would be ill-suited for America's complex airspace.</p>

The metaphor refers to the EU's perception that China is introducing retaliatory measures, such as tariffs on EU brandy, and then expecting to be paid to remove them. These punitive actions from Beijing are seen as a response to the EU's own duties on Chinese electric vehicles, creating a cycle of trade punishments that has stalled progress in diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's car production plummeted in May to its lowest level for that month since 1949, excluding the pandemic period. The nearly one-third drop from the previous year is largely attributed to the impact of US tariffs, which halved exports to the American market and forced some manufacturers to halt shipments. The industry's trade group expressed some optimism for future recovery, citing a recent agreement to reduce the tariffs and other government strategies aimed at supporting the sector. The disruption also stems from factories retooling for electric vehicle production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO has launched a new commercial space strategy to better integrate private sector innovations as its members increase their defense spending. With space now officially recognized as an operational domain alongside air, land, and sea, the alliance is focused on enhancing its capabilities in communication, navigation, and surveillance. This initiative includes forming partnerships with satellite and intelligence companies, reflecting a broader trend among Western nations to develop robust, secure space infrastructure for defense and security purposes.

          <p>A new trade framework has been finalized between the United States and China, aiming to de-escalate recent tensions.

In return, Washington has committed to lifting some of its restrictive countermeasures against Beijing, according to statements from both governments. This development marks a significant step toward implementing a broader consensus reached in earlier talks, though the path to a comprehensive deal remains long. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column analyzes a heated exchange between Supreme Court Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Neil Gorsuch, arguing it reveals a deep philosophical divide on the Court. The author criticizes Justice Jackson's dissenting view, which advocates looking beyond a law's literal text to determine congressional intent, as an overreach of judicial power. The piece contends that this approach improperly tasks judges with legislative responsibilities and that it should be Congress's duty to clarify any ambiguous statutes, not the Court's.</p>

          <p>This profile examines the legacy of Anna Wintour, who is stepping back from her day-to-day role as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly four decades. The article reflects on her unparalleled influence on global fashion, her business acumen in transforming the Met Gala into a major cultural event, and her often-controversial and demanding leadership style, famously fictionalized in "The Devil Wears Prada."

          <p>The Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government have signed an agreement to establish a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's senior leadership for the "crime of aggression." This new legal body, likely to be based in The Hague, is designed to close a jurisdictional gap, as the International Criminal Court cannot currently prosecute Russian officials for the act of waging war itself. While it is highly unlikely that defendants like Vladimir Putin will appear in person, the tribunal is seen as a crucial mechanism for gathering evidence and establishing legal accountability.</p>
