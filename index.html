          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to visit China to discuss several key issues, including the controversial ownership of the Port of Darwin. The visit, planned around mid-July, aims to maintain positive diplomatic relations while addressing Australia's stance on foreign investment and national security. The potential government-influenced sale of the port, currently leased by a Chinese company, will be a central topic of conversation with President Xi Jinping. This trip underscores the delicate balance Australia is trying to strike between its economic partnership with China and its strategic security concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that countries aligning with the "anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff, with no exceptions. This declaration came as he prepared to send out letters detailing new country-specific tariff rates and trade deals. The move coincides with a BRICS summit where leaders criticized unilateral US trade measures, creating further tension in global trade relations. The administration also confirmed that a 90-day pause on previously announced tariffs would end, with new rates potentially taking effect August 1. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chloe Childress, a recent high school graduate and counselor at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas, was among the victims of the catastrophic flash floods over the Fourth of July weekend. Remembered by her school as a compassionate and empathetic leader, Childress was set to attend the University of Texas at Austin. The flooding of the Guadalupe River was exceptionally severe, rising 26 feet in 45 minutes and causing at least 80 deaths in the region. Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, suffered numerous fatalities among its campers and staff in the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it continues to pose a significant flash flooding risk to the Carolinas and Virginia. The system brought heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 6 inches, leading to collapsed roads and numerous water rescues, particularly in Chatham County, North Carolina. The Haw River surged to near-record levels, prompting emergency notifications for residents in low-lying areas. While the storm is weakening as it moves northeast, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to persist along the Atlantic coast.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed Elon Musk's plan to launch a new political party, calling the idea "ridiculous" and a source of confusion for voters. Musk announced the formation of the "America Party" following a public feud with Trump over a major tax and spending bill that ended electric vehicle subsidies. The former allies have exchanged sharp criticisms, with Trump stating Musk has gone "off the rails." Musk's new party aims to challenge what he calls the Republican and Democratic "Uniparty," initially focusing on key House and Senate races.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with some participants in a clinical trial regaining significant hearing within weeks. The treatment involves a single injection into the inner ear, delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. In a trial of 10 individuals, all showed considerable improvement, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. Researchers are optimistic that this safe and well-tolerated method could pave the way for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress in controlling the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year. Containment of the 80,000-acre blaze has increased to 30%, aided by favorable weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 personnel. The fire, which started Wednesday, has threatened the Carrizo Plain National Monument and forced over 200 people to evacuate. Officials are hoping to bolster containment lines before a projected heat wave arrives midweek, which could create more challenging conditions.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have resumed in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli airstrikes continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent strikes killed at least 38 Palestinians, including 18 in a coastal area designated for displaced people. The talks are focused on a U.S.-led proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release in exchange for increased humanitarian aid. However, significant gaps remain, with Hamas demanding a guaranteed end to the war, a condition Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo amid their sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The team currently holds one of the worst records in the National League at 37-53. Rizzo had been the team's general manager since 2009, overseeing the construction of the championship roster, while Martinez managed the team since 2018. Ownership cited the team's poor on-field performance as the reason for the change, stating that a fresh approach was necessary for the club.</p>

Currently, statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people essential time away from work to grieve. The change, which has been championed by campaigners, is a significant step in acknowledging the emotional impact of early-stage pregnancy loss for both parents.</p>

          <p>Despite having one of the best records in baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers are showing some concerning signs, particularly after being swept by the Houston Astros. The team has a mediocre 20-19 record against winning teams, the kind they will exclusively face in the postseason. Furthermore, the roster has been battered by injuries to key players, including pitchers and position players like Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman. While manager Dave Roberts remains unconcerned, the team's performance against top-tier competition and its growing injury list raise questions about its championship contention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing uncertainty surrounding US tariff policy is compelling companies worldwide to undertake radical and costly restructuring of their global supply chains. With a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs set to expire, businesses are moving production out of China to countries like Vietnam and India to avoid high import taxes. An Illinois toymaker, for example, is shifting 16% of its manufacturing after its tax bill skyrocketed due to the 30% tariff on Chinese goods. This shift highlights the significant and potentially long-lasting impact of the trade war on international commerce and manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have evolved significantly, but they face a threat landscape that is far more complex and diverse. The 2005 attacks prompted major reforms, leading to closer collaboration between MI5 and police, better intelligence triage, and new laws for prosecuting plots earlier. However, the rise of self-radicalized, lone-actor attacks inspired by groups like ISIS and the far-right has created new challenges. This shift requires a different approach, relying on tools like the Prevent program and public vigilance to stop rapid, unpredictable violence.</p>

A doctor at a nearby building recounted setting up a makeshift triage area to treat victims of the bus bombing in Tavistock Square, making life-or-death decisions.
