          <p>Campaigning has officially started for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, drawing significant attention as a precursor to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can maintain its seats amidst approval ratings that have dipped below what is considered the "danger level." Parties are actively utilizing social media to connect with voters, particularly those who are unaffiliated. Key issues include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, and regional concerns such as child-rearing and measures against heat. The high number of candidates running in the assembly race reflects the intense competition and importance of this election. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, conducting airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, leading to a retaliatory launch of over 100 drones by Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at rolling back the Iranian threat, claiming intelligence revealed an Iranian plan to destroy Israel. The IDF reported eliminating senior Iranian security leadership and targeting Iran's aerial defense arrays. Iranian state media confirmed the strikes hit several cities, including Tehran and Natanz, while the IAEA stated that Iran's Fordo nuclear site was not impacted and no radiation increase was observed at Natanz. The exchange of fire disrupted international air travel, prompting airspace closures and flight cancellations across the region, with the U.S. urging Iran not to target U.S. interests or personnel. </p>

          <p>India is taking steps to tap into its rare earth element (REE) reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global supply. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative in the REE sector with increased public and private investment. The move follows recent restrictions from China that have caused shortages affecting auto manufacturers in various countries. India possesses substantial REE reserves, holding the world's third-largest share, but it currently lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan.

          <p>The Japanese government has announced a 100 billion yen policy package to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create an elite research environment amid global competition in fields like AI and semiconductors. The measures include funding existing programs and using profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support internationally competitive research at universities. This initiative aims to capitalize on potential talent migration from the United States due to research funding cuts and prioritization of American students. The government plans to raise salaries for researchers, reduce administrative burdens, and acquire advanced technology for institutions. </p>

          <p>Investors are flocking to safe-haven assets after a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iran, which escalated conflict in the region. Gold prices have risen to near two-month highs, and U.S. Treasury prices have increased, pushing yields lower. The market reaction is driven by fears of a wider regional conflict, prompting a risk-off move across various asset classes. The U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen, all considered safe havens, have also seen increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Israeli strikes on Iran, DW's Iran expert Theresa Tropper discussed the potential reactions of regular Iranians, noting that the strikes hit wealthier areas of Tehran. While some may not mourn the deaths of senior military commanders, attacks on residential areas causing civilian casualties could evoke a different response. Tropper suggests that Iranians may feel defenseless due to a lack of strong air defenses and allies, potentially leading to suspicions that the regime is primarily focused on its own survival. The strikes could impact the perception of the Iranian government's ability to protect its citizens. </p>

          <p>The newly elected Canadian government, led by Mark Carney, has introduced a border bill that is drawing criticism for its sweeping powers and alignment with US policies. Bill C-2, or the Strong Borders Act, grants law enforcement enhanced access to citizens' data and aligns Canada with stricter US refugee policies. The legislation changes the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, granting the immigration minister extensive powers to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake. Concerns are rising over potential infringements on privacy rights and the impact on vulnerable groups, including refugees and women. </p>

          <p>Japan has condemned Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, describing it as an "escalating situation" and pledging diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated it is "extremely regrettable" that Israel took military action despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran. Japan is demanding that all parties exercise "utmost restraint." The government will take all possible measures to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals living in the region, given Japan's reliance on crude oil imports from the Middle East. </p>

          <p>Iran and Israel have been adversaries for decades, with Iran expressing a desire to eliminate Israel. However, the two nations were allies until the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. After the revolution, Iran's new leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Today, some Iranians question the country's hostility towards Israel, while supporters of the Islamic Republic maintain their opposition. Analyst Ali Fathollah-Nejad suggests that some Iranian regime supporters are frustrated by Iran's reluctance to directly attack Israel. </p>

A letter of credit is a financial tool that guarantees payment to the seller. The domestic version serves similar functions, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. Domestic L/Cs can be used in transactions involving physical goods and services, with a payment period generally set at one year. (not investment advice)</p>

The VDMA's position paper calls for countervailing duties on imports from third countries violating EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules.
