          <p>Two 16-year-old boys have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa on a bus in Woolwich, London. The court heard that the attackers boarded the bus and stabbed Bokassa 27 times with machetes in a planned, 14-second assault while smiling. Kelyan's mother delivered a powerful victim impact statement, expressing her profound grief and questioning the origins of such violence in young people. The defendants, who cannot be named for legal reasons, must serve a minimum of 15 years and 10 months before being considered for parole.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe was failed by health professionals in the months leading up to his death by suicide in August 2024. The inquest heard that Thorpe had spiraled into depression after losing his job and had expressed suicidal thoughts to his wife. Despite these warnings, the community mental health team did not perceive him to be in a crisis situation, and he had not been seen in person for four months. The coroner noted significant "shortcomings" in his care but could not definitively conclude that they directly caused his death.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Sterling Williams, a plumber accused of helping ten inmates escape a New Orleans correctional facility, argues his client is being used as a scapegoat for systemic failures. Williams pleaded not guilty to charges that he aided the May jailbreak by turning off water to a cell, which allegedly allowed the inmates to crawl through a hole behind a toilet. His attorney points to the jail's degrading infrastructure, including broken locks and cameras, for which the sheriff had previously requested funding. The defense contends Williams is an innocent man with no criminal history, now being held on a $1 million bond.</p>

          <p>Current and former inmates speculate that convicted Idaho murderer Bryan Kohberger may face significant dangers in Idaho's maximum-security prison due to his reported social awkwardness. Experts compare his situation to that of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was reportedly killed in prison not for his notoriety but for unnerving fellow inmates with his strange behavior. Kohberger's alleged obsessive-compulsive tendencies and lack of social awareness, previously noted in court filings and by jail inmates, could mark him as a target in the harsh prison environment. He is now serving four consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to the murders of four university students.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Trump's visit to Scotland, local residents near his Aberdeenshire golf course hold divided opinions about their famous neighbor. Some, like David Milne, who refused to sell his property to Trump during the course's development, criticize the disruption of the natural landscape and the president's treatment of locals. Activists are planning protests, citing a clash between his policies and Scottish values, with polls indicating widespread unfavorable views of Trump. However, the course employs over 80 people, and some locals praise its positive economic impact and world-class quality, suggesting politics should be kept separate from golf.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's presidential trip to Scotland is being overshadowed by new reports detailing his past relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. According to The New York Times, Trump's name appears on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, adding to a controversy over an allegedly lewd note and drawing Trump denies sending. The president has dismissed the reports as fake news and is suing The Wall Street Journal over its story. This comes as his administration faces backlash for not releasing the full Epstein investigation files as previously promised.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has stated the NHS faces a challenging period as resident doctors in England commence a five-day strike over a pay dispute. While the government aims to minimize disruption by keeping non-urgent services running, the British Medical Association (BMA) has warned of staff being stretched too thin. The strike, the twelfth since March 2023, proceeds after talks failed, with the BMA seeking to restore pay levels eroded by inflation since 2008. The government maintains that pay is not negotiable, leading to an impasse that threatens to reverse recent progress in clearing patient backlogs.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick suggests that while artificial intelligence is not yet ready to fully replace human jobs, it poses a significant concern for the entry-level workforce. In an interview, Mollick explained that the primary challenge is not learning to use AI, but developing the expertise needed to oversee it, as traditional apprenticeship paths may disappear. He advises that jobs with multiple bundled tasks, like those of doctors, are more resilient to being replaced than single-focus roles. Mollick emphasizes that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration rather than expecting employees to figure it out individually.</p>

          <p>With more Americans claiming Social Security at the earliest possible age of 62, financial experts are highlighting strategies to delay benefits and secure larger monthly payments for life. To bridge the income gap, retirees can consider investing in an immediate or deferred income annuity, which can provide a steady stream of funds until they reach age 70. Another option for homeowners is a reverse mortgage, which allows them to tap into their home equity without having to make repayments until they sell or move. Finally, making catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can build a crucial financial cushion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France's pledge to recognize a Palestinian state has intensified political pressure on the UK government to follow suit, creating a potential diplomatic challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. While France hopes its move will build international momentum, the UK has traditionally argued that recognition should be a tool used at the end of a peace process, not the beginning. British officials fear being dragged into a symbolic gesture with little practical gain, but the government faces growing calls from its own MPs to act. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has maintained that recognition must be part of a process toward a secure two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump stated he believes the central bank is prepared to start lowering interest rates. Trump characterized the meeting as positive and interpreted Powell's comments on the country's economic well-being as a signal for future rate cuts. This comes after months of the president publicly pressuring the Fed for monetary policy easing to stimulate the economy. White House officials have also continued to advocate for lower rates and a review of the Federal Reserve's operations and management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the long and varied history of fountains, from their practical origins in ancient civilizations to their role as modern urban spectacles and cooling systems. Fountains first appeared nearly five millennia ago for practical and ritualistic purposes in Minoan Crete and ancient Egypt. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods in Europe, they evolved into grand symbols of power and artistry, such as Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome. Today, while some fountains are massive tourist attractions, many cities are adapting them with misting nozzles to provide relief from increasingly intense heatwaves, blending ancient purpose with modern necessity.</p>

          <p>A provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level is set to expire at the end of 2025, potentially creating significant tax burdens for borrowers. Without new legislation, debt canceled under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans will once again be treated as taxable income by the IRS. For a borrower with an average IDR balance of $57,000, this could result in a federal tax bill of over $12,000. Consumer advocates argue that taxing forgiven debt is a cruel policy that replaces one form of financial hardship with another for struggling borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

Symptoms of depression are similar across age groups but often present more somatically in the elderly, leading physicians to misattribute them to the normal aging process. This can result in delayed recognition and more chronic conditions. Treatment is complicated by potential interactions between antidepressants and other medications.

Throughout his presidency, Trump has used lawsuits and regulatory pressure to punish news organizations.
