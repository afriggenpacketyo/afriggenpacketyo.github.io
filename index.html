          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is capitalizing on a market pullback to increase its investment in GE Vernova (GEV). The trust purchased 35 shares of GEV, bringing its total holdings to 80 shares, representing 1.0% of the portfolio. The move follows a recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's, which triggered a market decline. GEV is positioned to benefit from increased investment in power and grid infrastructure, driven by data center expansion, manufacturing activity, and electric vehicle adoption. The company is also poised to gain from trade deals, including a $14 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia for gas turbines and energy solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is betting that the public is ready to move on from the divisive Brexit debates with a new UK-EU deal focused on pragmatic improvements. The agreement aims to smooth relations on issues like fishing rights and trade, but avoids reopening major questions like single market membership. Conservatives have criticized the deal as a 'surrender,' while the Liberal Democrats call for greater ambition. The deal's success hinges on whether the opposition parties choose to campaign heavily on Brexit or if the public embraces a less confrontational relationship with the EU.</p>

Initial reports suggest the ship lost power, causing it to drift into the bridge due to the current. An investigation into the incident is underway, and commercial water traffic near the bridge has been temporarily suspended.</p>

          <p>Health officials are urging continued vigilance against bird flu, but experts are puzzled by the recent absence of reported human cases in the U.S. Despite the virus spreading among wild birds, poultry, and cattle, new human infections have not been reported in the last three months. Some experts speculate that government cuts may have weakened case detection, while others suggest immigrant farm workers may be hesitant to seek testing due to deportation concerns. While the CDC maintains that the virus poses a low risk to the general public, every new infection raises the potential for mutations that could lead to more severe disease.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unearthed a 506-million-year-old fossil of a 'moth-like' predator named Mosura fentoni in British Columbia, Canada. This extinct arthropod possessed three eyes, spiny claws, a circular mouth with teeth, and swimming flaps. What sets this discovery apart is Mosura's abdomen-like body region with multiple segments, a feature previously unseen in radiodonts. This segmented structure, lined with gills, showcases an evolutionary convergence with modern creatures like horseshoe crabs and insects. The species, nicknamed the 'sea-moth,' offers unprecedented insights into the internal anatomy of ancient arthropods.</p>
