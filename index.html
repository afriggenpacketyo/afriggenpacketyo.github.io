            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. The ACLU argued that the deportations would send the detainees to dangerous foreign prisons without due process, referencing previous deportations to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. White House officials assert the detainees are foreign terrorists arrested in planned raids.</p>

            <p>Former White House "Border Czar" Tom Homan defends the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, claiming he is a violent MS-13 gang member and a public safety threat.  Homan argues that the administration does not have the authority to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return for trial, asserting that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of the El Salvador government. Homan also criticizes Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of not addressing border concerns.</p>

The interceptions occurred over the Baltic Sea and near Kaliningrad airspace, as part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing mission in Poland.  This operation, known as Operation Chessman, demonstrates the UK's commitment to NATO and its ability to work alongside new member Sweden to defend the alliance's airspace.  The UK has committed to increasing defense spending to 2.5% of GDP.</p>

            <p>Evangelical leaders are actively working to reclaim the phrase "Christ is King" from far-right and far-left groups who have weaponized it for hateful purposes, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI). The institute's research indicates that extremists have co-opted the phrase to rally support for ideologies that contradict Judeo-Christian values, with evidence suggesting bot activity and connections to the Chinese Communist Party amplifying antisemitic messages. Evangelical leaders emphasize that the phrase is a Christian expression of worship and cannot be used to promote hatred, particularly against Jewish people, underscoring the interconnectedness of Christianity and Judaism.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is set to present its case for breaking up Google in the final phase of a landmark antitrust trial.  The government argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying phone makers and web browsers to set Google as their default search engine, and is seeking remedies such as forcing Google to stop third-party payments and spin off its Chrome web browser and Android smartphone operating system. Google contends that the proposed remedies are inappropriate and would harm consumers and innovation.</p>

            <p>The article proposes that China should require bilateral trade with the US to be settled in renminbi as a more effective countermeasure to US tariffs. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar.  The mandatory use of the renminbi would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing its demand and value, and potentially encouraging global investors to shift their holdings to renminbi assets.</p>
