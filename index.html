          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects economic fundamentals during bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgment implies that the yen's previous weakness against the dollar should not be a point of contention in tariff discussions, contrasting President Trump's view that it contributes to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Kato voiced concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets. Japan remains firmly opposed to additional tariffs, particularly on auto exports to the U.S., a key economic driver. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes the enduring impact of immigration on UK politics, tracing its evolution from a class-based system to one influenced by identity politics. The 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech are highlighted as pivotal moments that shifted voter allegiances. Despite efforts by successive prime ministers, public concerns about immigration persist, driven by factors like the influx of Eastern European workers after the EU expansion in 2004. The current Labour government, elected on a promise to reduce migration, faces the challenge of balancing economic needs with public anxieties, navigating a complex landscape of evolving attitudes and concentrated hostility in certain segments of the population.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. This decision dismayed officials and residents who viewed the oversight as crucial for addressing the police department's history of violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices. Justice Department officials argued that such consent decrees are often ineffective, costly, and prolonged, while Minneapolis officials expressed their commitment to implementing the reforms outlined in the agreement despite the federal withdrawal. The Minneapolis police union welcomed the decision, acknowledging the need to rebuild community trust.</p>

The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including an EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend the move is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials have vowed to sue if the waivers are revoked, as the decision could impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's standards.</p>

This marine heatwave, intensified by a warm spring, is most pronounced off the west coast of Ireland and near Cornwall and Devon. Scientists anticipate 2025 to be among the hottest years on record for air temperatures, and they expect marine heatwaves to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. The long-term effects on marine ecosystems are still uncertain, but previous heatwaves have led to harmful algae blooms and mass mortality among mussels.</p>

          <p>Amidst claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa, some Afrikaners are pushing back against the narrative, stating that it is untrue. While President Trump has offered special treatment to Afrikaner asylum applicants, some community members argue that Whites remain economically strong in South Africa. They acknowledge violent attacks on farmers, but emphasize that racial motives are not generally a factor. They also point out that land expropriation has not occurred without compensation since the end of apartheid.</p>

          <p>Food banks in Florida are experiencing difficulties in providing aid due to recent federal funding cuts, impacting the ability to serve vulnerable populations. The cuts, which amount to 40% of Feeding South Florida's annual budget, have led to empty racks and longer lines for food distribution. These programs are essential for individuals like Rosalyn Budgett, who relies on the food bank to maintain a balanced meal. The situation also affects local farmers, who are losing partnerships to process surplus produce for families in need.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has strongly criticized the Trump administration for violating a court order by deporting a group of migrants to a country not their own with insufficient notice. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, said the administration's actions were "unquestionably violative" of his order and raised the possibility of criminal contempt penalties. The flight, carrying citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam, landed in Djibouti, prompting Judge Murphy to order access to lawyers and interviews for the deportees. The judge also criticized the administration's handling of a separate case involving a Guatemalan man.</p>

The weather service's heat advisory expired, but inland areas still experienced high temperatures. A brush fire in the Sepulveda Basin caused minor injuries and disruptions. Forecasters warn of a heightened risk of brush fires due to breezy conditions, but recent rains have lowered the overall risk.</p>
