          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision came despite significant pressure from President Trump to implement cuts and revealed a rare division within the committee, with two governors dissenting in favor of easing rates. The Fed's statement noted a moderation in economic growth and continued uncertainty, signaling a cautious approach while markets anticipate a potential rate cut in September.

          <p>The beverage company High Noon is recalling two lots of its vodka seltzer variety packs because some cans were incorrectly packaged as non-alcoholic Celsius energy drinks. This mislabeling poses a risk of unintended alcohol consumption, particularly as the affected cans look like the "Sparkling Blue Razz Edition" of Celsius. The recall affects products shipped to eight states, and consumers are advised to dispose of the cans and contact High Noon for a refund. No illnesses have been reported.</p>

          <p>A city councilman in Danville, Virginia, was hospitalized after being deliberately set on fire at his office in what police describe as a personal attack. The suspect allegedly doused Councilman Lee Vogler with a flammable liquid before igniting it. Authorities have a suspect in custody and have stated the assault is not related to Vogler's political position, but rather stems from a personal matter between the two individuals who reportedly knew each other. Vogler's condition remains unknown.</p>

          <p>Legislation aimed at prohibiting members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks has advanced out of a Senate committee with bipartisan support. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all committee Democrats in an 8-7 vote to move the bill forward, which is informally named the PELOSI Act. The measure faces an uncertain future for a full Senate vote but reflects growing public pressure for stricter ethics rules for lawmakers, though some Republicans on the panel defended the use of blind trusts.</p>

          <p>The city council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany, has ordered the demolition of a nearly finished mosque due to a breach of contract by the Islamic association building it. The association, VIKZ, was granted the building permit in 2014 but failed to complete construction within the contractually mandated four-year period. Despite a court ruling in the town's favor and an offer to help find an alternative site, the association has stated it will not comply with the demolition order, setting up a potential legal confrontation.</p>

However, executives indicate this strategy is not permanent, with potential price hikes, reduced financing deals, and shifts in production to the U.S. expected for future model years.

          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of declining same-store sales and missing earnings expectations, Starbucks is showing early signs of a successful turnaround, according to some Wall Street analysts. Executives highlighted that customer traffic improved each month during the quarter, with notable growth among non-rewards members, a key area of concern. While investors remain cautious, analysts are pointing to an accelerated rollout of new service initiatives and a more aggressive innovation agenda as reasons for optimism about future performance.

          <p>Tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast, have been downgraded or canceled after a massive earthquake near Russia. While the quake generated tsunami waves, with crests reaching nearly six feet in Hawaii, the threat of catastrophic flooding has receded. Authorities advised residents who had evacuated coastal areas that it was safe to return home but urged continued caution near the water due to the risk of strong and unpredictable currents that can persist for hours after the initial waves.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a 25% tariff will be imposed on all goods from India starting August 1, along with an unspecified "penalty" for India's continued trade with Russia. Trump justified the move by citing India's high tariffs and trade barriers, its large U.S. trade surplus, and its significant purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia. The announcement escalates trade tensions with a key partner and links trade policy directly to geopolitical alignments, particularly regarding Russia's actions in Ukraine.

          <p>England's cricket team faces a significant blow as captain and star all-rounder Ben Stokes has been ruled out of the final, decisive Test match against India due to a shoulder injury.

His absence not only jeopardizes England's chances of securing a series win but also raises concerns about his fitness for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, forcing the team to confront a difficult scenario of playing without their talisman.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a former personal attorney for Donald Trump, has been confirmed in a narrow 50-49 vote to a lifetime position as a federal appeals court judge.

Bove, who defended Trump in his Manhattan criminal trial and previously worked as a federal prosecutor, insisted during his confirmation hearing that he is "not anybody's henchman."</p>

The jury could not reach a verdict on assault charges against Amaaz and his brother concerning a third male officer, and prosecutors are seeking a retrial on those counts.

          <p>This article examines the role of annuities for retirees who already have a steady income from Social Security. While both provide regular payments, an annuity can offer an additional, diversified income stream, acting as a hedge against outliving one's savings, especially for those with long life expectancies or low risk tolerance. However, annuities require a significant upfront investment, which reduces liquidity, and can come with complex fees and terms, making them unsuitable for everyone. The decision depends on individual financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is invoking a little-known federal law to compel the Trump administration's Justice Department to release its investigative files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Citing a law that allows a committee to request any information within its jurisdiction, eight senators have set an August 15 deadline for Attorney General Pam Bondi to hand over the documents. This move represents an escalation in the congressional effort to obtain the files after the administration reneged on earlier promises to declassify and release them to the public.</p>

This signals a shift to a renter's market, particularly in formerly hot southern and western cities like Austin and Phoenix, as the market continues to absorb an oversupply of new units built over the last few years.
