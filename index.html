            <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves rejected calls for a 'Buy British' media campaign, deeming it 'inward looking' and not the appropriate strategy in response to Trump's tariffs. While ruling out a public campaign, the government is reviewing procurement rules to favor British firms for government contracts. Prime Minister Starmer also declined to officially support a 'Buy British' initiative, emphasizing the UK's commitment to open trade. The government prioritizes securing a trade deal with the U.S. and aims to help industry navigate the global economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. aims to secure fair and beneficial trade agreements with all nations, even as President Trump's tariffs continue to affect global markets. Trump dismissed the possibility of pausing tariffs for negotiations, asserting that numerous countries are eager to negotiate deals with the U.S. He also threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and warned of additional tariffs on China in response to retaliatory measures, potentially raising the total tariff to 104%. These actions underscore the administration's firm stance on trade and its willingness to use tariffs as leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

The agencies highlight the dire conditions in Gaza, including the closure of UN-supported bakeries, empty markets, and hospitals rationing medical supplies.

          </div>

            <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but with the stipulation that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. This law, originally enacted during a potential war with France, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of enemy nations during war or invasion. The Trump administration is using it to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang membership, arguing they pose an 'invasion or predatory incursion'. Critics question the legality of using the Act in this context, but the Supreme Court's decision allows deportations to proceed with due process.</p>

Instead, manufacturers are considering relocating to countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia to mitigate the impact of the 49% tariff on Cambodian goods. While the Cambodian government is exploring fiscal policies to alleviate the pressure, uncertainty prevails, leading to a pause in new orders. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Post Office intends to sell off its remaining 108 directly-owned branches, transitioning to a fully franchised network. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has urged government intervention to explore alternative options. Potential retail partners, including Tesco and Ryman, have expressed interest in acquiring the branches. The Post Office claims this move will protect community access to services and enable increased remuneration for postmasters. The CWU criticizes the franchising model as a 'full privatization' of the Post Office.</p>

            <p>Iranian officials have confirmed that Tehran will engage in 'indirect' high-level talks with U.S. representatives in Oman this weekend regarding Iran's nuclear program, contradicting President Trump's claim that the negotiations are 'direct'. Trump stated that direct talks had commenced and a significant meeting would occur, while Iranian officials insist the talks will be indirect. Iran's Foreign Minister Araghchi described the meeting as both an opportunity and a test. This discrepancy highlights the complex dynamics and ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Iran.</p>

            <p>The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is facing criticism for its reporting on Eid al-Fitr, specifically its use of the term 'revert' to describe converts to Islam. The term 'revert' implies that all humans are born Muslim and that conversion is a return to their original state. Critics argue that the BBC, as a public broadcaster, should maintain impartiality and avoid presenting Islamic ideological doctrine as fact. This incident has raised concerns about the BBC's sensitivity and consideration towards Britain's diverse religious landscape.</p>
