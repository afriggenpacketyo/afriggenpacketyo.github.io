          <p>The article describes a protest in Los Angeles where the atmosphere shifted between a block party-like feel and tense confrontations with law enforcement. Initially, protesters chanted slogans about immigration, but the situation escalated when police used flash-bang grenades, leading to clashes. The protesters threw bottles at the police, who dodged the projectiles. Waymo driverless cars were set on fire nearby, highlighting the intensity of the situation and the diverse sentiments driving the demonstrations. The events reflect broader tensions and changing dynamics within the city. Optimism is low given the violence and destruction.</p>

          <p>UAE oil giant ADNOC is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, amid speculation of a potential BP takeover. ADNOC's interest comes as BP faces underperformance and strategic reset efforts, including increasing oil and gas spending while cutting back on renewables. Analysts suggest a full takeover by ADNOC is unlikely due to ADNOC's primary interest in gas assets, but other oil majors like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron could be potential suitors. The report underscores BP's vulnerability and the ongoing shifts in the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran announced plans to establish a new uranium enrichment facility in a secure location after the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors found Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations. The IAEA's resolution, supported by 19 countries, demands Iran provide answers regarding uranium traces at undeclared sites, raising suspicions of a secret nuclear weapons program until 2003. The U.S. State Department is reducing non-essential staff in the Middle East due to rising tensions.

          <p>Large-scale protests against mass tourism are planned across Spain, driven by concerns over overcrowded city centers, housing shortages, and a "tourism-first culture" that prioritizes the industry over local residents' quality of life. Activists in cities like Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca are protesting the increasing number of short-term rentals and the displacement of locals. Despite the backlash, Spain is expecting record numbers of tourists, prompting the government to implement stricter regulations on vacation rentals. Protesters seek a debate on the limits of tourism and concrete actions to improve residents' lives, as the sector's growth is straining the cities.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, has formally condemned Iran for breaching its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost two decades. The IAEA's board of governors passed a resolution citing Iran's failure to provide credible explanations for uranium traces at undeclared sites. In response, Iran announced it would open a new enrichment site and upgrade centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility. This move could escalate tensions between the West and Iran, potentially leading to the restoration of United Nations sanctions on Tehran later this year, which raises concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>Five staff members of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US-backed aid delivery company, were killed in an attack in Gaza, with fears that others may have been taken hostage. The GHF reported that Hamas attacked a bus carrying its team, who were working to deliver critical aid. The US firm has been controversial since taking over aid in Gaza, as part of a plan to prevent aid from falling into Hamas's hands. The GHF holds Hamas responsible for the deaths, citing previous threats, while NGOs criticize the new system for forcing Palestinians to travel long distances for unsuitable food, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>
