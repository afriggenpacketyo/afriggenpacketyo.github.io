          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has issued an apology for incorrectly describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The misinformation appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, leading to strong public criticism and prompting the company to take the video offline and correct the inaccurate phrasing. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands of people who consumed contaminated seafood near Minamata Bay in Kumamoto Prefecture. The company has been urged to make corrections by patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry.</p>

          <p>The UK's South Western Railways has become the first private operator to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander called it a watershed moment, aiming to end 30 years of fragmentation and improve services for passengers. Rail unions have welcomed the move, citing the poor reputation of privatized rail services due to frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. The Labour government estimates that renationalization will save up to Â£150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators. </p>

Evidence recovered from the scene included weapons, body armor, and disturbing photographs of the victim. Woeltz is being held in custody as a flight risk, while the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has declined to prosecute a second individual pending further investigation.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a California mother, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000, but was later falsely portrayed as a criminal during the trial of her kidnappers. Renee and her daughter Breea were held hostage, strapped with fake dynamite, and threatened by gunmen who demanded she steal money from the bank where she worked. Despite her cooperation under duress, Renee's past, including a period working as a stripper, was used to discredit her during the trial, but the kidnappers were ultimately convicted.

These policies include mask requirements, temperature checks, time limits, and visitor restrictions, and one doctor recounted his family's difficulty visiting his wife's mother in the hospital.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who dwell on work-related problems may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners who frequently ruminate about work during their free time showed more signs of stress, such as whining and pacing. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their canine companions. Dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in care routines, making it essential for employed dog owners to avoid work-related rumination at home to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

          <h2>Woman's Racist Tweet Sparks Free Speech Debate in UK</h2>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's online post, calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire, has ignited a debate about free speech in the UK after she was sentenced to 31 months in jail for inciting racial hatred. While some argue her sentence is excessive and a violation of free speech, others maintain that it's a necessary consequence for inciting violence. The Free Speech Union has supported Connolly's appeal, raising concerns about police overreach in monitoring online activity, but critics argue that her words constituted a dangerous call to action.</p>

          <p>Amid significant shifts in the global order, particularly concerning US-China relations, Hong Kong's unique position and economic structure offer opportunities to bolster the rules-based international system. Concerns persist regarding China's economic model, particularly its high production and low consumption rates, which some view as disruptive to the global economy. Hong Kong can potentially facilitate measures to promote a more balanced economic approach, contributing to a more stable and predictable international environment.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is drafting a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States. The agency argues that emissions from these plants do not significantly contribute to climate change, a claim disputed by scientists. The EPA sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2, and it could undergo changes before it is formally released for public comment. The Trump administration is uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, with the EPA at the epicenter of this effort.</p>
