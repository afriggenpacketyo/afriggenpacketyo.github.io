          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air attacks of the war, deploying over 500 drones and missiles against Ukraine. During the defense, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was lost, and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, was killed after reportedly shooting down seven targets. Ustimenko guided his damaged plane away from a residential area before it crashed, and he was unable to eject. The massive overnight assault prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution.</p>

          <p>A recent incident where a Delta passenger was told to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted inconsistencies in airline policies. While the TSA permits these products in carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines set their own rules for in-flight use. Delta's policy explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches, yet other airlines' rules are less clear, leading to confusion and debate among travelers. The ambiguity exists despite some in-flight magazines even featuring advertisements for such products.</p>

          <p>Recent events have cast doubt on Europe's ability to act as an independent geopolitical force, particularly as it prepares for a summit with China. Following a period of internal disarray and criticism over defense spending commitments, Europe's perceived weakness on the global stage is becoming more apparent. This comes after months of discussions about achieving strategic autonomy, especially in the context of a potential shift in US foreign policy.

During their energetic set, the trio led chants of "Free Palestine" and thanked festival organizers for resisting pressure to cancel their appearance.

Grossi clarified that while the damage was severe, it was not total, and Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program.

The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an act of rage, not a premeditated hate crime.

However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing its much smaller satellite constellation and more limited launch capabilities. While Eutelsat may succeed in government and enterprise sectors, catching up in the mass-market broadband space remains a formidable challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle collision on Interstate 15 in San Diego caused a car to burst into flames and led to a complete shutdown of southbound lanes on Saturday night. According to the California Highway Patrol, the incident involved at least four vehicles and occurred when one car rear-ended another. The impact sent one of the vehicles into a highway divider, where it caught fire. At least one person was transported to the hospital, and traffic was significantly stalled as authorities worked to clear the scene.</p>

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. This move is part of a plan to bolster border security against a potential Russian threat by deploying land mines as a deterrent. The strategy is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. This plan would create a new, explosive "Iron Curtain," reflecting deep concerns about regional security and a significant shift in defense posture.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani demonstrated continued progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his major league career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 mph. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss.

The ban also applies to bus shelters but notably excludes the terraces of bars and restaurants, and it does not mention e-cigarettes. Violators could face fines, though an initial grace period will be observed as the public adjusts to the new restrictions.</p>

          <p>A lay preacher for the Church of England, Venessa Pinto, has been convicted of stalking after subjecting a poet and church volunteer, Jay Hulme, to a 21-month campaign of severe online harassment. The abuse began after Hulme, who is a gay trans man, declined her romantic advances. The article details how Hulme's complaints were initially dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, who accused Hulme of witchcraft, before police and the church eventually took action. The case highlights significant failings in how both the police and the church handled the serious allegations.</p>

Advocacy groups express concern that ICE is rounding up Iranians indiscriminately, fueled by recent military tensions. The arrests signal a significant shift, as deportation to Iran was previously rare due to severed diplomatic relations.</p>
