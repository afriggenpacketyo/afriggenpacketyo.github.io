        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa is currently debating the decriminalization of sex work, a move supported by activists who argue it would improve safety and reduce violence against the country's estimated 150,000 sex workers. Proponents, including the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT), highlight high rates of violence and sexual assault, which often go unreported due to fear of arrest. Opponents, such as the Cause for Justice, contend that decriminalization would degrade women and promote trafficking. The outcome of a crucial trial in May 2026 could set a precedent for sex workers' rights and access to justice and healthcare.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially called for the release of 30 leaders from Zion Church, one of China's largest underground Christian networks, who were detained in coordinated raids across several cities. This crackdown is seen by some as the most significant persecution of Christians in China in decades, reflecting the Communist Party's tight control over religion. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, condemned the arrests as an affront to religious freedom, adding another layer of tension to the already strained U.S.-China relationship. The detentions highlight the growing conflict between unregistered house churches and Beijing's policy of religious Sinicisation.</p>

At 33, Wilshere will succeed Matt Bloomfield, who was recently sacked after less than a year in charge. Wilshere, who retired from playing in 2022, previously managed Arsenal's under-18 team and served as a first-team coach at Norwich City. He will be joined by former England international Chris Powell as his assistant, tasked with reviving a Luton side that currently sits 11th in the third tier following two consecutive relegations.</p>

          <p>As part of a ceasefire agreement, Hamas has begun releasing some of the 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive. The article provides detailed information on the individuals, who were abducted during the attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. It profiles those who have been released, such as Eitan Mor and Alon Ohel from the Nova music festival, and those who are scheduled for release.

          <p>Australia is formulating a plan for a A$1.2 billion critical minerals reserve, focusing on securing future production sales to allies rather than creating a large physical stockpile. The government is consulting with miners to finalize the policy, which is expected to be ready by 2026 and concentrate on resources like rare earths. This initiative aims to counter supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly from China, which recently tightened its own export restrictions. The policy discussions are intensifying ahead of a meeting between Australian and U.S. leaders, highlighting the strategic importance of securing these essential resources.

          <p>Lloyds Banking Group has increased its provision for compensating customers in the car finance scandal by an additional £800 million, bringing its total allocation to nearly £2 billion. The move follows proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for a redress scheme covering millions of drivers who were sold finance deals with hidden commission payments between 2007 and 2024. The FCA estimates that the scandal could cost lenders a total of £8.2 billion, with around 14 million unfair deals eligible for payouts. Lloyds stated the potential impact is at the adverse end of its expectations due to a higher anticipated number of eligible claims. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts suggest that companies will likely reduce share buybacks first to avoid the negative market signal of cutting dividends.

The think tank suggests that reforming property taxes, such as updating council tax valuations from their 1991 basis, and fixing existing wealth-related taxes would be fairer and more growth-friendly.
