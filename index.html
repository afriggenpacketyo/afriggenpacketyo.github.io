          <p>A tourist boat, the Wonder Seas, carrying 53 people, capsized in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay during a sudden thunderstorm, resulting in at least 28 fatalities and 14 missing individuals. The majority of passengers were Vietnamese families from the capital, Hanoi. Rescue efforts have been complicated by heavy rain, but 11 people have been pulled alive from the water, including a 14-year-old boy who survived for four hours trapped in an air pocket within the upturned hull, and a 10-year-old boy now in stable condition. Authorities are continuing extensive search operations to find the remaining missing persons, as Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has offered his condolences to the families affected by this tragic event.</p>

          <p>Over 60 individuals have been arrested across the UK during protests against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terror group under the Terrorism Act of 2000. Demonstrations occurred in cities like London, Edinburgh, and Bristol, where participants displayed placards supporting the activist group, leading to swift police action and arrests, including many older individuals. The proscription followed an incident where Palestine Action activists allegedly caused £7 million in damage at an RAF base. The group's co-founder is set to challenge the ban in a High Court hearing, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding the classification of protest and national security.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has endured another widespread wave of Russian air attacks, which resulted in at least three fatalities in the Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa, and caused significant damage across ten Ukrainian regions. The military reported intercepting 90% of over 340 explosive and dummy drones and missiles, but more than 30 still impacted targets, including residential blocks, industrial sites, and critical infrastructure in cities like Odesa, Pavlohrad, and Sumy. President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated the critical importance of strengthening air defenses through international supplies and domestic production. Meanwhile, Russia stated it targeted military-industrial enterprises, as ground forces continue efforts to encircle Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.</p>

          <p>Former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne has once again publicly criticized The New York Times for its controversial 2022 article, "New Endorsements for College Athletes Resurface an Old Concern: Sex Sells," which featured her photo with the infamous headline. Dunne alleges that the newspaper's staff instructed her to wear team-issued attire for the photo, then used it to promote a narrative about female athletes' desirability over athletic excellence. She recounted mocking the article on social media, which unexpectedly led to a modeling offer from Sports Illustrated. Dunne maintains the article was "BS" and contained "odd" questions, highlighting her ongoing frustration with the article's framing and its implications for female college athletes.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly revoked the US visas of eight of Brazil's 11 Supreme Court judges, signaling an escalation in Washington's campaign to support former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged military coup attempt. This action follows increased pressure from Donald Trump, including a recent threat of 50% tariffs on all Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva strongly denounced the visa cancellations as "unacceptable interference" and an affront to national sovereignty, emphasizing that no intimidation would compromise Brazil's democratic rule of law. The interventions have triggered widespread nationalist anger in Brazil, even drawing criticism from influential right-wing voices who view them as an attack on the country's domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the often-unrealistic expectations placed on family vacations, arguing that travel is not a panacea for life's inherent tensions. It suggests that while such trips are intended for bonding and experiencing new places, they do not fundamentally change who individuals are or resolve underlying issues. The piece explores how the concept of family trips has evolved, particularly with the rise of multi-generational travel, and offers guidance on how to make the most of time with loved ones by managing expectations. It advocates for planning ahead and embracing radical self-acceptance rather than seeking a perfect, transformative experience.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that releasing grand jury transcripts in the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases would not satisfy "troublemakers and radical left lunatics," despite his administration's request for the Department of Justice to unseal them. This comes amidst weeks of mounting pressure on Trump, including from his own supporters, to release files related to Epstein, who died in 2019 after being arrested on federal child sexual assault charges. Trump's language regarding the request subtly shifted from "pertinent" to "all" testimony. The article also highlights Trump's recent defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, following a Wall Street Journal article describing a "bawdy" letter allegedly sent by Trump for Epstein's 50th birthday, which Trump vehemently denies writing.</p>

Neuralink, which is developing brain-computer interfaces to help people with severe paralysis, stated that the box on the SAM.gov filing was "erroneously checked" and has since been updated. The filing's timing is notable as it occurred while Musk led a government efficiency initiative aimed at reducing the size and funding of federal agencies, including those emphasizing diversity.</p>

The health and safety officer even resigned in protest, yet work continued, with problems allegedly "covered up." Macpherson is now advocating for criminal accountability for those found negligent, as many survivors continue to grapple with trauma, medical bills, and financial struggles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 days after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs, experts are assessing their economic impact, noting higher-than-expected tax revenue and commitments from companies to invest in new U.S. production. Analysts caution, however, that these company commitments carry long time horizons and may not fully materialize due to the fluctuating nature and legal uncertainties of the tariff policy. Tariffs have also begun to modestly increase some consumer prices, risking a bout of inflation that could pressure the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated, potentially slowing the economy. Despite initial market fears, the U.S. economy has largely continued to perform well, though the long-term effects on trade balances and consumer costs remain a subject of ongoing debate.

Legal and policy experts anticipate a messy courtroom scenario with uncertain impacts on financial markets and the broader economy. Trump's ongoing criticism of Powell primarily stems from the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates, with the president now publicly questioning Powell's management of the Fed's $2.5 billion building expansion as a possible "cause" for dismissal. Analysts warn that such overt political interference could undermine the Fed's crucial independence and inflation-fighting credibility, potentially leading to higher long-term interest rates and worsening the fiscal position.

Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach supports this view, advising young people to identify their unique talents and find the intersection point where their passion, what truly matters, and their marketable skills align.

These unsettled weather conditions follow a third heatwave that parched swathes of the UK, making the dry ground less able to absorb water and consequently increasing the risk of severe flooding.

These measures, including requiring Mexican airlines to file schedules and seek prior approval for charter flights, aim to address competitive imbalances and ensure compliance with air agreements, impacting the most popular international destination for U.S. travelers.

          <p>Congress has approved President Donald Trump's request to claw back $9 billion in previously approved federal spending, including funds allocated for foreign aid and public broadcasting. This action is viewed as a significant "test case" for future appropriations, potentially signaling a shift from a historically bipartisan budgeting process to a purely partisan one, as rescissions requests require only 51 Senate votes for approval. Experts from The Atlantic's Washington Week panel suggest this development could dramatically alter how the federal government is budgeted for years to come. The approval reflects the Trump administration's broader goal of moving away from traditional bipartisan budget negotiations and exerting greater executive control over spending.

          <p>A 61-year-old man tragically died from severe injuries after being pulled into an MRI machine by a large metallic chain he was wearing at Nassau Open MRI in Westbury, Long Island. Police reported that the man entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress, defying orders to stay out, after hearing a relative screaming during their scan. The powerful magnetic force of the machine pulled the chain around his neck, drawing him into the device. Doctors emphasize the critical importance of strict MRI safety protocols, which require patients to remove all metal and electrical objects, due to the potentially catastrophic dangers involved. Experts note that injuries and deaths from objects being pulled into MRI machines are rare when proper procedures are followed.</p>

          <p>At least 32 Palestinians seeking food were reportedly killed by Israeli gunfire near two aid distribution points close to Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The incidents occurred near sites operated by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which denies direct incidents at its locations but acknowledged Israeli Defense Forces activity nearby. Eyewitnesses described the gunfire as "targeted to kill." The UN human rights office has previously recorded hundreds of killings in the vicinity of GHF sites, which the UN refuses to cooperate with, citing a lack of evidence for Hamas systematically diverting aid.

Officials acknowledged the "severe" situation, noting that offenders continue to collude with foreign parties and employ increasingly covert tactics, such as false declarations and transshipment through third countries, to illegally export valuable resources. A special operation launched in May has already resulted in multiple arrests. Authorities are emphasizing the need for relevant departments to take full responsibility, maintain strict investigation and enforcement, and firmly prevent the illegal outflow of strategic minerals and related technologies, underscoring the government's commitment to safeguarding national resources.</p>

His charismatic presence and optimistic demeanor coincided with China and the US agreeing on a framework for trade negotiations and pushing ahead with approvals for certain technology and rare earth exports.

          <p>A recent survey reveals Americans believe a net worth of $839,000, on average, would make them "financially comfortable," though Gen Z anticipates needing less. However, financial experts, including certified financial planner and therapist Joy Slabaugh, caution that net worth is often a "misleading" metric. They argue it provides only a snapshot of wealth, not a full picture of financial reality, as it doesn't account for cash flow or lifestyle intentions. Instead, experts advise focusing on aligning money management with core values, ensuring debt repayment, building emergency savings, and investing for the future. They emphasize that true financial comfort is often more emotional, stemming from purpose-driven financial choices, rather than achieving a specific numerical target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The IRS has quietly reversed its long-standing ban on clergy endorsing political candidates from the pulpit, a significant change stemming from a lawsuit brought by evangelical groups. This decision, influenced by the Trump administration, now allows churches a more pronounced role in electoral politics, but it has sparked concerns that religious institutions could become de facto political organizations. Critics argue this shift risks degrading the church's spiritual mission by prioritizing earthly political interests and potentially alienating congregants. While some hope for increased political influence, others, like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, maintain that the church's proper role is to form the conscience of believers, rather than dictating votes or granting faith's imprimatur to ordinary politicians.</p>

          <p>ArcelorMittal's decision to halt its decarbonization plans and return €1.3 billion in subsidies has cast significant doubt on Germany's ambitious goal of achieving carbon-neutral steel production by 2045.

This pullout highlights the immense challenges of transitioning to green steel, including high upfront costs, the current expense of green hydrogen, and the difficulty of ensuring a reliable supply.

Public health officials confirm there is no association between sunscreen use and a higher risk of cancer, refuting a misleading chart that circulated online. The piece explains that rising global skin cancer rates are more accurately attributed to factors such as improved diagnostics, increased time spent outdoors, and potentially outdated scientific studies, rather than sunscreen itself. It also highlights that despite the growing global sunscreen market, many individuals do not use the product correctly or consistently, undermining its protective benefits. Experts warn against drawing false conclusions from a lack of specific country-by-country data on sunscreen use versus cancer prevalence.</p>

This move, intended to exert discipline, has prompted questions about his control over the backbenches and the overall coherence of government operations. Senior officials and MPs report a sense of chaos and contradictory instructions within Whitehall, with some suggesting the government lacks a clear "governing plan" and struggles to "inhabit its power." Financial markets also exert significant influence, forcing fiscal caution to avoid a situation like the Truss government's collapse. Ultimately, while internal and external forces jostle for control, the public's opinion remains the ultimate determinant of the government's trajectory.</p>
