          <p>Stocks for clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and various solar firms, experienced a significant drop following the introduction of new provisions in President Trump's proposed spending legislation. The bill includes a new tax on wind and solar projects that use components from China and also accelerates the phase-out of crucial tax credits for renewable energy projects. This legislative shift has created uncertainty and execution risk for developers, compressing project timelines and potentially jeopardizing future investments in the sector. The move has drawn criticism from industry leaders like Elon Musk, who warned of job losses and strategic harm to the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major NHL trade, the Toronto Maple Leafs have sent All-Star forward Mitch Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights. The deal, reportedly a sign-and-trade agreement, sends center Nic Roy to Toronto in return.

This move marks a significant shift for Toronto as they continue their quest for a Stanley Cup, while bolstering the Golden Knights' offensive power.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is moving closer to a final vote on President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a sweeping package of tax and policy changes, as Republicans aim to pass it by July 4th. The process has been marked by intense partisan debate, with Democrats using procedural tactics like a marathon reading of the 940-page bill to highlight their opposition. A "vote-a-rama" on numerous amendments is underway, testing Republican unity. The bill's passage in the Senate is not guaranteed, facing opposition from some moderate Republicans concerned about its cuts to programs like Medicaid, which has already led to significant political drama within the GOP.</p>

An executive from the company stated that while the decision aligns with their long-term strategy of manufacturing products closer to their consumers, recent U.S. trade policies and tariffs on Chinese imports accelerated the timeline. The company plans to cease its manufacturing operations in China once the new Louisville facility becomes fully operational, which is expected by early 2027. This reshoring effort reflects a broader trend among U.S. companies adjusting to the current economic and policy environment.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments regarding the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798, to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU, representing the migrants, argues that the act was intended for wartime and that applying it to a criminal gang is an overreach of executive power. Conversely, the Justice Department contends that the president has the authority to determine what constitutes an "invasion or predatory incursion" and that the court cannot second-guess this determination. The case hinges on whether a modern criminal gang's activities can be legally equated to a wartime threat under the historic statute.</p>

This decision is a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights advocates, who believe it provides legal certainty for same-sex couples on the islands.

          <p>Film producer Randall Emmett has been removed from the Writers Guild of America's "strike list" after paying over $630,000 to resolve a long-standing debt. The payment settles a dispute from 2019 where Emmett's former production company failed to pay compensation and benefits to four writers for a television project that was never produced. This resolution means WGA members are now permitted to work with Emmett and his current production company, Convergence Entertainment Group. The move clears a significant professional obstacle for the producer as he seeks to move forward with new projects, including a planned collaboration with director Martin Scorsese.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a new wave of inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable. Economists point to several short-term strategies that companies have employed to absorb the initial impact of the new trade policies. These tactics include "front-loading" inventory by pre-ordering goods before tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing the increased costs to avoid alienating customers, and utilizing legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While these measures have buffered consumers from immediate price hikes, experts caution that the effects of the tariffs will likely become more apparent in the latter half of the year.

          <p>Stanford University is set to cut $140 million from its budget for the upcoming academic year, a decision the administration attributes to "consequences from federal policy changes." In a letter to the community, the university president and provost cited reductions in federal research funding and the potential impact of an increased tax on the university's large endowment. These cuts are expected to lead to staff layoffs, following a hiring freeze implemented earlier in the year. While faculty hiring will continue at a slower pace, the university emphasized the need to be realistic about the current financial landscape while continuing to advocate for federal support for research and education.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his attacks on President Trump's major tax-and-spending bill, calling it a "DEBT SLAVERY bill" and vowing to support primary challengers against any fiscally conservative Republicans who vote for it. The Tesla CEO, a significant political donor, criticized the legislation for its massive increase to the national debt and its rollback of clean energy tax credits. In a series of posts on his social media platform, Musk also floated the idea of creating a new political party to challenge what he views as reckless government spending. His vocal opposition adds a high-profile element of pressure as the bill moves through the final stages of the legislative process.</p>

          <p>Consumers may face higher prices and fewer choices for fireworks this Fourth of July, a direct consequence of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. With over 95% of American fireworks imported from China, the industry is particularly vulnerable to trade policy shifts. A 30% tariff has disrupted the supply chain, as many importers delayed or halted shipments earlier in the year when even higher levies were threatened. Major vendors like Phantom Fireworks have indicated that while they will absorb some of the increased costs, prices on a significant portion of their products will be affected, potentially dampening some Independence Day celebrations across the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump has repeatedly and damagingly drawn a moral equivalence between the United States and authoritarian nations like China and Russia. The author points to a recent interview where Trump, when asked about China's hostile actions, responded by suggesting the U.S. engages in similar behavior. The piece contends that this rhetoric is not a sophisticated foreign policy stance but a lazy and nihilistic dismissal of America's unique role as a democratic leader. By portraying the world as a universally "nasty" place, Trump undermines the principles of American exceptionalism and discourages citizens from holding their government to a higher standard.</p>

          <p>President Trump's reconciliation bill contains significant changes to Medicaid that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Senate version of the bill would reduce federal spending on the program by $1 trillion and leave an estimated 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. A key provision imposes new work requirements for many adults, which experts warn could disproportionately affect older Americans and those with health issues who are unable to work. Health policy analysts also caution that the deep cuts risk the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers that rely heavily on Medicaid revenue.</p>

The legislation aims to defund Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers for at least a decade, which could lead to hundreds of clinic closures even in states where abortion is legal. Furthermore, the bill would slash Medicaid, impacting access to all forms of medical care for low-income individuals, and it creates incentives for insurers to drop abortion coverage from Affordable Care Act plans.

However, the promotional video of the event revealed an embarrassing flaw: the autonomous vehicle parked itself illegally in a "NO PARKING FIRE LANE." This incident adds to the growing scrutiny of Tesla's self-driving technology, which has faced criticism and regulatory attention for other documented traffic violations and safety issues. While the company hailed the delivery as a major achievement, the illegal parking flub provided fresh ammunition for critics who argue the technology prioritizes spectacle over safety.</p>

          <h2>Yale Analysis Concludes Republican Spending Bill Disproportionately Benefits the Wealthy</h2>

          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab finds that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would primarily benefit high-income households while financially harming the lowest-earning Americans. The report projects that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, largely due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In contrast, the top 20% of earners would see their incomes rise by an average of 2.2%, mainly from the extension of tax cuts. These findings align with other nonpartisan analyses suggesting the bill's policies are regressive in nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized AT&T's service in a series of social media posts, claiming the carrier's equipment failed during a conference call he was attempting to hold. He urged the "Boss of AT&T" to get involved and suggested he would use a different carrier for future calls. The posts came just two weeks after the Trump Organization announced a licensing deal for a new wireless service called Trump Mobile, which will operate over all three major U.S. carrier networks, including AT&T. This timing has raised questions, as it is another instance of the president's business interests overlapping with his public statements.</p>

          <h2>Senator Mike Lee Withdraws Controversial Public Lands Sale Provision from GOP Bill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Mike Lee of Utah has removed a contentious provision from the Republican budget bill that would have allowed for the sale of public lands in several Western states. Lee stated he withdrew the measure due to an inability to secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. The proposal had faced significant bipartisan opposition from lawmakers in other Western states, who feared losing public access to recreational areas. The removal of the provision resolves a key point of internal GOP disagreement as the bill moves forward.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that the royal train, a dedicated service for the monarch since the reign of Queen Victoria, will be taken out of service by 2027. This decision is part of a broader cost-saving initiative aimed at ensuring "value for money" in royal finances. The announcement coincided with the release of the annual royal financial report, which showed a single two-day trip on the train cost over Â£44,000, while it was only used on two occasions all year. The Royal Family will continue to use regular train services for travel, and the historic train may be put on public display after its final tour.</p>
