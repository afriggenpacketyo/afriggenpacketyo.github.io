          <p>Vice President JD Vance toured a federal law enforcement operations center and met with Marines in Los Angeles, marking the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit since protests erupted over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Vance's visit included touring a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center and a federal mobile command center, as well as delivering brief remarks. President Trump federalized troops from the California National Guard and deployed Marines to protect federal property in response to the protests, which have waned but the troops remain. Federal immigration officers have increased enforcement efforts, with ICE officers aiming for at least 3,000 arrests a day, though the daily average has been around 1,200. </p>

Temperatures are expected to peak on Saturday, with humidity increasing and some areas at risk of a "tropical night" where overnight temperatures do not drop below 20C.

          <p>President Trump said he will decide whether the U.S. will take military action in the growing Israel-Iran conflict "within two weeks," a timeline he has frequently used before. Over the years, Trump has promised action on policy issues from tax legislation to minimum wage increases to health care within this timeframe, often without these announcements materializing. Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary for President Joe Biden, called the two-week deadline "one of Donald Trump's absolute favorite tactics." While the world awaits Trump's decisions on geopolitical conflicts and global tariffs, history suggests these deadlines are often missed or delayed.</p>

          <p>Meta approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI about a potential takeover bid before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI. The two companies did not finalize a deal, with one person familiar with the talks saying it was "mutually dissolved," while another said Perplexity walked away. Meta's attempt to purchase Perplexity serves as the latest example of Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive push to bolster his company's AI efforts. Zuckerberg has grown agitated that rivals like OpenAI appear to be ahead in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing apps.</p>

          <p>A grand jury in Colorado has indicted Barry Morphew for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found more than three years after she went missing. Barry Morphew was previously charged with her murder in 2021, but those charges were dropped in April 2022 just before a trial was supposed to begin. Suzanne Morphew's body was found in September 2023 near the town of Moffat, and her death was determined to have been caused by homicide. Investigators uncovered a screenshot of a text message from Suzanne Morphew on her husband's phone stating she was done with their marriage.</p>
