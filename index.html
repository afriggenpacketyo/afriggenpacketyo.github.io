        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analyst forecasts but representing the slowest pace in a year. This growth was significantly tempered by a "rare and alarming" 0.5% contraction in fixed-asset investment over the first nine months, largely driven by a sustained decline in property investment. Experts suggest this weakness, particularly in the private sector, indicates a profound lack of confidence in the economy's growth trajectory and current government policies. Despite some positive indicators like increased industrial production, modest consumer spending and persistent deflationary pressures highlight the need for substantial policy support and structural reforms to fill the investment gap and stabilize the housing market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to significantly reduce U.S. assistance to Colombia and impose new tariffs on its exports, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to curb drug production. Trump labeled Petro an "illegal drug leader" and warned of aggressive U.S. action if Colombia does not comply. Petro strongly rejected these accusations, defending his country's efforts against narcotics and criticizing Trump's "rude and ignorant" remarks. This diplomatic escalation, following recent U.S. strikes on alleged drug vessels, threatens to undermine a crucial alliance in Latin America, raising concerns about increasing regional instability and the potential for further U.S. intervention.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a unique version of a protein, also found in humans, that is strongly linked to the exceptional longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this groundbreaking research provides a crucial molecular basis for how enhanced DNA repair mechanisms contribute to these rodents' remarkable lifespan, which can extend up to 37 years. The findings suggest that understanding and potentially leveraging this protein could inspire novel therapeutic anti-aging strategies. This discovery holds significant promise for improving human health and extending lifespan by targeting fundamental biological processes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service located a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area routinely used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. This discovery, described by the FBI, involved what appeared to be a hunting stand positioned high in a tree, found during a security sweep before Trump's arrival. While sources indicated the stand had likely been there for months and lacked a direct line of sight to the presidential movements, its presence prompted heightened security vigilance. The incident occurred in a region where an assassination attempt against the president took place last year, underscoring persistent security concerns.</p>

          <p>British soldiers are set to receive new powers to shoot down drones that pose threats to military bases, a measure to be unveiled by Defence Secretary John Healey. This "kinetic option" aims to enable faster and more decisive action against drone incursions, which have been reported at four British airbases used by US forces last year. The new capabilities, while initially restricted to military sites, could be expanded to civilian locations such as airports. This proactive policy initiative responds to recent drone disruptions across Europe and follows concerns over potential Russian involvement, signaling a significant enhancement of national security protocols.</p>

Despite facing a depleted defense, the 49ers effectively contained the Falcons' attack, limiting Bijan Robinson to just 40 rushing yards. This crucial win, achieved amidst ongoing injuries, improved the 49ers' record to 5-2, demonstrating their resilience and strong team dynamic in a challenging season.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it would resume enforcing the ceasefire in Gaza after conducting air strikes in response to what it termed a "blatant violation" by Hamas. These strikes, which hospital sources reported killed 44 people, were launched after Israel stated its troops were targeted by an anti-tank missile and gunfire in Rafah, killing two soldiers. Hamas denied knowledge of clashes in the Israeli-controlled area and accused Israel of its own violations, warning of a total collapse of the agreement. U.S. President Trump affirmed the ceasefire was still in place, suggesting "rebels within" Hamas might be responsible, while American envoys are expected in Israel to help maintain the fragile peace deal.</p>

          <p>Millions across India are celebrating Diwali, the significant Hindu festival of lights, marked by lamps, firecrackers, and festive gatherings. While the use of "green crackers" is permitted in Delhi this year to curb air pollution, their effectiveness remains debated, as previous bans were often flouted. The festival is also a time for preparing and sharing traditional sweets, decorating homes, and shopping for new clothes and gifts. Diwali's appeal extends beyond religious boundaries, drawing diverse communities together and providing a significant boost to the economy through widespread consumer activity.</p>

          <p>Hollywood actor Cate Blanchett has become an ambassador for Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB), highlighting the critical importance of seed conservation for plant diversity. The MSB, celebrating its 25th anniversary, houses over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species globally, stored at -20C. Initially a "doomsday vault," the collection is now actively used to restore threatened environments worldwide, including chalk grasslands and areas affected by wildfires in Australia. Blanchett emphasizes the "insurance policy" these seed banks provide against species extinction and environmental degradation, expressing personal regeneration from her involvement with the natural world.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers suffered a 38-24 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, largely due to Jonathan Taylor's dominant rushing performance, which included three touchdowns. Despite outgaining the Colts in total offense, the Chargers' defense struggled significantly, allowing Taylor to trample them with ease. Quarterback Justin Herbert threw three second-half touchdowns but faced constant pressure and two interceptions, highlighting the team's ongoing offensive line issues. This loss marks the Chargers' third in four games, pushing them out of the division's top spot and signaling a need for immediate improvements ahead of a short week.</p>

Elon Musk's companies, X and Tesla, have previously filed lawsuits in this division, known for judges appointed by Republicans.

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its seventh known strike since last month on an alleged drug-carrying vessel, resulting in three deaths, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced. Hegseth stated the strike, occurring in international waters, targeted a boat linked to a Colombian guerrilla group, the Ejército de Liberación Nacional, carrying "substantial amounts of narcotics." The Trump administration justifies these actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, claiming narcotics smuggling constitutes an "armed attack" on Americans. However, lawmakers, including Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, have questioned the legal and constitutional rationale for these strikes, calling the justification "very convoluted."</p>

The Palm Bay city council formally censured Langevin, and advocacy groups are urging Governor Ron DeSantis to suspend him, emphasizing that such hate speech legitimizes hostility towards minority communities.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Five Year Plan (2026-2030) is set to be decided by top leaders, continuing a policy tradition that has profoundly reshaped the global economy. Historically, these plans, like the 1981-84 "Reform and Opening Up," transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" of outsourced Western jobs. More recently, the 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, establishing China as a leader in EVs and renewables and giving it a near monopoly on rare earth supply chains. The current plan (2021-2025) emphasizes "high quality development" to challenge American technological dominance, sparking international diplomatic rows over national security.</p>
