          <p>Amidst escalating tensions, Pakistan has accused India of firing missiles at its air bases, prompting retaliatory attacks targeting Indian missile storage facilities and airbases. According to the Pakistani military, some Indian missiles landed in Afghanistan, while others struck within India's own Punjab region. India reported sightings of drones in multiple locations near the border, engaging them in response, as tensions soar following an attack in Kashmir that India blames on Pakistan, which Pakistan denies. The conflict has escalated with airstrikes and claims of downing fighter jets, raising concerns about regional stability between the two nuclear-armed rivals.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, utilizing drones and missiles in escalating attacks and counterattacks. The conflict began after militants killed 26 people in Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, an accusation Pakistan denies. The fighting has intensified, with both sides claiming to have inflicted damage on the other's military assets, leading to civilian casualties and widespread fear among residents near the border. Diplomatic pressure from international entities has so far failed to de-escalate the situation, with analysts fearing a risky move involving ground forces could lead to significantly more casualties.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft was stranded in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back ever since. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur and because the spacecraft was designed with a heat shield to survive Venus' atmosphere, there is a chance it will partially survive its return to earth, though the exact landing location remains unknown.</p>

The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels along the California coastline because biotoxins accumulate in shellfish during algae blooms, making them poisonous to humans. While commercial mussels are tested and safe to eat, officials advise caution with clams and scallops, recommending the removal of digestive organs before consumption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariff policy is impacting the port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, with traffic down by a third compared to last year. The decline is attributed to frozen trade between the U.S. and China, resulting in fewer ships, containers, and trucking jobs, causing financial strain for local workers. The shortage of certain items imported from China and price hikes are already taking hold, impacting businesses and consumers throughout the supply chain.</p>
