          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, his wife, Erika Kirk, is scheduled to deliver her first public address. The speech will be streamed live on Turning Point USA's social media channels, the organization her late husband founded. Kirk, a former Miss Arizona USA and podcaster, has been a frequent presence at her husband's public appearances. The address comes just days after the event that authorities have described as a political assassination, which also drew a statement of condolence from President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of Tyler Robinson for the assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk, a legal analyst is advocating for further investigation into potential co-conspirators. The analyst, Phil Holloway, points to the suspect's alleged Discord communications about acquiring a rifle as evidence that others may have been involved. He suggests that anyone who knowingly assisted or encouraged Robinson could face criminal liability, potentially through conspiracy or illegal firearm transfer charges. Utah officials have stated that no additional arrests are currently expected, but the analyst urges a deeper probe into the weapon's origins.</p>

          <p>In a touching story from Cincinnati, Ohio, a bride named Shacole Fox, who never knew her father, asked her 79-year-old landlord, Gil Pulliam, to walk her down the aisle. Fox, a makeup artist, rents a studio space from Pulliam and felt a painful void when considering who would give her away at her wedding. Sensing her situation, Pulliam offered to do the honor, an offer she enthusiastically accepted. Fox described the moment as feeling "like a wound had been healed in my heart," creating a powerful bond and adding a new father figure to her family on her wedding day.</p>

Tips from the students include remembering that everyone is nervous about making friends, not placing too much importance on freshers' week, and the practical value of doing dishes promptly to maintain good relations with flatmates. Other advice focuses on joining student societies to build community, planning ahead for commutes if living at home, and prioritizing mental health to avoid burnout from academic and social pressures.</p>

          <p>Officials have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The arrest was aided by Robinson's family, who recognized him from released photos and urged him to surrender. Investigators have recovered a high-powered rifle and bullet casings with inscribed, hyper-online messages, suggesting a complex motive. Authorities tracked the suspect's movements on campus via security footage and believe he acted alone, though the investigation into the "targeted attack" is ongoing.</p>

          <p>At least 193 people have been killed in two separate boat accidents this week in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Equateur province. In one incident, a boat carrying nearly 500 people capsized after catching fire on the Congo River, leaving 146 people missing. In another, a boat capsized on Wednesday, killing at least 86 people, most of whom were students. Such tragedies are common in Congo, where river transport is essential but vessels are often old, poorly maintained, and overloaded, with limited resources hindering rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk immediately triggered a toxic online response, where blame and conspiracy theories filled the information vacuum faster than facts could emerge. This article argues that the algorithmic internet incentivizes rage and rearranges information to fit preset narratives, rather than fostering understanding. The shooter's reported use of niche online memes and trollish phrases on bullet casings highlights a disturbing trend of nihilistic, performative violence designed for an online audience. This dynamic creates a poisonous environment where tragedy is exploited for engagement, and the potential for real-world violence continues to grow.</p>

While seeing the original cast reunite 40 years later provides some nostalgic enjoyment, the film's premise of the band being revered by real-life music legends removes the outsider tension that made the first film brilliant. The movie feels more like a collection of outtakes than a fresh comedic take, with recycled gags and undercooked comedic moments that fail to reach the heights of the original's satirical genius.</p>

The piece argues that Kirk's supporters see him as a martyr for a specific political-religious cause that equates right-wing ideology with Christian values. The author reflects on discussions with students who, while mourning the tragedy, question whether Kirk's legacy aligns with martyrdom, especially amid widespread, often overlooked gun violence.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has confirmed that Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi will continue to be excluded from the first-team squad indefinitely. The two players, who did not secure transfers away from the club during the recent window, are training separately from the main group, using a different pitch and facilities. Maresca stated he has not seen either player since the season began and that the plan is for this arrangement to continue. This confirms the duo's status in the so-called "bomb squad" as the club moves forward without them in their immediate plans.</p>

          <p>New documents have emerged in the controversy surrounding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who has been accused of mortgage fraud by the Trump administration. A loan estimate document reviewed by Reuters shows Cook declared her Atlanta property a "vacation home," which appears to counter allegations that she improperly claimed it as a primary residence simultaneously with her Michigan home. Real-estate experts suggest this document supports her defense. The situation is part of a broader conflict over the independence of the Federal Reserve, as Cook has sued to resist a presidential order for her dismissal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyer has denied that the pop star agreed to be deposed in the ongoing legal battle between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. This contradicts a statement from Baldoni's attorney, who claimed an agreement was in place for a late October deposition. Swift's legal team asserts she has "no material role" in the case and would only comply if compelled by the court. The dispute is the latest development in the dueling lawsuits between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars, with Lively's attorney accusing Baldoni's team of trying to create a "media spectacle" by involving Swift.</p>

          <p>A major cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has forced a worldwide production shutdown for nearly two weeks, creating a severe financial crisis for its network of suppliers. While JLR itself is expected to weather the multimillion-pound losses, many smaller and medium-sized businesses in its supply chain are reportedly at risk of bankruptcy due to the extended interruption. Experts and politicians are now calling for government intervention, such as a furlough scheme, to prevent widespread job losses among the up to 250,000 people employed in the JLR supply chain.</p>

In a recent interview, Benioff noted Palantir's impressive stock market valuation but described its software as "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen," suggesting Salesforce offers a more cost-effective alternative. The comments highlight the growing competition between the two companies, particularly for government contracts. Despite Salesforce being much larger by revenue, Palantir has a significantly higher market capitalization and faster growth rate.</p>

Investigators revealed that Robinson had become more political and had expressed dislike for Kirk's views. Evidence includes a recovered rifle and bullet casings with engraved messages, which are being analyzed as the investigation continues, with formal charges expected soon.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has canceled its plans for a fully electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing a slowdown in market demand for battery electric vehicles in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead of a full EV, the company will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which will be equipped with a gasoline engine that acts as a generator. This strategic shift reflects a broader reassessment of product strategy within Stellantis as the automotive industry navigates changing consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants and raised further doubts about the facility's capacity to handle large populations. Due to a disruption in an underwater pipeline, migrants were moved from the Migrant Operations Center to a higher-security area. Critics argue this incident highlights that Guantánamo's infrastructure is inadequate for the administration's goal of sending thousands of migrants there. The government has notified a federal court that water is not expected to be restored for at least another week.</p>

Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell's office argues that Kalshi's "events contracts" on sports outcomes are functionally sports wagers and must comply with state gaming laws. The state is seeking a court order to halt Kalshi's sports-related offerings in Massachusetts. Kalshi has previously maintained that its operations are federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, superseding state-level authority.</p>
