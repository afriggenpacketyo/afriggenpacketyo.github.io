        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Defense Minister Dong Jun, addressing a security conference, strongly criticized Western nations for perceived "bullying" and the formation of military alliances driven by "selfish interests." He urged countries to collaborate in defending the post-war international order and to resist "disguised hegemonic logic and bullying acts," a clear, albeit veiled, reference to the United States. These remarks found resonance with defense chiefs from Southeast Asia, who also voiced criticisms against unilateral actions, such as US tariffs, and called for greater efforts to advance multilateralism. The article highlights China's assertive diplomatic stance and its strategic push to strengthen regional alliances against what it views as Western dominance and protectionism.</p>

          <p>A new study, "Germans' greatest fears 2025," reveals that the rising cost of living continues to be the population's primary concern for the 15th time, despite an overall reduction in general fears. Germans are particularly worried about inflation, tax increases, welfare cuts, and unaffordable housing, which dominate their top anxieties. While the fear of being overwhelmed by refugees has decreased, concerns about authoritarian leaders globally, including the impact of a second Trump term, are on the rise. This article indicates a shift in focus towards immediate economic pressures and a continued dissatisfaction with political leadership, even as some long-standing anxieties lessen.</p>

          <p>England's full-back Ellie Kildunne is confirmed to return to the starting lineup for the Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final clash against France on Saturday, having successfully cleared medical checks following a concussion. The 26-year-old, a former World Player of the Year, is expected to significantly bolster England's back three with her renowned pace and attacking intent. Additionally, prop Hannah Botterman returns from injury, and Zoe Harrison will start at fly-half, favored for her game management over Holly Aitchison. This article outlines England's strategic team selections, emphasizing key player returns and their potential impact as the team aims for the final, with New Zealand and Canada contesting the other semi-final.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's independence is facing an unprecedented challenge as President Trump exerts pressure, highlighted by the controversial appointment of Stephen Miran to the board of governors. Miran, who previously expressed concerns about political influence on the Fed, joined the board hours before a key meeting and immediately voted for a deeper rate cut than his colleagues, aligning with the president's demands. This article details how Trump's efforts to influence monetary policy and remove specific governors are fueling concerns about the central bank's ability to operate without political interference. Despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assurances, the situation suggests a significant test for the institution's long-standing autonomy.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor has updated its full-year financial forecast for 2025, increasing revenue expectations but simultaneously lowering its anticipated operating profit margin, attributing the change to persistent U.S. tariffs. This revision precedes the company's inaugural CEO investor day held outside South Korea, and its first for CEO Jose Munoz. The automaker also reaffirmed its ambitious growth strategy, aiming to increase annual sales to 5.55 million units by 2030, a substantial 34% rise from last year's figures. The article points to a complex environment for Hyundai, with the investor event occurring shortly after a significant immigration raid at a jointly-owned battery plant in Georgia, which arrested hundreds of workers and strained U.S.-South Korea relations.

          <p>Beef prices have surged by 51% since early 2020, reaching historic highs due to a 75-year low in America's beef cattle herd, exacerbated by drought and reduced foreign imports. Ranchers face high operating costs, making it more profitable to sell young females for meat rather than breeding, slowing herd repopulation. This article highlights that while restaurants and stores are raising prices, consumers are finally showing resistance, with spending on ground beef plateauing for the first time in years.
