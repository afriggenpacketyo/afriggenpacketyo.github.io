          <h2>Democratic Congressman Calls for Party 'Rebirth' and Ousting of 'Old Guard'</h2>

          <p>California Representative Ro Khanna, speaking at a summit for young progressives, has called for a fundamental change within the Democratic Party, stating that the "old guard needs to go." He argued for a "rebirth" of the party to focus on the working class, human rights, and eliminating the influence of money in politics, citing the Jeffrey Epstein files as a starting point for a new era of transparency. Khanna's populist message contrasts with some party members who advocate for a more moderate direction as they navigate the post-2024 political landscape. The address highlights a growing debate within the party about its future leadership and core values.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her two children in Idaho, has been sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in Arizona. A judge found her guilty of conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019 and attempting to murder her niece's ex-husband. Prosecutors argued the motives were financial gain and her desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, underpinned by their distorted religious beliefs. During the emotional hearing, family members of the victims delivered powerful impact statements, condemning her actions and describing her as a destructive force.</p>

          <p>Data analytics and software firm Palantir has seen its market capitalization surge to $375 billion, making it one of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States. The company's stock has more than doubled in value during 2025, driven by strong investor optimism in its artificial intelligence ventures and significant growth in its U.S. government business. Despite its high valuation, Palantir's revenue remains smaller than other companies in the top 20, and its stock trades at a very high forward earnings multiple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's stock fell over 8% after the company announced it would cut costs and potentially discontinue its chip foundry business if it fails to secure a major customer for its next technology cycle. The announcement overshadowed a better-than-expected earnings report, highlighting deep concerns about the company's manufacturing turnaround strategy. The new CEO stated there would be "no more blank checks" for the division and is axing facility projects in Germany and Poland. This move reflects Intel's ongoing struggles to compete in the AI market and make its foundry venture profitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On his podcast, Joe Rogan condemned the American health insurance system, labeling it the "craziest gamble ever" where customers pay monthly with no guarantee of coverage when needed. He cited the case of former UFC fighter Ben Askren, whose insurer initially denied coverage for a necessary double lung transplant. Rogan and his guest argued that insurance companies are financially motivated to deny claims, describing the practice of making life-or-death decisions based on cost as "demonic behavior." The conversation highlighted a widespread public frustration with the perceived lack of ethics and accountability in the insurance industry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that the United States may not reach a new trade agreement with Canada, suggesting that imposing tariffs might be the alternative to negotiations. This statement comes after he set an August 1 deadline for a deal and follows comments from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney that his country would not accept a bad deal. The U.S. has already imposed significant tariffs on various Canadian goods, including steel, aluminum, and cars, as part of a broader strategy to renegotiate global trade relationships.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that while disruption is inevitable, efforts are being made to keep essential services running and urged patients to attend appointments unless canceled.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his administration is considering providing a rebate to some Americans, funded by the increased revenue from tariffs imposed on trade partners. He suggested a "little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice," while also mentioning that paying down the national debt is a major priority. Experts note that enacting such a rebate could be challenging without Congressional approval and might exacerbate inflation. The Treasury Department reported a surplus for June, bolstered by a significant increase in customs duties compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Giovanni Tortorici's debut feature, "Diciannove (Nineteen)," is a vibrant and stylistically messy film about a 19-year-old's tumultuous year of self-discovery. The movie follows Leonardo, an arrogant literature student in Siena, as he navigates intellectual pretension, loneliness, and the temptations of real life. Produced by Luca Guadagnino, the film shares a similar vivacity in its portrayal of youth, employing a wide array of cinematic techniques to capture the protagonist's chaotic inner world. While sometimes exhausting, the film is anchored by a compelling lead performance from Manfredi Marini, offering a witty and refreshingly untidy take on the coming-of-age genre.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell has completed a second day of meetings with U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who is investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case. According to her lawyer, Maxwell answered all questions truthfully and did not ask for anything in return, though she would "welcome any relief" from her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The Department of Justice has said it will share what it learned at an appropriate time. The high-profile meetings come amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to release all files related to the Epstein investigation, a pledge the president made during his campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coroner has concluded that there were failings in the mental healthcare provided to former England cricketer Graham Thorpe in the months before his death by suicide. The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive Thorpe to be in a crisis situation, even after being told he had asked his wife for help to end his life. Thorpe, 55, died after being struck by a train in August 2024, having spiraled into depression after losing his coaching job. The coroner noted shortcomings in his care but stated they did not amount to gross misconduct, highlighting a missed opportunity for in-person assessment.</p>

          <p>The number of U.S. troops at the southern border has tripled to 7,600 as part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, even as illegal crossing attempts have plummeted. A new military command center in Arizona now oversees operations in militarized zones where troops are authorized to apprehend migrants. This expansion of the military's role sidesteps the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement. Critics view the move as a norm-breaking, political strategy, while military leaders state their focus is on deterring crossings and supporting Border Patrol agents in high-traffic and remote areas.</p>

The letter, backed by MPs from nine parties including over half of Labour, argues that UK recognition would be a powerful step toward a two-state solution. This puts pressure on the government, especially after France announced its intention to recognize Palestine. In response, Starmer stated that recognition must be part of a broader, practical plan for peace and not a standalone gesture, a sentiment echoed in a joint statement with French and German leaders that focused on the immediate humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Marvel's latest film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," attempts to reboot the franchise with a vibrant, retro-futuristic aesthetic but struggles to find a sense of fun. The movie quickly moves past the team's origins and family dynamic, diving straight into a high-stakes plot where the planet-eating villain Galactus threatens Earth's immediate apocalypse. While visually handsome with a strong cast, the film's relentlessly grim and portentous tone flattens the characters and mutes their chemistry. The review argues that by focusing on end-of-the-world menace, the movie misses the playful banter and charm that defined the classic comic book source material.</p>
