          <p>As the artificial intelligence industry's demand for electricity surges, companies are exploring innovative energy solutions. In Nevada, a firm named Crusoe is using recycled electric vehicle batteries, supplied by Redwood Materials, to power its AI data centers with renewable energy. This approach addresses the power grid's strain and offers a sustainable alternative to building new gas-fired plants. The initiative, supported by a partnership with General Motors, aims to reuse batteries that have lost some capacity but are still highly effective for stationary energy storage.</p>

          <p>Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard has withdrawn its $47 billion acquisition offer for Seven & i Holdings, the Japanese parent company of 7-Eleven. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for retracting the bid. In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian firm's statements. The withdrawal follows a prolonged negotiation process where Seven & i had previously rejected offers, claiming they undervalued the company, leading to a halt in its stock trading.

          <p>A 49-year-old mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued after becoming stranded in a remote California forest. The pair got lost when their GPS led them onto backroads where they lost signal, but the mother's quick thinking to leave a series of handwritten notes guided rescuers to their location. The search was aided by a tip from other campers and the use of HAM radio by the rescue team when other communications failed. Officials praised the family for their survival instincts, including informing others of their travel plans.</p>

          <p>A recent Homeland Security raid on an Omaha meat processing facility, which resulted in the arrest of over 70 workers, has highlighted critical flaws in the federal E-Verify system. The business owner, who believed he was complying with the law by using the system, is now considered a victim alongside those whose identities were stolen. Experts argue that E-Verify primarily vets documents rather than people, making it easily fooled and contributing to identity theft. While USCIS defends the system's accuracy, critics call it a "wink-and-nod" program that allows politicians to appear tough on immigration without imposing major economic costs.</p>

The situation is exacerbated by the U.S. imposing a 25% "reciprocal tariff" and the lack of a breakthrough in trade negotiations.

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has stalled in the House of Representatives for a second consecutive day due to opposition from a bloc of conservative Republicans. Despite President Trump's intervention to secure votes, fresh objections to last-minute changes have prevented the legislation from moving forward. The stalemate highlights deep divisions within the Republican party on how to regulate the crypto industry and raises doubts about their ability to pass the measures. The ongoing delays are a significant setback for the crypto industry, which had hoped for legislative clarity during what was promoted as "Crypto Week." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In their first joint public comments on the matter, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have laughed off persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing on a podcast episode with Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson, the couple joked about the speculation that arose after Barack Obama attended several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama reiterated that she has been enjoying a new phase of personal freedom but affirmed the strength of their marriage. The couple, who married in 1992, used the platform to humorously and definitively put the rumors to rest.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for 694,271 Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs due to a defect that could cause a fuel injector to crack and leak fuel into the engine compartment, posing a significant fire risk. The recall affects certain 2021-2024 Bronco Sport and 2020-2022 Escape models equipped with 1.5L engines. As an interim measure, Ford dealers will provide a free software update to detect a leak and reduce engine power to prevent ignition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article from The Atlantic explores the political fallout from President Trump's reversal on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. After years of fueling conspiracy theories, Trump is now dismissing the issue as a "hoax," which has angered some of his most ardent supporters who he, in turn, is now lashing out against. The author argues this specific issue strikes at the core of Trump's political appeal: his promise to reveal truths that other politicians hide. The administration's contradictory behavior and Trump's personal history with Epstein have made the story uniquely damaging and difficult to control within his own coalition.</p>

          <p>A massive data breach by a UK official in 2022, which exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans seeking relocation, has been made public after a court injunction was lifted. The leak, which contained a spreadsheet of names and contact information, put individuals who had assisted British forces at risk from the Taliban. In response, the UK government secretly established a new relocation route, bringing thousands to safety, but did not inform them about the breach. The government has spent £400 million on the secret relocation plan so far, with total costs expected to rise significantly.</p>

          <p>A group of Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, has asked the UK's culture secretary to intervene in UEFA's decision to demote the Crystal Palace football club. After winning the FA Cup, the club qualified for the Europa League but was demoted to the lower-tier Conference League for breaching multi-club ownership rules. The issue stems from owner John Textor also owning French club Lyon, which also qualified for the same competition. The MPs described the punishment as "disgraceful" and "disproportionately punitive," raising questions about fairness in football governance.</p>

The author suggests the story's blend of known facts and genuine secrets makes it compelling to a wide audience, from QAnon followers to mainstream news consumers.

          <p>In the bankruptcy case of the New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese, investors are arguing that nearly half of the 633 clergy abuse claims could be thrown out on technical grounds. These arguments, if successful, could significantly alter a proposed settlement plan worth over $200 million. Many claims were filed after a court deadline or are considered duplicates, which could reduce the number of eligible claimants to 337. This would increase the average payout for remaining survivors but could also empower a bloc of victims opposing the deal to reject it entirely, potentially forcing the church out of bankruptcy.</p>
