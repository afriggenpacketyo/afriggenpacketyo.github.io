            <p>The Trump administration has presented its evidence against Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, alleging his involvement in antisemitic protests and activities. The case largely relies on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, claiming Khalil's presence in the U.S. would compromise foreign policy interests. Khalil's lawyers argue the evidence is insufficient and that the administration is attempting to silence him for his pro-Palestinian activism. The immigration judge will rule on whether Khalil can be deported or freed, while his lawyers also challenge his detention in federal court. </p>

            <p>The Northeast region has heavily invested in offshore wind energy, but the industry's future is uncertain under the Trump administration, which aims to halt its development. Cities like New London, Connecticut, are experiencing economic revitalization due to offshore wind projects, creating jobs and generating revenue. However, Trump has expressed strong opposition to offshore wind, raising concerns about potential delays, project cancellations, and the loss of tax credits. While some support Trump's stance, energy experts argue that offshore wind is crucial for meeting the Northeast's increasing electricity demands and climate goals.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's decision to pause tariffs for most countries, the remaining tariffs, especially on China, still pose a risk of inflation and recession. Experts predict that higher prices for widely used products will impact consumers, while policy uncertainty increases the likelihood of an economic downturn. Economists point to risks for businesses facing higher tax costs and a potential shopping slump as consumers curtail spending. The tariffs could push prices up by an additional 2.7% in 2025, costing consumers an average of $4,400 per household. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Meta whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, testified before senators that Facebook collaborated with the Chinese government to censor posts. She claimed Meta provided custom censorship tools to the Chinese Communist Party and allowed potential access to American users' data. Wynn-Williams also alleged that Meta's AI model was used to help a Chinese AI company. Meta has denied these claims, calling them divorced from reality. The testimony highlights growing concerns about the relationship between social media companies and the Chinese government.</p>

            <p>Scientists are finding prescription drugs, like anti-anxiety medications, in wastewater and discovering they alter the lives and behaviors of wildlife, particularly fish. Studies show that trace amounts of these drugs can affect fish behavior, making them bolder, less anxious, and less social. A recent study on Atlantic salmon found that salmon exposed to anti-anxiety medication were more likely to make it out to sea. While this seems beneficial, scientists warn that any changes to natural behavior can have negative consequences on the ecosystem.</p>

The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA based on third-quarter data for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Apple airlifted approximately 1.5 million iPhones from India to the U.S. to avoid potential price hikes due to President Trump's tariffs.

Apple chartered cargo flights to expedite the shipment, aiming to get its iPhones into the hands of U.S. customers before tariffs could lead to increased prices. </p>
