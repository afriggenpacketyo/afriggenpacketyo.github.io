          <p>Swiss running shoe company On is being sued in a class-action lawsuit filed in Oregon, alleging that its CloudTec shoe design causes an "embarrassing" squeaking sound with each step. Customers claim they would not have purchased the premium-priced shoes, ranging from $140-$180, had they known about the defect. The lawsuit seeks compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages for thousands of affected consumers, with the company allegedly dismissing the noise as "normal wear and tear."

          <p>China has warned the UK of "consequences" after London delayed the decision on its controversial mega-embassy application for a second time, pushing it to December 10. Beijing's foreign affairs ministry accused the UK of "politicizing the matter" and failing to honor commitments to improve relations. Downing Street denied any assurances, emphasizing national security concerns surrounding the proposed 20,000 square meter complex near the Tower of London, which opponents fear could compromise the UK's financial system. The article outlines escalating diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly criticized Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley for upholding the "blue slip" tradition, which allows home-state senators to block judicial and U.S. attorney nominees. Trump asserted that this "stupid and outdated" custom prevents highly respected Republican candidates from being confirmed, particularly in states with a single Democratic senator. Grassley, however, maintained that nominees lacking a blue slip do not have enough votes for confirmation. This article highlights a partisan conflict over Senate procedural rules and judicial appointments.</p>

It highlights expert concerns about extrajudicial killings and the potential for civilian casualties, drawing parallels to past US interventions. The article argues that such actions, if unchecked, threaten civil liberties and subvert constitutional processes, particularly Congress's war-making powers and the judiciary's role in justice.
