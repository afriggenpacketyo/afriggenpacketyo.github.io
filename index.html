          <p>A violent incident involving a shooting and a fire occurred at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulting in multiple victims. Law enforcement officials confirmed that the suspected shooter is "down" and no longer poses a threat to the public. Following the attack, the church building was reported to be actively on fire. Federal agencies, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, are responding to assist in the investigation of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against American Harris English due to a persistent neck injury. Consequently, the match was declared a half, awarding half a point to each team and adjusting the overall score to 12-5 in Europe's favor. Hovland's absence is a notable development, as Europe now requires only two more points from the remaining 11 matches to retain the Ryder Cup. This situation invoked the competition's injury protocol, known as the "envelope rule," for just the third time since its introduction.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN host Samantha Ponder described receiving "vicious" online messages after posting a tribute mourning the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. Speaking on Fox News, Ponder expressed concern that social media algorithms are creating "two different Americas" by showing users highly edited or biased content that fuels extreme division. She argued that many people who reacted negatively were being misled by skewed online portrayals of Kirk, leading to a situation where the murder of a father was celebrated by some. Ponder believes this phenomenon highlights a significant and dangerous problem with modern public discourse.</p>

          <p>The Danish government has ordered a temporary nationwide ban on all civilian drone flights following multiple sightings of unmanned aerial vehicles over military facilities. This measure comes after drone activity caused significant disruptions earlier in the week, including the temporary closure of Copenhagen's main airport. The ban will be in effect as Denmark prepares to host an EU leaders' summit and a meeting of the European Political Community. While officials have not definitively assigned blame, the incidents are being viewed as a potential "hybrid attack," with some leaders suggesting Russian involvement cannot be ruled out.</p>

          <p>Ty Cobb, who served as a White House special counsel during the Trump administration, strongly criticized the current Justice Department's actions, describing them as politically motivated and authoritarian. In an interview on "Face the Nation," Cobb argued that the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is unlikely to result in a conviction and may be dismissed. He asserted that Attorney General Pam Bondi has abandoned even-handedness to prosecute President Trump's political enemies.

          <p>A mass shooting at the American Fish Company, a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, left three people dead and at least five others injured. Authorities have arrested a suspect, Nigel Max Edge, who allegedly opened fire on patrons from a boat before fleeing the scene. The U.S. Coast Guard later apprehended him while he was at a public boat ramp on nearby Oak Island. Investigators believe the attack was "highly premeditated," and the suspect now faces multiple charges, including three counts of first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with high-ranking generals and admirals that was convened on short notice by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The gathering will take place at Quantico, and a source familiar with the plans confirmed the president's attendance. While meetings with senior military leaders are routine, the scale of this particular meeting, which calls for in-person attendance from officials worldwide, is considered unusual and potentially unprecedented. President Trump commented on the meeting, stating, "I love it," and dismissed any suggestions that there was something improper about it.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly voted in favor of a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% supporting the measure. This outcome was much tighter than polls had predicted and follows the rejection of a similar proposal in 2021 over privacy concerns. The revised system ensures that all data will be stored on individual users' smartphones and managed by the state, not private companies. Proponents argue the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential data misuse and privacy erosion.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a public health crisis as diabetes rates have nearly doubled in the last two decades, reaching 16.6% of the adult population, the highest in the European region. Public health experts attribute the dramatic increase to inadequate government food policies, sedentary lifestyles, and high consumption of carbohydrates and starch-based sugars. A significant number of cases remain undiagnosed, and many patients receive insufficient treatment, leading to high rates of hospitalization for uncontrolled diabetes. Critics are calling for systemic changes, including better preventative care, restrictions on unhealthy foods, and the implementation of free, healthy school meals.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has described Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, could lead to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people who are legally settled in the UK. Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer distinguished between removing illegal migrants and targeting those who are lawfully part of British society, arguing the latter would "rip this country apart." He suggested that Reform's supporters are not racist but are frustrated with years of Conservative government failures.</p>

          <p>A Florida family is left paying off a $17,000 loan for a Toyota RAV4 that was seized by the sheriff's office after it was discovered to be a stolen vehicle. The family had purchased the car for their 16-year-old daughter through a private sale, a transaction that carries significant risks compared to buying from a licensed dealership. Private sales are not subject to the same consumer protection laws, leaving buyers vulnerable to issues like outstanding liens, invalid titles, or stolen vehicles. Experts advise buyers to independently verify a vehicle's title with the DMV and run a comprehensive vehicle history report before purchasing.</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a British band from the 1960s, are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success. Their 1968 album "Odessey and Oracle," which was a commercial failure upon release, is now considered a rock classic. The band's hit song "Time of the Season" famously took a full year to climb the charts, long after the group had already disbanded due to financial struggles and a sense of stagnation. Now, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, reflecting on a long and unconventional path to musical immortality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid skepticism from figures like Donald Trump about official government statistics, alternative data sources are providing a more nuanced picture of inflation. Research firms and industry groups such as Truflation, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), and Adobe are using real-time data from online sales, supply chains, and small businesses to measure price changes. While some of these indexes, like Truflation's, show a lower inflation rate than the official Consumer Price Index (CPI), others, particularly from ISM, indicate that rising business costs could lead to future price hikes for consumers. These alternative metrics offer a different perspective but also highlight gathering inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is developing a new industrial manufacturing system to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of automobile production. This emerging "pull" system contrasts with the traditional aerospace "push" model, where components are made based on forecasts. In the new model, the final assembly line pulls components from suppliers only as they are needed, aiming to reduce delays, lower costs, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry.</p>

          <p>As more national chain stores close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to lease prime commercial real estate. Landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to move into spaces they were previously priced out of. While rental rates are not necessarily decreasing, their rate of growth has slowed, creating a more favorable environment for entrepreneurs.

This marks the third major settlement Dominion has secured from entities that promoted election lies, following substantial payouts from Fox News and Newsmax.

          <p>Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer turned critic, stunned an MSNBC panel by asserting his belief that former FBI Director James Comey will likely be found guilty of a crime. Countering the common pundit view that Comey's recent indictment is weak, Cohen claimed his own investigation revealed Comey's negative involvement in the Russia probe. Drawing from his own experience with what he called a "weaponized DOJ," Cohen argued that the government's access to a vast number of documents makes a conviction probable. The other panelists, including Molly Jong-Fast, expressed visible shock at his unexpected legal assessment.</p>

The report focuses on a group of women in Minnesota whose photos were used to generate sexualized images, revealing a legal loophole where no crime was committed because the images were not distributed. This has prompted a legislative effort in Minnesota to hold the tech companies that provide these services accountable.

The mission has faced criticism from Israeli authorities and recently experienced suspected drone attacks off the coasts of Tunisia and Crete.
