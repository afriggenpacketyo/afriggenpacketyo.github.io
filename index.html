          <p>Indiana Fever coach Stephanie White stated that Caitlin Clark's participation in the upcoming WNBA All-Star Game is uncertain following a groin injury. The team is prioritizing her long-term health and taking a cautious, day-to-day approach to her recovery. This injury is the latest in a series of physical issues for Clark, and the team has been slow in her return to play to ensure she is fully ready. The decision on her availability for the All-Star events, which she is slated to captain, has not yet been made, as the focus remains on her overall well-being.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Exports Decline for Second Consecutive Month Amid US Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:58:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of contraction and fueling concerns of a potential recession. The decline was driven by a significant 11.4% drop in exports to the United States, a key trading partner with whom a new trade deal remains elusive. The situation is exacerbated by an impending 25% U.S. reciprocal tariff set to take effect on August 1, targeting Japanese imports, including automobiles, which constitute a major portion of its exports. Analysts warn that these trade pressures could push Japan's export-reliant economy into a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mike Pence Calls for Release of Jeffrey Epstein Files, Contrasting with Trump's Stance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:58:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called for the Trump administration to release all government files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, emphasizing that the names of victims should be redacted to protect their privacy. Pence's statement directly contrasts with President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a politically motivated "hoax" started by Democrats. The former Vice President argued for transparency, noting that the investigation spanned multiple administrations and that the American people deserve to know the facts. This development highlights a significant division within the Republican party on the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's move to rescind $7.9 billion in foreign aid, citing "waste, fraud and abuse," is facing intense scrutiny over its lack of evidence. Former USAID Inspector General Paul Martin and other officials allege the claims are politically motivated and unsubstantiated, with program cuts based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than effectiveness. The administration's review process is described as a "surface level" search, leading to the termination of thousands of programs, including some providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance. Critics argue this approach undermines government transparency and accountability.</p>

Comey recently served as a prosecutor in the high-profile cases against Sean "Diddy" Combs and Jeffrey Epstein. Her dismissal occurs as the Justice Department appears to be investigating her father, who was fired by President Trump in 2017, adding a layer of political intrigue to the situation.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska was canceled after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast, initially prompting a more severe tsunami warning. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, led to precautionary evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. Officials later downgraded the alert, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected because the event happened in shallow water. The region, located along the seismically active "Ring of Fire," experienced several aftershocks but no major damage or inundation was reported, and the threat to populated areas like Anchorage was nonexistent.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has risen to £1,076 per child, according to new data from the charity Coram. Prices have increased significantly in some regions, driven by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs. Many working families struggle with these costs, particularly those on Universal Credit who must pay upfront before being reimbursed. The report also highlights a lack of available places for older children and those with special educational needs, placing immense financial and logistical strain on parents during the school holidays.</p>

The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed payments from insurance companies, which were then passed on to flat owners without their knowledge. As insurance costs have soared post-Grenfell, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allegedly allowing freeholders to profit from the crisis. The lawsuit seeks to recover these commissions, interest, and related taxes, with lawyers suggesting each flat owner could receive up to £2,000 in compensation.</p>

The note outlines several chaotic scenarios, including Powell suing to stop his removal and the potential for law enforcement to be involved in escorting him from the Fed. The ultimate decision on whether the president has the authority to fire a Fed chair for policy disagreements would likely fall to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Reversal on Epstein Files Risks Alienating His Core Supporters</h2>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic explores how President Trump's recent dismissal of the Jeffrey Epstein case as a "hoax" risks alienating his own base, which he had previously primed to believe in deep-state conspiracies. For years, Trump and his allies fueled interest in the Epstein case, promising to release files and expose powerful figures. Now, his administration's reversal and claim that no "client list" exists has caused a backlash among his most ardent supporters. This schism is unique because it challenges Trump's core political appeal as the truth-teller fighting a corrupt establishment, potentially creating a lasting rift.</p>

          <p>Shares of online firearm retailer GrabAGun, which counts Donald Trump Jr. as a board member and shareholder, fell more than 20% on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), raising $179 million in gross proceeds. The poor debut performance of the stock, trading under the ticker PEW, marks a rocky start for the conservative-aligned business venture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major data breach by the UK government, which exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had sought relocation, has been made public following a High Court ruling. The leak occurred in February 2022 when an official accidentally emailed a spreadsheet containing sensitive information, but it was suppressed by a super-injunction. The government then covertly created a new relocation route for those affected, bringing thousands to the UK without informing them of the breach. The revelation raises serious questions about government accountability, the financial cost of the secret operation, and the safety of those still in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>A group of Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, has formally requested that the UK's culture secretary intervene after the Crystal Palace football club was demoted from the Europa League. The club was moved to the lower-tier Conference League by UEFA for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also has a majority stake in French club Lyon, who also qualified. The MPs described the punishment as "disgraceful" and "disproportionately punitive," arguing it undermines the team's historic FA Cup victory and raises questions about fairness and transparency in European football governance.</p>

In 2002, he called Epstein a "terrific guy," but after Epstein's 2019 arrest, he claimed he "wasn't a fan" and had a falling out with him. On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump pledged to declassify the Epstein files, a promise that resonated with his base. Now in office, he has reversed course, dismissing the entire matter as a "Democratic hoax" and lashing out at his own supporters for their continued interest, creating a major political controversy for his administration.</p>

Trump has been a vocal critic of Powell, whom he nominated, for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. Dismissing a Fed chair would be a significant break from political precedent and raises concerns about the central bank's independence, a cornerstone of financial stability, as it navigates economic pressures from the administration's own tariff policies.
