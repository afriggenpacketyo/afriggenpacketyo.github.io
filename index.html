          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled by a beach umbrella pole during a gust of wind.

She remained remarkably calm throughout the ordeal as first responders used a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport to the hospital.

Despite these headwinds and a reported 86% drop in quarterly profits during its turnaround, the company's revenue and earnings surpassed Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to rise.

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first direct images of a potential exoplanet, a significant milestone for the observatory. The celestial body, named TWA 7b, is a gas giant estimated to be the mass of Saturn and orbits the young star TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, revealing the faint object. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet.</p>

          <p>Linda Sun, a former aide to New York governors, is facing new charges in a superseding indictment that accuses her and her husband of receiving $35 million in kickbacks. Prosecutors allege that during the early stages of the pandemic, Sun abused her official position to steer state contracts for personal protective equipment to her associates in exchange for a share of the profits. These new charges, which include wire fraud, bribery, and tax evasion, are in addition to a previous charge that she acted as an unregistered agent for China.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has charged two more former correctional officers, Jeffrey Wilson and Lawrence Gacad, with sexually abusing inmates at the now-closed Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California. This brings the total number of individuals charged in the scandal to ten, including guards, a chaplain, and the former warden. The facility was notoriously known as the 'rape club' by prisoners and staff due to the rampant sexual abuse. The new charges come after the federal government agreed to pay $116 million to over 100 women who were abused there.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial tax provision from President Trump's major spending bill at the request of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The provision, known as Section 899, would have allowed taxes on companies with foreign owners from countries deemed to have 'unfair' tax policies, a measure critics warned would cost U.S. jobs and investment. The removal follows an agreement Bessent reached with G7 countries on a global tax deal, but it complicates Republican efforts to find ways to offset the cost of the massive legislative package.

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have voiced doubts about the Trump administration's claim that strikes 'obliterated' Iran's nuclear program. Senators stated they believe significant capabilities and materials remain, and that the program was set back by months, not years, as the administration has asserted. They criticized the president for potentially misleading the public and raised concerns that the administration lacks a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, even as Republicans defended the mission's success.</p>
