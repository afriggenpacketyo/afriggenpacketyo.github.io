        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating a fatal plane crash near San Diego's Montgomery Field Airport, focusing on whether technical glitches and foggy conditions played a role. The Cessna 550 struck high-tension power lines before crashing into a residential neighborhood, killing all six aboard and injuring eight on the ground. The airport experienced two separate issues: an inoperative Automated Surface Observing Station and a lighting system issue on one of the runways. The pilot did not report any issues or declare an emergency before the crash, and the aircraft lacked a flight data recorder, complicating the investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meteorologists are expressing concerns that cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to National Weather Service (NWS) weather balloon sites are impacting forecasting accuracy. At least 13 balloon sites have been cut or reduced, leading to gaps in critical weather data, especially in areas like Northern Michigan, the Rocky Mountains, and Tornado Alley. Meteorologists emphasize that data from weather balloons, which measure air pressure and moisture, is irreplaceable by satellites or radar, particularly when cloud cover obscures satellite data. Former NWS leaders have warned that understaffing and program cuts could lead to needless loss of life due to inaccurate forecasts.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, was struck by a large-scale Russian missile and drone attack late Friday, causing explosions and machine gun fire throughout the city. This attack occurred hours after Russia and Ukraine conducted a significant prisoner exchange, the first phase of an agreement reached in Istanbul. The debris from intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts, resulting in injuries and fires. Despite the prisoner swap, battles continue along the front line, with neither country relenting in its deep strikes.</p>

          <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), resulting in staff reductions and reassignments, weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. Some NSC staff are being moved to other positions within the administration, while others are being placed on administrative leave. Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, and White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel are taking top roles as deputy national security advisers. These changes reflect a desire to streamline the NSC and ensure staff loyalty, though some former members express concern about reduced control of the bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss law firm, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn, are leaving to form their own firm following Paul Weiss's controversial decision to make a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting its business.

The decision to make a deal with Trump led to widespread criticism of Paul Weiss, with some associates, other firms, and Democrats decrying the firm's capitulation to the president.</p>

          <p>Following discussions with U.S. Cabinet members, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is increasingly acknowledging Japan's economic significance. Akazawa engaged in discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, focusing on trade, non-tariff barriers, and economic security. The two countries agreed to expedite trade negotiations, but it is unlikely that Japan will obtain substantial concessions. While Japan continues to advocate for the elimination of additional tariffs, the Trump administration appears steadfast in its tariff stance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted top investors of his cryptocurrency meme coin at the White House, following a gala event for holders of the $TRUMP coin. Despite White House claims that the gala was a personal event, several investors, including Chinese crypto mogul Justin Sun, were invited for a special VIP tour of the White House. This has drawn criticism, with some labeling the event as a "pay for play" scheme, where investors who poured money into Trump's crypto coin gained special access to the president, and the SEC asked a judge to put Mr. Sun's case on hold after Mr. Trump took office.</p>

Analysts cited uncertainty caused by the back-and-forth on trade as detrimental to global growth and markets.

This effort will involve approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), including Border Patrol agents and members of the agency's Office of Field Operations and Air and Marine Operations. The CBP personnel will support ICE's enforcement operations targeting immigrants in the country illegally, potentially beginning as early as next week.

          <p>President Trump's private dinner for cryptocurrency investors, which required the purchase of his $TRUMP memecoins, attracted a diverse group of individuals, including Chinese billionaire Justin Sun, who faces a lawsuit from U.S. regulators, and Elliot Berke, a lawyer for Justice Clarence Thomas. The event, held at Trump's Virginia golf club, granted special access to the president for those who invested heavily in his crypto venture. Invitees gained entry based on their holdings of the $TRUMP memecoin, with top investors receiving VIP status and a White House tour, raising ethical questions about leveraging the presidency for financial gain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ordered significant cuts to the White House National Security Council (NSC), dismissing numerous policy experts in a move to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication. The restructuring will leave the NSC at approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term, with many functions shifting back to their home departments and agencies. Trump is relying more on cabinet members like Secretary of State Marco Rubio for foreign policy decisions rather than recommendations from the NSC. This overhaul is designed to streamline the NSC and reduce the influence of those perceived as holdovers from previous administrations.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail is under scrutiny, as authorities credit the technology with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive. The New Orleans Police Department's partnership with Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating facial recognition cameras, has sparked controversy. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise constitutional and privacy concerns about the widespread use of live facial recognition, arguing that it poses a threat to fundamental rights and can be racially biased.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as the national security adviser, announced a major restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve officials from other agencies returning to their original offices and others being placed on administrative leave, effective immediately. The downsizing aligns with President Trumpâ€™s preference for top-down foreign policy decision-making, with advisers implementing his desired outcomes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States have adapted to human influence by evolving changes in the size and shape of their beaks due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to extract more nectar from feeders, and males' beaks have become pointier for fighting off competitors. This has also led to the expansion of the hummingbird's range northward as they followed the growing popularity of bird feeders. The study highlights how quickly evolution can occur in response to human-driven environmental changes.</p>
