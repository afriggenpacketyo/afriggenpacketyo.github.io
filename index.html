          <p>Actress Julia Roberts recently shared that she felt "scared" and "intimidated" before meeting her "After the Hunt" co-star, Chloë Sevigny. Roberts recounted the experience during a group interview, explaining that the anticipation of meeting Sevigny at her home for a rehearsal caused significant anxiety for herself, her daughter, and fellow actress Ayo Edebiri. Sevigny, however, expressed that she felt an immediate closeness to Roberts and deeply missed her after filming concluded, watching several of her movies on the plane ride home. The upcoming film deals with a college professor accused of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>This article provides a biographical overview of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was recently killed. It details his rise to prominence after founding Turning Point USA at age 18, his combative debate style on college campuses, and his close alliance with President Donald Trump. The piece also covers his controversial statements on race, religion, and social issues, which drew both a massive following and significant criticism. His widow, Erika Kirk, has since taken over as CEO of the organization, vowing to continue his mission.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has intensified its conflict with "sanctuary states," issuing letters that threaten legal action and funding cuts if they do not honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers. The letters target California, New York, and Illinois for laws that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agents. DHS officials argue these policies release unauthorized immigrants with criminal records into communities, while the states maintain that honoring the detainers, which are legally considered requests, could lead to liability and constitutional challenges. The Justice Department is expected to pursue lawsuits against the states.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested following a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. Police reported that at least three bullets were fired into the building's lobby on Friday afternoon, though no injuries occurred as the building was occupied at the time. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, and it is unclear if there is a connection to recent protests outside the station regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Media organizations have condemned the act as an unacceptable attack on journalists and the community.</p>

          <p>While deadly flash flooding in the Southwest has eased, forecasters warn that more monsoonal moisture could renew the threat in parts of California and Arizona. The recent floods proved fatal after a two-year-old was swept away in Barstow, California, highlighting the danger of even marginal flood risks, particularly in burn scar areas. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is expected to strengthen into the season's second hurricane.

          <p>Mary "Maggie" Cleary, a conservative lawyer, has been appointed as the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, an office currently investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James. The appointment follows the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, Erik Siebert, who was allegedly pressured by the Trump administration to bring charges against James, a frequent political opponent of the president. Cleary's appointment comes amidst accusations of political interference in the Justice Department, as the probe into James is seen by her supporters as retaliation for her own fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>An armed man was arrested at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the venue for the upcoming memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The 42-year-old suspect, Joshua Runkles, was taken into custody after exhibiting suspicious behavior and allegedly impersonating a law enforcement officer. The U.S. Secret Service, which is coordinating security for the high-profile event, confirmed that the individual was not authorized to be there and an investigation into his intent is ongoing.

          <p>A new stage adaptation at London's Rose Theatre transports Jane Austen's 1815 novel "Emma" into the modern world of Essex nightclubs and dating apps. Written by Ava Pickett, the play reimagines the clever and meddling heroine Emma Woodhouse as a university dropout navigating the complexities of her friends' online love lives. The adaptation explores contemporary themes like the toxicity of dating apps and the pressures of young adulthood, while retaining the core wit and social commentary of the original novel. This modern take joins a recent resurgence of interest in Austen's work across film and television.</p>

          <p>A BBC podcast details the story of Giulia Baccosi, who took a job as a cook on a cargo schooner in early 2020, only to become stranded at sea for over six months. Her three-month voyage from Europe to Central America was dramatically altered by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to port closures and travel shutdowns worldwide. Confined to the ship with a small crew, she faced dwindling supplies, rising tensions, and isolation from her family during a global crisis. The experience, which also included rescuing migrants off the African coast, profoundly changed her perspective on life.</p>

          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are working long hours in part-time jobs to afford their living expenses, as maintenance loans are insufficient to cover costs like rent and bills. According to recent studies, the maximum loan covers only about half of what is needed for a minimum standard of living, forcing students to juggle demanding work schedules with their studies. Some students report working up to 30 hours a week or commuting for hours from their family homes to save money. This financial pressure is causing them to miss out on academic and social opportunities.</p>

Scientists are now studying its effects on female biology, especially in relation to perimenopausal symptoms, where hormonal fluctuations can impact brain function. However, experts caution that research is still limited, and while the supplement is generally safe, its cognitive effects may be most noticeable in individuals under stress.</p>

The comments sparked outrage on social media, with many users pointing to Kirk's history of divisive rhetoric and criticizing Dolan's own record, including his handling of clergy sexual abuse cases.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of California San Diego have made a significant discovery by observing diamond capsules undergo shock-induced amorphization for the first time. Using powerful lasers, they were able to collapse the diamond's atomic structure under extreme pressure, a process crucial to understanding and controlling nuclear fusion. This breakthrough helps scientists better understand how to achieve the symmetrical implosion needed to release fusion energy, a clean and nearly limitless power source. The findings could accelerate research and bring the world closer to harnessing this transformative energy technology.</p>

          <p>California has become the first state to ban law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that hide their identities while on duty. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill as part of a package aimed at protecting immigrants amid aggressive federal enforcement operations directed by the Trump administration. The law, which has exceptions for tactical gear and medical masks, is a direct response to recent immigration raids where masked federal agents detained people in unmarked cars. While federal officials argue masks are necessary for officer safety, proponents say the law increases transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Tampa International Airport discovered a human skull and other bones inside a passenger's luggage during a routine check. The traveler, who was initially flagged for undeclared cigars and prohibited plants, claimed the remains were intended for ritual use. Officials noted that the transportation of human remains is strictly regulated by the CDC to prevent health risks, requiring specific documentation like a death certificate. The seized bones were ultimately destroyed by CBP, which highlighted the case as an example of the unpredictable items encountered during inspections.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has flown its first air defense mission over Poland as part of a NATO response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. RAF Typhoon jets, supported by a refueling aircraft, patrolled the skies to bolster the alliance's eastern flank and send a clear message that NATO airspace will be defended. The mission, dubbed "Eastern Sentry," was initiated after 19 Russian drones entered Poland on a single day, escalating tensions in the region. The action follows similar airspace violations by Russia in Romania and Estonia, prompting a unified allied response.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has denied that the Trump administration pressured ABC to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, despite public threats from the FCC Chairman. Leavitt claimed the decision was made solely by ABC executives because Kimmel "chose to knowingly lie" about the connection between Charlie Kirk's killer and the MAGA movement. Kimmel's show was pulled indefinitely after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk over the host's remarks. The suspension has drawn widespread criticism from free speech advocates and political figures.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is making a concerted effort to embrace patriotic symbols, such as the British flag, in a bid to reclaim them from nationalist and far-right groups. At the party's conference, former leader Tim Farron delivered a passionate speech urging members to stop being "squeamish" and wave the country's flags with pride. The move is a notable shift for the party, which has traditionally shied away from overt displays of nationalism. The new strategy aims to contrast the Lib Dems with parties like Reform UK, positioning themselves as true patriots.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that public statements by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and a highly publicized "perp walk" have fatally prejudiced the case against their client. The defense claims the decision to pursue capital punishment was political and has tainted the legal process, violating Mangione's constitutional rights. This move in federal court follows a recent victory in state court where terrorism charges against Mangione were dismissed.</p>
