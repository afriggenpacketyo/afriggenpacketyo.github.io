        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. electricity companies are finding it difficult to forecast the actual power demand that will result from the artificial intelligence boom, as tech firms shop the same large data center projects to multiple utilities. This creates uncertainty about how much new power generation is truly needed, potentially leading to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investments and higher consumer electricity bills. While experts agree that a historic increase in electricity consumption is coming, there is significant debate over its magnitude. The challenge lies in separating speculative projections from firm commitments to avoid overbuilding the grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton has pleaded not guilty to an 18-count indictment for the unlawful retention and dissemination of classified national defense information. The charges allege that Bolton shared thousands of pages of diary-like entries with relatives while serving in the administration and after his departure. This indictment follows recent charges against other prominent critics of President Trump, continuing what some observers describe as a campaign of political retribution. Bolton was released on his own recognizance but must surrender his passport and is restricted from international travel.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a sell-off after two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, reported issues with bad or fraudulent loans, sparking fears of instability in the banking sector. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index dropped, and major banks like Barclays saw their share prices fall, with similar downturns affecting European and Asian markets. The market turbulence has been linked to broader anxieties about poor risk management and the quality of deals in the private credit market. As a result, investors have moved towards safe-haven assets like gold, which reached a new record high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has filed a motion to dismiss his indictment or remove the death penalty as an option. His attorneys argue that President Donald Trump and the White House have made prejudicial public statements, including calling Mangione a "pure assassin," which they claim taints the potential jury pool. The filing contends that the administration is using the high-profile case as a political tool, blurring the lines of prosecutorial independence and jeopardizing Mangione's right to a fair trial.</p>

          <p>The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee has warned that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the agency responsible for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, is on the verge of furloughing 80% of its employees. This is due to the ongoing government shutdown, as the agency's carry-over funding is nearly depleted. The potential staff reductions have raised significant national security concerns about the management and safety of the nation's most critical strategic assets. The shutdown, now in its 17th day, continues without a clear resolution between Republicans and Democrats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, President Donald Trump's approval rating on his handling of the economy has dropped to a net negative of -13, the lowest of his presidency. The decline is attributed to growing public concern over inflation, job security, and the ongoing government shutdown. A majority of respondents, 53%, blame the president and congressional Republicans for the potential economic harm caused by the shutdown. The survey indicates that independents, a key voter demographic, are leaning substantially negative on the president's economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark international agreement designed to reduce carbon emissions from the global shipping industry has been abandoned after facing decisive opposition from the United States and Saudi Arabia. President Trump publicly condemned the plan as a "green scam" and his administration reportedly threatened tariffs against countries that supported it. During final negotiations in London, a Saudi-led motion to adjourn the talks for a year successfully passed, effectively derailing the treaty's carefully planned timeline. This collapse is a major setback for climate action, as shipping accounts for 3% of global emissions.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of wage garnishment, a legal process creditors can use to collect on unpaid credit card debt after securing a court judgment. Federal law limits the amount that can be garnished to the lesser of 25% of a person's disposable income or the amount by which their weekly earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. However, many states have stricter rules that offer more protection for borrowers. The article also outlines several debt relief strategies, such as negotiation and debt management plans, that can help consumers avoid this severe consequence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a case that has captivated France, a court has convicted Cédric Jubillar of murdering his wife, Delphine, and sentenced him to 30 years in prison, despite the fact that her body has never been found. The prosecution built its case entirely on circumstantial evidence, including the couple's deteriorating relationship, her plan to divorce him for another man, and screams heard by a neighbor on the night she disappeared in December 2020. Jubillar maintained his innocence throughout the trial, and his lawyers, who argued the evidence was speculative, have announced they will appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>During the murder trial of Deng Majek, an asylum seeker accused of killing 27-year-old hotel worker Rhiannon Whyte, jurors were shown disturbing mobile phone footage. The video allegedly shows Majek dancing in a hotel car park, with an ambulance visible in the background, less than 90 minutes after Whyte was fatally stabbed 23 times with a screwdriver at a nearby railway station. Prosecutors contend that Majek followed Whyte from the hotel where he was housed, attacked her on the platform, and then went to buy alcohol before returning to the scene.</p>

          <p>This article outlines a series of recent federal indictments and investigations targeting high-profile political adversaries of President Donald Trump, a pattern critics have labeled a "retribution campaign." Among those targeted are former National Security Adviser John Bolton, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former FBI Director James Comey, who face charges ranging from mishandling classified documents to bank fraud. These actions have intensified concerns that the Department of Justice is being weaponized for political purposes to punish the president's perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen federal funding for two of New York City's most critical infrastructure projects: the Gateway rail tunnel under the Hudson River and the Second Avenue Subway extension. The decision is widely interpreted as a political maneuver to exert pressure on New York's Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries. By imposing an unusually burdensome regulatory review on projects already in progress, the administration has created a precedent that could be used to stall development and undermine infrastructure initiatives across the country.</p>
