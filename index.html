          <p>Several news outlets are covering a range of topics, including concerns over government spending cuts, with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner reportedly clashing with other officials over budget reductions. The postponement of the government's child poverty strategy raises concerns about increasing poverty rates. On a positive note, plans are underway to establish a network of mental health A&Es across the UK to alleviate pressure on hospitals. Internationally, President Trump's threats to increase EU tariffs are causing economic anxiety, particularly in Germany, while the brother of the Princess of Wales shares insights into their special bond and mental health struggles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered a commencement address to West Point graduates, his first since returning to office, emphasizing the importance of remembering soldiers who fought in the war over slavery. He also paid tribute to the academy's history and its famed graduates. Vice President JD Vance spoke at the U.S. Naval Academy, stating that Trump aims to ensure soldiers are deployed with clear objectives, contrasting with past "undefined missions." This address follows Trump's recent commencement speech at the University of Alabama, which combined standard advice with political attacks on his predecessor. </p>

          <p>A knife attack at Hamburg's main railway station resulted in eighteen injuries, with some victims sustaining life-threatening wounds. Police arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene and believe she acted alone, possibly due to mental distress. The attack occurred between platforms 13 and 14, accessible via a busy main road, and the homicide division is investigating the incident and the suspect's motives. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed shock and thanked the emergency services for their swift response.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate consumer burden from soaring rice prices. The move comes amid criticism that the government has not effectively curbed the price spike, which has hurt households amid rising inflation. Koizumi intends to bypass auctions to control prices and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution, with procedures for negotiated contracts expected to begin soon. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons initially. (not investment advice)</p>

This endorsement follows a review by federal agencies and signals a reversal from previous concerns about national security risks. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to American workers and the steel industry. The acquisition, initially announced in December 2023, had faced opposition due to national security concerns and political considerations, including opposition from President Biden and the United Steelworkers union.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's approach to confronting its Nazi past is under scrutiny, particularly concerning the legacy of individuals and families who profited from Nazi collaboration. Despite widespread education about the Holocaust and the rise of far-right movements, some wealthy families, like the Quandts (major shareholders of BMW), have avoided full accountability for their Nazi-era crimes. This is exemplified by the Herbert Quandt Media Prize, awarded to journalists, effectively whitewashing the legacy of an early SS supporter. The author argues that Germany's remembrance culture is selective, embraced when it enhances its self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests.</p>

The trend reflects a broader shift as countries and businesses seek alternatives to the US dollar due to trade wars, aligning with China's long-term strategy for financial independence.

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the manhunt for escaped New Orleans inmates has ignited controversy. Despite the police department's recent pause on automated alerts from the group, its cameras aided in recapturing one fugitive. Critics, including the ACLU, raise concerns about privacy and constitutional rights, calling for a halt to live-feed facial recognition. The technology, which scans faces, clothing, and license plates, has also drawn bipartisan opposition from members of Congress, citing potential biases and misuse.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., causing two commercial jets to abort their landings. The incident occurred on May 1, with the loss of contact attributed to a temporary antenna malfunction. Federal air traffic controllers also had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's location, leading to confusion and the go-arounds. The Army stated there were no deviations from the approved flight path and no risk to air traffic, but the event has raised concerns about air safety following a deadly midair collision earlier this year. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media rather than directly to the agency.</p>

          <p>Laura Piani's debut feature, "Jane Austen Wrecked My Life," is a warm romance about Agathe, a bookish clerk in Paris who dreams of a Darcy-like love. Agathe is sent to the Jane Austen Residency, where she meets Oliver, Austen's great-great-great-great-grandnephew, with whom she initially clashes. The film explores themes of literature, writing, and poetry, as Agathe confronts past traumas and writer's block, ultimately finding love and self-discovery. The movie's predictable yet enjoyable journey offers a salve-like quality for romantic souls, suggesting that Jane Austen didn't wreck her life, but rather opened it up to possibilities.</p>

Concerns range from forgetting to recharge devices to disliking the taste of refillable vapes, which often contain fewer sweeteners. While the ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, some worry it will drive people back to smoking cigarettes. Retailers have seen a surge in vape sales as customers stock up, but some small shop owners fear the ban will negatively impact their businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance, following another round of trade talks. Akazawa held frank discussions with U.S. officials, emphasizing trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. He reiterated Japan's call for the removal of additional tariffs and noted that economic security issues are crucial. The discussions took place amid Trump's endorsement of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, suggesting a positive development in bilateral relations. Both countries aim for a mutually beneficial deal, potentially during a meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump in June.</p>

The agreement followed President Trump's targeting of the firm for employing individuals who had investigated him, leading to concerns about political interference in the legal community. While it is unclear if the departures are directly related to the deal, the situation has sparked debate within the legal profession.
