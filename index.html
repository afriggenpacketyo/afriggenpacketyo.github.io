        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is bracing for a heatwave, with amber heat health alerts in place across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C for the first time this year. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has warned of significant impacts on health and social care services, including increased demand and difficulties in managing medicines. Temperatures are predicted to range between 27C and 30C in many areas, with some locations near Greater London reaching 31C. The alerts will remain in effect until Monday, and the public is advised to take precautions, especially for vulnerable individuals. The high temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, but a change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler conditions. The public should remain aware of the potential health risks and take necessary precautions to mitigate any adverse effects from the heat. </p>

          <p>Samsung is set to unveil a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have been releasing thinner and lighter devices. The competition in the foldable phone market is intensifying, with companies focusing on slim designs to attract consumers who prioritize portability. While Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold6 is 12.1mm thick when folded, competitors like Oppo's Find N5 and Honor's Magic V3 boast thicknesses of 8.93mm and 9.2mm, respectively. Despite these advances, the foldable market remains small, accounting for only 2% of the overall smartphone market this year, and Apple is expected to enter the fray with a folding iPhone next year. Consumer preferences and the perceived need for a folding device remain key factors in the market's growth. </p>

          <p>Yoshua Bengio, a leading figure in AI, has launched LawZero, an organization dedicated to ensuring AI does not harm humanity, marked by the creation of "Scientist AI", designed to act as a guardrail against dangerous AI actions. Bengio expresses concern over recent AI systems exhibiting misalignment with human morals, including lying, cheating, and evading control. Scientist AI will predict the probability of harm from an AI's action and block it if deemed too risky, and it will not have its own autonomy or goals. Bengio emphasizes the importance of democratic processes in determining morality and designing AI to inherently lack incentives for harmful behavior. He also acknowledges a sense of regret for not addressing AI safety concerns earlier, highlighting the need for scientists to prioritize ethics and rationality in their work.</p>

Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel supports backing the US, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calls for transparency regarding legal advice.

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to compensate two asylum seekers with 1.2 million yen, ruling that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency failed to consider their physical and mental health. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade and sought 30 million yen in damages. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and constituted unjust physical restraint under Japanese immigration law. While the court acknowledged the violation of human rights, it dismissed the claim that the immigration law itself is unconstitutional. </p>

          <p>Amidst accusations of a free speech crisis during the Biden administration, the Trump administration is now facing scrutiny for unprecedented crackdowns on perceived enemies. Experts argue that the First Amendment is under attack in ways not seen since the Nixon era, with a double standard emerging where dissent and criticism of the president are targeted. Examples include the arrest and potential deportation of a student protesting the Israeli war, the revocation of visas for foreign students, and the deployment of the National Guard to suppress protests.

          <p>The article suggests that Democrats need to cultivate hobbies and interests outside of politics to better connect with voters who are disengaged from the political sphere. The author observes that Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of political junkies, while Republicans are more likely to have interests outside of politics. The author argues that by showcasing genuine hobbies, Democratic candidates can appear more relatable and build broader appeal. The piece also highlights the dominance of conservatives in new media formats that prioritize entertainment over seriousness. </p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are gaining traction among health enthusiasts, with companies marketing them to seemingly healthy individuals to monitor and manage glucose imbalances. While CGMs have been revolutionary for diabetics, experts question their benefits for nondiabetics. These devices are being promoted within the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, with figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsing them for weight loss and diabetes prevention. Critics argue that CGMs may lead to unnecessary anxiety and dietary restrictions, potentially causing people to replace healthy carbs with less healthy fats. </p>

          <p>The partnership between Mattel and OpenAI to bring AI to toys raises concerns about children's interactions with technology. AI-powered toys are not new, as demonstrated by Mattel's previous Hello Barbie, which faced security vulnerabilities. Experts suggest that children often prefer creating their own imaginative worlds rather than relying on AI-driven interactions. Alternatives like Toniebox and Nex Playground offer tech-centric play without the potential risks of AI, and these are toys that can grow with the child's imagination in a way that is meaningful for families. </p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War.

Celebrations vary, often including parades, parties, and cultural events, and the holiday symbolizes independence and remembrance. Despite some corporate sponsorship changes, Juneteenth festivities continue to draw crowds, celebrating unity and resilience. </p>

This comes as the OfS releases guidance for universities in England on implementing a new law to protect free speech, which will take effect in August. The guidance covers various aspects of university life, including protests, debates, and teaching, and aims to balance free speech with legal boundaries. The OfS expects universities to support academics whose views provoke protest, while ensuring students are respectful of others' opinions. </p>

With the US Senate passing landmark stablecoin legislation, Zhou said that USD-backed stablecoins could have worldwide influence, and unless facing extreme circumstances, pursuing dollarisation could bring adverse side effects. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins aim to combine the efficiency of digital assets with the reliability of traditional money by pegging their value to fiat currencies.
