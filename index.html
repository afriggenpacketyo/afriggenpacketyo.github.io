          <h2>China's Export Growth Defies US Tariffs, Fueled by Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:22:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a surprising surge in April, growing by 8.1% despite the imposition of tariffs by the United States. This growth was largely driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. President of Pinpoint Asset Management Zhiwei Zhang suggests this resilience may be due to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts, but anticipates a gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months. The Chinese government has been encouraging exporters to focus on the domestic market to mitigate the impact of tariffs, a move that could potentially lead to deflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by news of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK, hailed as 'historic' by both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump. While the deal aims to alleviate some tariffs imposed by the US, a 10% levy on most goods remains, causing some to view the agreement as limited in scope. The Daily Telegraph reports that the deal includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim the government dismisses. The papers also reflect on commemorations for the 80th anniversary of VE Day and the selection of a new Pope, Leo XIV.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece discusses the United States' renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by strategic and geopolitical considerations. Greenland's location is crucial due to its proximity to both Russia and the European heartlands, making it significant in the nuclear age and for monitoring international transport routes. The Arctic is warming rapidly, granting Russia easier access to open waters, which Russia has been quick to exploit, including extensive energy and mineral resources. The author suggests a resolution to tensions within NATO by applying the "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, to ensure NATO security interests while moderating concerns among international partners.</p>

          <p>Russia is set to hold a grand Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, with leaders from over 20 countries in attendance.

President Zelensky of Ukraine has rejected a proposed Russian ceasefire, calling it a "theatrical show." The parade will feature thousands of soldiers, armored vehicles, and a regiment of Chinese soldiers, symbolizing Russia’s shift in alliances and its historical narrative.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's skepticism towards offshore wind power is causing uncertainty and reassessment within the renewable energy industry. A halt to the Empire Wind project off Long Island has shocked companies like Welcon in Denmark, which was set to build turbine towers for the project. While the European wind industry remains optimistic, executives are wary of the US market's future under the current administration. Orsted, a global wind developer, reported positive first-quarter results but decided not to proceed with a large wind facility in Britain due to rising prices and uncertainty, underscoring the difficult economic and regulatory environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is rapidly processing white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, for refugee status, citing racial persecution, while simultaneously halting almost all other refugee admissions. Government officials are planning an event to welcome the first group of Afrikaners arriving in the U.S. The rapid processing contrasts sharply with the typical years-long wait for refugees from other regions. Advocates for refugees criticize the administration's inaction on other cases, even in the face of court orders. The administration will rely on the Department of Health and Human Services to assist the Afrikaners with housing, furnishings, and essential supplies.</p>

The defense lawyer questioned the sergeant about securing the house as a potential crime scene and whether key witnesses could have lied about O'Keefe entering the house. The investigation recovered a broken glass and O'Keefe's missing sneaker from the scene, supporting the theory that he had been struck by a motor vehicle.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that US tariffs on goods from China may decrease as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. Trump referred to the current tariff level of 145%, indicating it is likely to be reduced. China has also expressed confidence in managing trade issues with the US. Analysts caution that these talks mark the beginning of potentially lengthy negotiations and that any initial tariff cuts are likely to be minor. The announcement of these talks has been welcomed as a positive step towards easing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A pro-Palestinian rally at Brooklyn College resulted in physical altercations and arrests as demonstrators clashed with police. The unrest occurred after similar arrests at Columbia University, reflecting pressure on colleges to quell pro-Palestinian campus unrest. The chaos began as demonstrators exited the college gates and paused in front of the Tanger Hillel House. Police aggressively moved in to make arrests, leading to physical altercations and the use of a Taser. College officials stated that demonstrators violated college policy by setting up tents.</p>

          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have not boosted its stock market due to concerns over economic deterioration and ongoing trade tensions with the US. The stimulus, intended to revive growth, was largely priced in by markets and is seen as a stopgap rather than a comprehensive solution. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector. The central government acknowledged the impact of external shocks, but the stimulus is more focused on industrial and social needs.</p>
