          <p>An off-duty police officer working security and a civilian were shot outside an office building at 345 Park Ave. in Midtown Manhattan. The suspect, armed with a long gun, fled into the building and was later found dead on the 33rd floor from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The building, which houses Blackstone and the NFL headquarters, was placed on lockdown as authorities investigated the motive for the attack. The wounded officer's and civilian's conditions were not immediately known following the incident.</p>

          <p>Veteran defensive lineman Christian Wilkins was reportedly involved in an incident where he attempted to kiss a teammate on the forehead, which caused offense and led to a human resources complaint. According to reports, this event, described by one source as "playful," was not the sole reason for his release from the Las Vegas Raiders. The team is also reportedly voiding the remaining $35.2 million in guaranteed money on his contract due to his handling of rehabilitation for a Jones fracture. Wilkins has since filed a grievance through the NFL Players Association to contest the team's decision.</p>

The man suspected of the killings, 43-year-old Ian Rutledge, died in the hospital from what police believe was an attempted suicide. The community has held vigils to honor the victims, who were remembered for their vibrant lives rather than the violent nature of their deaths. Funeral services will be held in both Maguiresbridge and their mother's hometown, with attendees asked to wear bright colors in their memory.</p>

The lottery is free to enter, and unsuccessful applicants will receive points to improve their chances in future drawings.

          <p>A court in Bogota has convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of witness tampering and bribery, a landmark ruling that marks the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal case. Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, was found to have pressured a jailed ex-paramilitary not to testify about his alleged links to illegal right-wing armed groups. The highly politicized case, which could result in a sentence of up to 12 years, stems from a 2012 accusation Uribe himself made against a left-wing senator. The verdict has been condemned by some U.S. politicians as a "weaponization" of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by an investment fund that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The fund, Azoria Capital, argued the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should be subject to federal "Sunshine Act" open meeting laws, but the judge upheld its long-standing practice of meeting privately. During the hearing, the judge questioned whether the lawsuit, filed by an ally of President Trump, was a publicity stunt for the new fund, which claimed the Fed was keeping rates high to undermine the president's agenda.

          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the January wildfires caused $51.7 billion in damage to residential properties within Los Angeles city limits. The analysis focused on the roughly 11,000 homes inspected by the city after the blazes, primarily the 23,000-acre Palisades fire, which destroyed many high-value homes in wealthy neighborhoods. The report does not include commercial properties or public infrastructure, which suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in additional damage. This figure is part of a larger estimated economic loss from the fires that could range up to $275 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly disagreed with the Israeli government's assertion that there is "no starvation in Gaza," stating that images he has seen on television show "real starvation stuff." This divergence comes as Israel faces mounting international pressure over the humanitarian crisis, with some human rights groups now characterizing the situation as a genocide. An Israeli military spokesman dismissed the images as "fake" and distributed by Hamas, a claim the Israeli government supports but which Trump rejected. The president indicated the U.S. would increase aid efforts and is speaking with Prime Minister Netanyahu about finding a "different way" to end the war.</p>

          <p>An inquest has heard that a 23-year-old woman who died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma had previously told a court she was "anti-vax" and refused chemotherapy. The woman, Paloma Shemirani, instead opted for an unproven alternative treatment called Gerson therapy, which involves a strict diet and enemas. She had denied her cancer diagnosis, calling it an "absurd fantasy," and feared that chemotherapy could cause infertility. Her mother, a former nurse who was struck off for sharing conspiracy theories, has blamed doctors for her daughter's death, which was caused by a fatal heart attack resulting from her tumor.</p>

          <p>China’s civil aviation authority is surveying the country's airlines about their future fleet needs, specifically asking about potential orders for Boeing aircraft. This move suggests that aircraft purchases could become a positive area in U.S.-China trade relations if a broader agreement is reached between the two nations. Boeing has often been caught in the crossfire of bilateral tensions, but industry insiders believe the American manufacturer is well-positioned to benefit from any thaw. The survey follows a recent meeting between the head of the aviation administration and a senior Boeing executive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking to flee Gaza has won a significant legal victory in the UK, as the High Court ruled the foreign secretary must "think again" about helping them leave. The family of six, who have a British relative and were granted permission to come to the UK in January, have been unable to leave Gaza to complete the necessary biometric checks. The Foreign Office had refused to ask Israel to permit their exit, citing a narrow policy, but the judge ruled the government must reconsider given the family's "constant risk of injury or death."</p>

While many capitals acknowledged the deal was necessary to avoid a full-blown trade war with higher tariffs, there was little celebration.
