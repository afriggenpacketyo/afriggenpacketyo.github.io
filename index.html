          <p>Following former President Trump's threats to impose a 10% tariff on BRICS nations, Brazil and India have announced a plan to triple their bilateral trade. Trump described the economic bloc, which includes major emerging economies, as a group set up to harm the U.S. and devalue the dollar. This move by Brazil and India signals a unified front among some Global South nations to counter potential U.S. economic pressure and strengthen their own trade relationships. The BRICS group has expanded and seeks to reform Western-dominated international institutions.</p>

          <p>New before-and-after satellite photos are providing a stark visual record of the deadly flooding in Central Texas. The images highlight the catastrophic impact on areas like Camp Mystic and the Ingram Dam along the Guadalupe River. With over 100 fatalities and more than 160 people still missing, the images show washed-out structures, debris fields, and the dramatic rise of the river. These visuals help to quantify the immense scale of the natural disaster that struck the region over the July Fourth weekend.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 21:56:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) dropped by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking its most significant fall in almost two years and deepening deflationary concerns. This decline, worse than anticipated, reflects an intensifying price war among companies as they struggle with weak consumer demand. While consumer prices showed a slight 0.1% increase, economists warn that without strong government stimulus, the economy may struggle to escape a deflationary spiral. The data points to significant economic headwinds for China, exacerbated by external pressures like U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A flash flood emergency has been declared in Lincoln County, New Mexico, after heavy rains caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise 15 feet in just one hour. Multiple rescue operations are underway, including for a father and two children who were reportedly washed away in the floodwaters. The rapid and extreme flooding, which may have set a record for the river's height, is exacerbated by burn scars from wildfires last year that have made the soil more prone to runoff. Authorities are urging residents to seek higher ground as the situation develops.</p>

The piece suggests that the "America first" mentality is creating a vacuum in soft power and international cooperation.

          <p>A 22-year-old Tesla driver in San Diego County is facing a murder charge for allegedly intentionally ramming his car into a motorcyclist on the I-805 freeway, killing him. Prosecutors allege Ulysses Jiminez was speeding in the carpool lane when he deliberately struck 53-year-old Jorge Uribe from behind. After the fatal collision, the Tesla also hit a pickup truck, injuring its six occupants, before Jiminez reportedly fled the scene on foot. He has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges and could face life in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas has renewed focus on the Trump administration's staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. While experts generally agree that the NWS issued timely warnings for this specific event, they caution that continued reductions could compromise the agency's ability to forecast future disasters. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, and some regional offices are operating with significant meteorologist vacancy rates. Critics argue these cuts threaten the research and operational capacity needed to protect lives from severe weather.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind power capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will add at least 9 GW this year, accounting for more than half of all new global capacity. This surge is driven by strong central government support and is part of a broader strategy to promote the country's "marine economy." The expansion highlights China's growing dominance in the renewable energy sector as it develops technology for deep-sea wind farm construction.</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended fundamental reforms to the UK's criminal justice system, including the use of judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposal aims to tackle a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases, which is causing long delays for victims and defendants. Other recommendations include handling less serious offenses with a panel of a judge and two magistrates. While supporters believe the changes are needed to prevent a "total system collapse," some legal professionals argue that removing juries undermines a fundamental right.</p>

          <p>The conviction of Sean "Diddy" Combs has highlighted the persistent challenges in holding powerful men in the hip-hop industry accountable for sexual misconduct. This article explores why the genre has not experienced a full-fledged "MeToo" movement like Hollywood, pointing to a culture of silence reinforced by non-disclosure agreements and financial dependency. Experts also cite the compounding factors of racism and misogyny, and a "black protectionism" phenomenon where successful Black figures are shielded from scrutiny. A true cultural reset is needed to dismantle the systems that protect predators.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss medication. In the post, Collins credited her weight loss to a service called Yazen, which provides prescription drugs alongside a lifestyle app. The ASA ruled that even without naming a specific drug, the advert breached rules against promoting such medications directly to the public. This was one of nine similar adverts banned by the regulator in a recent crackdown on the marketing of weight-loss treatments.</p>

The CBI is calling for lighter regulation, better marketing, and tax incentives to encourage investment in British companies.
