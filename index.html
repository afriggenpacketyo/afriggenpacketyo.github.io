          <p>The NHS in England plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients, referrals from GPs, and police, providing specialized care for individuals experiencing acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the initiative as a pioneering model of care, aiming to offer the right support in the right setting. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national implementation.</p>

This initiative, expected to launch in June, addresses criticism that the government has failed to curb price spikes affecting households due to inflation. Koizumi intends to bypass traditional auctions to directly control prices and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution of the lower-priced rice across the country.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are hesitant to get pregnant due to the potential return of severe symptoms like anxiety and suicidal thoughts upon discontinuing contraceptive pills, the primary treatment for the condition. PMDD, which affects up to 8% of women, often takes an average of 12 years to diagnose, leaving women in a difficult position when they wish to conceive. The Welsh government has stated its commitment to improving the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD, but many women still feel that there is a lack of research into PMDD.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan’s representative office and relocated it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling closer ties with Beijing. This decision follows a trend of diminishing Taiwanese presence in Africa, driven by the robust economic relationship between African nations and China. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, a move seen as retaliation for Taiwan's growing relations with Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia, underscoring the intensifying diplomatic tensions surrounding Taiwan's international recognition.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including prominent Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, have left the law firm Paul Weiss after the firm made a controversial agreement with former President Trump to avoid government targeting. The departures occurred after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises with the Trump administration, including auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services, following an executive order criticizing the firm for employing individuals connected to investigations into Trump. It is unclear if the departures are related to the agreement. </p>
