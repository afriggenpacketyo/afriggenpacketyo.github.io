        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump declared on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, scheduled to commence in approximately six hours, although neither Israeli nor Iranian officials have confirmed this announcement. According to Trump's statement, the agreement entails two 12-hour ceasefire periods, beginning with Iran, followed by Israel, after which the war will be officially declared over. This announcement follows two days after the U.S. joined Israel's war effort by launching strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, and the war began on June 12 with Israeli strikes against Iran's military and nuclear program. The optimism score is based on the assumption that the ceasefire will be successful and prevent further escalation. </p>

          <p>A significant fire erupted at Hotspur House, a landmark building in Manchester city center, causing a partial collapse and spreading to the neighboring tower block at 1 Cambridge Street, resulting in the evacuation of residents. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) reported that the fire is no longer being treated as a major incident, and Manchester City Council is providing overnight accommodation for those displaced. The fire disrupted train services through Manchester Oxford Road station, and the public was urged to avoid the area, with 20 fire engines responding to the scene. The fact that no deaths were reported is a source of optimism. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal based on potential torture or death. This decision lifts an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge in Massachusetts, with the Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissenting. Justice Sotomayor criticized the decision as a "gross abuse" of the Court's discretion, while a Homeland Security official tweeted "Fire up the deportation planes." The head of a legal group representing the immigrants expressed concern that the order strips away due process protections. </p>

          <p>ABC News interviewed several Trump voters following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, finding that most support the president's actions and trust him to protect American interests while avoiding a prolonged regional conflict. While some Republicans, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, criticized the strikes as a betrayal of the "America First" agenda, others viewed them as preventative measures to protect U.S. military interests and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Most Trump voters interviewed supported the decision to proceed without congressional approval, viewing the process of declaring wars as outdated and trusting the president's access to national security intelligence. The optimism score reflects the support for Trump's actions among his voter base. </p>

          <p>Top Democrats in Congress claim they were not adequately briefed before President Trump's decision to strike nuclear sites in Iran, leading to criticism that he bypassed constitutional war powers. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he received a brief call with no explanation and accused the president of potentially misleading the public, while Speaker Mike Johnson said he received a classified briefing. Several war powers resolutions have been introduced to require congressional approval for military action against Iran, though Johnson indicated such a resolution may not receive a vote. The level of transparency with Congress is a source of some optimism. </p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices, where insurers require permission before patients can receive medical treatment. Oz emphasized that this pledge is not a mandate but an opportunity for the industry to demonstrate its commitment to change, noting that a significant percentage of Americans have experienced delays or denials of care due to prior authorization. The agreement aims to standardize approval processes, expedite decisions, reduce the number of procedures requiring prior authorization, honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers, and create a public dashboard to track industry performance. The potential for improved healthcare access through reformed prior authorization contributes to the optimism score. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the world's oil supply and the subsequent impact on energy prices. While oil prices initially surged, they later declined as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for oil transport. Analysts suggest that Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities or attacks on Iraqi facilities by Iranian proxy groups pose a greater risk to the region's oil supply. A worst-case scenario involving the closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send oil prices soaring and negatively impact global GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's shift from discouraging Israeli military strikes against Iran to supporting them, and his mention of regime change, has created division within the Republican party. While some, like Vice President J.D.

This abrupt shift has surprised some of his aides and thrown the MAGA right into acrimony, as it deviates from the non-interventionist stance he touted during the 2024 campaign.

          <p>The Supreme Court's Republican justices have issued an order allowing President Trump to effectively bypass federal law and an international treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture. The order permits Trump to send immigrants to countries where they may face torture while the D.V.D. case is litigated, despite federal law stating that the U.S. should not return anyone to a country where they would be in danger of torture. This decision affects noncitizens who have already been through the process of having an immigration judge determine the countries to which they may be deported, but who are now being sent to other nations not previously under consideration. This action raises concerns about the Trump administration intentionally selecting unsafe countries for deportation. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without congressional approval has reignited debate over the division of war powers between Congress and the president. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as Commander in Chief, leading to ongoing conflict over the use of U.S. forces. Some lawmakers argue that the president should have sought congressional approval before taking military action, while others maintain that the president has the authority to act in cases of imminent danger. The debate underscores the enduring tension between the executive and legislative branches regarding military intervention. </p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities after the U.S. operation Midnight Hammer, with experts assessing the impact on sites like Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz. While President Trump claimed the sites were "completely and totally obliterated," other officials have been more cautious, awaiting a full battle damage assessment. Images show damage to Fordo, including craters, ash, and potentially blocked tunnel entrances, while Isfahan exhibits extensive damage to buildings. Natanz appears to have a large diameter hole over part of the underground complex, indicating a focus on underground facilities. </p>

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan have expressed concern that a potential U.S. war in the Middle East could strain American military resources, potentially impacting the U.S.'s ability to respond swiftly to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. With the U.S. already deeply involved in supporting Ukraine, there are worries that the U.S. may have fewer military assets and less political bandwidth to address a potential move by Beijing against Taiwan. While Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, the possibility of the U.S. managing two major conflicts simultaneously raises questions about the resources realistically available for Taiwan. The potential strain on US resources is a source of some concern. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting statements have emerged regarding the extent of the damage. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's nuclear ambitions had been "obliterated," while other officials and experts have been more cautious in their assessments. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine stated that it will "take some time" to assess the damage, and an Israeli official noted a lack of understanding of the extent of the damage. Experts suggest that it is unlikely that the bombs would have detonated in close vicinity to Fordo's underground structure, which is built deep beneath the ground. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are debating whether President Trump had the legal authority to launch strikes on Iran without consulting Congress, with some arguing that Article II of the Constitution grants the president authority to use military force in certain circumstances, such as actual or anticipated attacks. Others, however, argue that Trump did not have the authority as there was no sudden attack to repel. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, but this provision has rarely been used, and presidents have increasingly ordered military actions without congressional approval.

          <p>Pixar's new film, “Elio,” experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning only $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, possibly due to competition from other family-friendly movies and unfamiliarity with the original characters. The weak opening underscores the challenges original animated films face in the current market, where sequels and films based on existing intellectual property tend to perform better. However, Disney remains hopeful that “Elio” will gain traction over time, similar to the success of “Elemental.” </p>

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China would likely pursue quiet negotiations and prioritize its own self-interest, as demonstrated by its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. While about 16% of China's seaborne crude comes from Iran, its approach would remain shaped by long-standing economic interests.

          <p>A dangerous and prolonged heatwave is affecting much of the central and eastern US, prompting the National Weather Service (NWS) to issue extreme heat warnings and advisories. Several locations have recorded their hottest temperatures of the year, and cities under active heat alerts include Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Detroit, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Washington DC, and New York City. Oppressive humidity levels are driving heat index values into the triple digits, and night-time lows are offering little relief, increasing the risk of heat-related illness, particularly among vulnerable populations. Officials are urging the public to take precautions, stay hydrated, and check on those at risk. </p>
