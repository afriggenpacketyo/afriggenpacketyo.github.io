        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations commission of inquiry has stated that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, citing reasonable grounds to believe that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out since the start of the war with Hamas in 2023, including killing members of a group and inflicting serious harm. The report points to statements by Israeli leaders and the conduct of Israeli forces as evidence of genocidal intent. Israel's foreign ministry has categorically rejected the report, calling it "distorted and false," while the commission maintains its findings are the strongest and most authoritative UN findings to date on the conflict. The report concludes that Israeli leaders have incited genocide and that the state bears responsibility for failing to prevent it, urging other countries to act to prevent further crimes. The score is 10.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had state terrorism charges against him dismissed by a judge in New York City. The judge ruled that the terrorism charges were legally insufficient, although Mangione still faces other state and federal charges in connection with the killing. Mangione's lawyers had argued for the dismissal of all state charges, claiming double jeopardy, but this request was denied. The defense also sought to suppress evidence found in Mangione's backpack, but prosecutors disputed the allegations and requested the defense declare whether it will pursue an insanity defense. The score is 50.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luigi Mangione, suspected of attempting to assassinate UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, appeared in court as the NYPD warned business leaders and political figures about a heightened risk of assassinations. The warning follows the killing of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, and there are concerns that Mangione may have inspired copycats. The NYPD's Counterterrorism and Intelligence Bureau has reportedly assessed that public figures remain vulnerable at open-air events, which could be targeted by malicious actors with political or personal agendas. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state-level charges, including murder as an act of terrorism, and faces additional federal charges. The score is 25.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia are being urged by Human Rights Watch not to help cover up the country's human rights abuses. The festival is part of a series of events critics say are designed to obscure the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser. Human Rights Watch is calling on the entertainers to mitigate the positive effect their presence might have on the country's reputation by speaking out about the abuses. Tim Dillon claimed he's being paid $315,000 for a single show, while more famous colleagues would receive around $1.6 million. The score is 30.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady is facing criticism for appearing in the Las Vegas Raiders' coaching booth during a game against the Los Angeles Chargers. As a minority owner of the Raiders and a Fox broadcaster, his presence has raised concerns about a conflict of interest and unfair advantage. Critics argue that Brady's access to teams as a broadcaster gives the Raiders an unfair advantage, particularly when he is calling games for teams that Las Vegas will face later in the season. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll claims Brady's role is more conversational than strategic. The score is 40.</p>

          <p>Europe faces the upcoming winter with gas reserves at just over 80%, lower than previous years, but still stronger than in 2021. Diversified energy supplies from Russia, including LNG from Norway, the U.S., and Qatar, along with increased renewable energy use, have bolstered Europe's energy preparedness. While Brussels is giving EU gas stocks an extra month to reach 90% capacity, the bloc remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and weather volatility. Trump's pressure on Brussels to sanction buyers of Russian energy adds another layer of uncertainty, though the EU is in a stronger position to diversify its energy sources by 2027.

The U.S. State Department will ensure that South Koreans have the necessary visas, and a new "visa working group" will be established for the country. Experts warn that the immigration actions could lead to other foreign businesses reassessing their workforces in the U.S. The score is 50.</p>
