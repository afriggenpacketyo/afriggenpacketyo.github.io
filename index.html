          <p>A 76-year-old woman in Brooklyn was tragically killed after being struck by a solar panel that was torn from a carport structure by high winds during a nor'easter. The panel flew approximately 20 feet before hitting her, and she later died from her injuries at the hospital. The incident occurred while a wind advisory was in effect, with gusts in the area reaching over 40 mph. The Department of Buildings is currently investigating the circumstances of the fatal accident.</p>
