          <p>According to Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the U.S., the 10% tariff on most UK goods imported into the United States is likely to be permanent. While the universal tariff remains, Mandelson indicated there is potential for negotiations in specific sectors like technology. The statement comes amid ongoing uncertainty regarding separate, higher tariffs on British steel imports. This economic measure is part of a broader U.S. trade strategy that has also seen President Trump announce a 30% tariff on goods from the EU and Mexico. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time critic, Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. Trump's social media post cited O'Donnell not being in the "best interests" of the country, prompting a sharp response from the comedian. Legal experts note that the president lacks the authority to strip citizenship from a native-born American, referencing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that protects this constitutional right. This follows other administration efforts to limit citizenship paths, including a recently blocked executive order on birthright citizenship.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures peaking at 33°C and setting new records in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The extreme heat has prompted amber health alerts, wildfire warnings, and hosepipe bans for millions of residents in England. The conditions have also caused significant disruptions, including travel cancellations due to heat-damaged railway lines and the postponement of sporting events. Officials are urging public caution regarding fire risks and water safety as the country swelters.</p>

          <p>Luis Sharpe, a three-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle who played his entire 13-season career with the Cardinals franchise, has passed away at the age of 65. Sharpe was a first-round draft pick in 1982 and started in all 189 games he played. After his football career, he overcame a public battle with drug addiction and dedicated his later years to sobriety counseling in Detroit, working with the NFL to help other former players.

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired more than 20 employees who were involved in the investigations into former President Trump, including the classified documents case and the January 6th probe. This brings the total number of dismissals from former Special Counsel Jack Smith's teams to at least 35, with more potentially to come. The terminations were reportedly directed by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review Biden-era law enforcement policies.

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will implement a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. The decision was communicated in letters to the respective leaders, with Trump threatening to increase the tariffs further if either trading partner retaliates. This move is part of a broader "reciprocal" trade strategy that has seen the administration set new tariff rates for numerous countries this week. The EU and Mexico, which together account for about one-third of U.S. imports, have expressed their disagreement and vowed to protect their interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Market Analysis: Why Stocks Remained Stable Despite Renewed Tariff Threats</h2>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed threats of significant tariffs on major trading partners, the U.S. stock market has remained largely stable, with major indices near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style, preventing the panic selling seen during previous tariff announcements. The market's resilience is also attributed to strong underlying themes, such as the unfettered growth of the AI sector and a deregulatory environment that encourages mergers and acquisitions. This outlook suggests that corporate earnings potential is currently outweighing concerns over trade policy rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third Test between England and India is hanging in the balance after a tense third day at Lord's, which ended with the first-innings scores level. India was bowled out for 387, thanks to a late collapse where England took four wickets for just 11 runs. Earlier, India's innings was anchored by KL Rahul's century and a vital 72 from Ravindra Jadeja. The day concluded with a brief, contentious final over, setting up a finely balanced contest for the remaining two days of the match.</p>

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO has clarified the context behind the numbers. The closures are primarily due to the end of a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, and the shuttered locations were mostly small food court kiosks, not full-service restaurants. CEO Randy Sharpe stated the move is part of a strategy to focus on "quality, not quantity" and ensure every location represents the brand's standards. The chain also recently updated its menu with new summer-themed items.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are seeking a judicial review of government policy as part of a campaign to ban smartphones in all schools. They have sent a legal letter to the Education Secretary, arguing that the current guidance, which lets headteachers decide on phone use, is unlawful and fails to protect children. Citing risks of cyberbullying and exposure to harmful content, they advocate for a complete ban on smartphones, allowing only basic "brick phones" for communication. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones.</p>

          <p>The New Hollywood String Quartet is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a summer festival honoring the original Hollywood String Quartet of the 1940s and 50s. The original ensemble, formed by top film studio musicians, broke ground by bridging the worlds of classical and film music. The festival, introduced by conductor Leonard Slatkin—son of the original quartet's founders—features repertory from the earlier group's classic recordings. This event celebrates a rich legacy of genre-busting musicianship that continues to thrive in Los Angeles today.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people has revealed a puzzling detail from the cockpit voice recorder. Seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, causing a total loss of engine power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, to which the other replied that he did not. Investigators are trying to determine how the safety-locked switches were activated, a move that would be highly unusual and difficult to perform accidentally.</p>
