        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his sixth Grand Slam title and the world number one ranking at the US Open, defeating rival Jannik Sinner with a performance his coach lauded as "perfect." The 22-year-old Spaniard demonstrated remarkable consistency throughout the tournament, dropping only one set and being broken just three times across 22 sets, even against formidable opponents like Sinner and Djokovic. Alcaraz attributed his success to studying his Wimbledon loss to Sinner and diligently improving his serve, which became a crucial foundation for his naturally flamboyant, big-hitting game. This victory extends his impressive winning streak to 13 matches, solidifying his position as a dominant force in men's tennis and marking what he considers his career-best tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's Supreme Court ruled that Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are not receiving adequate food, ordering an immediate end to a food reduction policy enacted by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) brought the case, arguing that the policy, implemented after the Gaza war began, had caused malnutrition and starvation among inmates. Minister Ben-Gvir vehemently criticized the ruling, accusing the court of protecting "abominable murderers, kidnappers and rapists," while ACRI called for immediate implementation and condemned the prison conditions. Separately, US President Trump issued a "last warning" to Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal for hostage release from Gaza, highlighting the ongoing regional complexities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp 33% decline in August, contributing to the country's overall export growth slowing to a six-month low of 4.4% in U.S. dollar terms. This downturn is largely attributed to the fading boost from the U.S.-China trade truce and President Trump's increased tariffs on rerouted shipments, alongside persistent domestic real estate slump and rising job insecurity. Chinese exporters have increasingly sought higher market share in alternative regions like Southeast Asia and the EU due to weak internal demand, though the U.S. remains a critical trading partner. Economists anticipate potential policy rate cuts and further fiscal support from Beijing to counter the subdued growth and persistent deflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest has expanded dramatically by 10,000 acres in a single day, now scorching 46,619 acres and remaining 14% contained, prompting new evacuation orders in Fresno County. Despite intense smoke and aggressive fire activity, firefighters have successfully held primary containment lines, with officials noting the blaze's anticipated movement uphill was part of their strategy. Crews are actively reinforcing northern lines along McKinley Grove Road, where the fire is within three miles of a cherished grove of 200 giant sequoias, utilizing sprinkler systems to protect the ancient trees. Favorable forecasts for cooler and wetter weather in the coming days offer a crucial advantage for the challenging firefighting efforts.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has begun in Fort Pierce, Florida, for the trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump during a golf game last year. Prosecutors allege Routh methodically plotted for weeks before aiming a rifle at Trump, only to be thwarted by a Secret Service agent who spotted him and opened fire, causing Routh to flee without firing a shot. Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer, and will represent himself with standby counsel. The trial is expected to feature evidence including photos of Routh with a similar semi-automatic rifle, highlighting a serious security incident following a previous assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, with investor attention keenly focused on France's imminent confidence vote for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou later today. Bayrou is widely anticipated to lose the vote due to ongoing political wrangling over significant budget cuts totaling €44 billion, which aim to reduce France's deficit but face strong opposition. His potential ousting could compel President Emmanuel Macron to appoint the country's fifth prime minister in less than two years, signaling political instability. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher following Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, and U.S. stock futures remained stable ahead of critical inflation reports expected this week.

One pupil barrister, Eve Robinson, bravely recounted being sexually assaulted at a work event, leading to the perpetrator's suspension.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz celebrated his US Open title as the "best tournament" of his career, defeating rival Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to win his sixth Grand Slam title. The 22-year-old Spaniard showcased exceptional efficiency and consistency, dropping only one set and losing his serve just three times throughout the entire tournament, a significant improvement he had been working on. This victory also saw Alcaraz reclaim the world number one ATP ranking, a key goal for his season, after Sinner had held it for 65 consecutive weeks. Sinner, reflecting on his second Grand Slam final loss to Alcaraz this year, acknowledged his own "very predictable" play and expressed plans to make significant changes to his game.</p>

          <h2>China-U.S. Study Reveals Mars Possesses Unexpected Solid Inner Core</h2>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This discovery is surprising because Mars, given its expected cooling rate, was not anticipated to have formed a solid inner core yet, making it only the third celestial body after Earth and the moon with such a feature. The finding suggests a similar proportion to Earth’s inner core and could revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. This breakthrough provides significant new insights into planetary evolution and the internal structure of rocky planets.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Examining America's Historical Need for an External Enemy and the China Narrative</h2>

          <p>This opinion article critiques former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's assertion that China could serve as the "external threat" necessary to restore internal cohesion in American politics. The author argues that Emanuel's premises, suggesting China views America as a strategic adversary and that American division benefits China, are flawed and not supported by mainstream economists. The piece contends that America's internal divisions and political choices, such as re-electing President Trump, are domestic issues not attributable to China. It suggests that the narrative of needing an external enemy reflects a deeper, historical American pattern, rather than an accurate assessment of current geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>South Korea has reached an agreement with the U.S. to repatriate its citizens detained in a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, with a chartered plane arranged for their return once administrative procedures are complete. U.S. officials detained 475 people, over 300 of whom were South Korean nationals, accusing them of illegally working at the battery facility. President Trump defended the operation, urging foreign companies to "respect our Nation's Immigration Laws" while also suggesting foreign workers could train Americans in complex industries. A worker described the panic during the raid, highlighting that many were mechanics employed by a contractor, raising concerns amidst sensitive U.S.-South Korea trade talks.</p>

          <h2>Carlos Alcaraz Wins Second U.S. Open Amidst Match Delay Caused by Trump's Attendance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner to win his second U.S. Open title, but the match was notably delayed by President Trump's attendance, causing long lines and mixed crowd reactions. Trump, attending in Rolex's luxury box, made an on-camera appearance during the national anthem, which broadcasters were reportedly advised to edit for crowd reaction. His presence, the first by a sitting president at the U.S. Open in over two decades, sparked controversy, especially given recent U.S. tariffs on Swiss products from Rolex's home country. The event highlighted the unusual intersection of high-profile sports and political presence, drawing significant attention beyond the championship match itself.</p>
