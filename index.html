          <p>Richard Jefferson, a former teammate of LeBron James on the Cleveland Cavaliers, recently described the intense pressure of playing alongside the basketball superstar. While acknowledging it "sucks" due to James's extreme competitiveness and demand for excellence, Jefferson clarified this is a common trait among great athletes like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. He emphasized that despite the challenges, the ultimate goal of winning a championship with one of the greatest players ever made the experience worthwhile.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass violence by individuals who are not driven by a specific terrorist ideology. The proposed legislation would empower police to arrest suspects who are found to be planning or preparing for mass attacks, closing a legal gap that currently requires an ideological motive for such preemptive charges. This move follows the Southport attack, where the perpetrator lacked a clear ideological link, highlighting the need for new tools to address violence-fixated individuals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts a day off to help him mentally reset from a persistent and uncharacteristic season-long slump. After a poor performance following the All-Star break, Roberts decided to take the pressure off Betts, whose batting average has fallen to a career-low .241. The manager hopes that watching a game from the dugout will provide a different perspective and help Betts rediscover his form, emphasizing the mental benefits of the break.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon, according to sources familiar with the matter. Fulcher, who initially joined the Defense Department as part of a government efficiency team, was ousted amidst a broader staffing shakeup in Hegseth's office. The changes follow a recent scandal involving the leak of sensitive military plans on a messaging app, which led to the firing of other top aides.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to Mexico's policy of shifting flights from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims violates a trade agreement and unfairly disadvantages American carriers. This escalation marks a significant development in the trade relationship between the two countries, potentially impacting millions of travelers.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's Reddit post has gone viral after they declared a refusal to pay the standard 6% real estate agent commission, calling the traditional sales model "absurd" for high-value homes. The seller plans to use the "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) method, hiring an attorney and using a flat-fee service to list the property, potentially saving tens of thousands of dollars. The post sparked a widespread discussion, with many former FSBO sellers sharing their support and tips for navigating the process without a traditional agent.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to foster a closer security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, a partnership known as the "E3." This strategic shift is driven by the ongoing war in Ukraine and growing uncertainty over the United States' long-term commitment to European security under a potential Trump presidency. The cooperation, which includes a new bilateral treaty with the UK, aims to bolster Europe's defense capabilities, with France and the UK's nuclear deterrents playing a key role.</p>

          <p>An investigation has raised serious questions about the Ukrainian military's draft process, revealing cases where men with documented, severe mental illnesses have been deemed fit for service. Lawyers and human rights advocates report that flaws in the medical review system and a lack of access to complete health records are leading to the conscription of individuals unfit for combat. This not only violates their rights but also poses a significant danger to themselves and their fellow soldiers in high-stress environments.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler is in a dominant position to win his first Open Championship, holding a four-shot lead after the third round at Royal Portrush. Scheffler posted a solid, bogey-free 67 to reach 14 under par, pulling away from a chasing pack that includes China's Li Haotong and England's Matt Fitzpatrick. With a history of converting 54-hole leads into victories, Scheffler's seemingly unshakable form makes him the overwhelming favorite to claim the third leg of the career Grand Slam.</p>
