        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has strongly condemned a New York Times article about Orville Etoria, a Jamaican man convicted of murder who was deported by the Trump administration. The DHS accused the newspaper of publishing a "disgusting sob story" that downplayed the severity of his crime. Etoria, who earned degrees while imprisoned, was released in 2021 but was recently deported to Eswatini, a country where he is not a citizen, as part of a broader push to remove convicted criminals from the U.S. The controversy highlights the clash between narratives of rehabilitation and strict immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly higher as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit alongside a U.S. federal court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw gains, indicating some positive sentiment in the market. However, uncertainty over the future of U.S. trade policy weighed on investors, with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declining. The mixed results reflect a cautious approach as the region digests significant geopolitical and economic developments. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks his first visit to the country since 2019 and brings him together with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The gathering of the three leaders, all considered adversaries of the United States, occurs amid deepening ties between their nations and stalled denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang, highlighting a significant geopolitical alignment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has used advanced facial recognition technology on a 2011 photograph of a corpse from a secret Libyan mortuary, suggesting it has a high probability of being the revered Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr. Sadr mysteriously vanished during a trip to Libya in 1978, leading to decades of speculation. The new evidence, which indicates the person was executed, could potentially solve the long-standing mystery, though it contradicts the belief held by many of his followers that he is still alive. The investigation underscores the deep political and religious sensitivities surrounding his disappearance.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece discusses a growing intellectual trend of comparing the current political and institutional state of Western countries, like Britain, to the final years of the Soviet Union. The article notes the historical irony that the West is now facing internal critiques of dogma and rigidity once directed at its Cold War adversary. It posits that while history is unpredictable, the mere perception of Western decline is significant and could have serious consequences for the global order, regardless of whether a full collapse occurs.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is drawing attention to the significant accessibility issues within the historic Houses of Parliament.

Tidball is advocating for improvements to make the institution more inclusive and representative of the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has announced that there is a "decent chance" of the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, being visible across much of the country in the coming days. The increased likelihood is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which can push the stunning light display further south than is typical. While visibility is never guaranteed and depends on clear, dark skies away from city light pollution, the event could provide a rare and memorable spectacle for many people across the UK.</p>

          <p>A group of nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published an op-ed accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of endangering the health of all Americans. The bipartisan group, whose service spans multiple administrations, warns that Kennedy's actions—such as firing scientific staff, canceling vital research, and promoting unproven treatments—are dismantling the nation's public health system. They assert that his leadership is undermining the CDC's ability to protect the country from current and future health threats.</p>

          <h2>Recent Transfers Spark Debate on 'Player Power' in Premier League</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent transfers of strikers Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa, both of whom reportedly refused to train to force their moves, have intensified the debate over "player power" in professional football. Their success is contrasted with the case of defender Marc Guehi, who maintained his professionalism but saw his desired move to Liverpool collapse. This has led to a wider discussion on whether players are now incentivized to behave disruptively to achieve their goals, and whether clubs are hypocritical for demanding loyalty that they often do not reciprocate.</p>

          <p>While 38-year-old Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records at the US Open, this analysis raises questions about his physical ability to endure the tournament's grueling demands. Throughout his early matches, Djokovic has required treatment for various physical issues, echoing the injuries that affected his performance at the Australian Open and Wimbledon earlier this year. The article suggests that while his skill remains elite, the primary challenge to his quest for a 25th Grand Slam title may be whether his aging body can withstand two weeks of best-of-five-set matches.</p>

At a large gathering in Wilmington, California, labor leaders argued that the administration's policies on immigration and trade are weakening unions and harming workers. They specifically cited immigration raids and the chaotic effects of tariffs on port workers. In contrast, a White House proclamation for the holiday stated that President Trump's actions are "reversing decades of neglect and finally putting American Workers first."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that President Trump's hesitation to impose more severe sanctions on Russia, despite its ongoing war in Ukraine, is rooted in strategic geopolitical concerns. According to analysts, the administration is wary of completely isolating Moscow, fearing it would push Russia into an even deeper and more powerful alliance with China. This potential outcome could grant Beijing unfettered access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic territories, which Washington views as a significant long-term threat. This fear, combined with a desire to be seen as a peacemaker, may be tempering U.S. policy.</p>

However, Maduro's government, which Washington has accused of running a drug cartel, views the move as a direct military threat aimed at regime change, further escalating the already high tensions between the two nations.</p>
