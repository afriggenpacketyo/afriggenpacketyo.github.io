          <p>A massive 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in Niger. Its authenticity was verified by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The rare artifact, representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, is expected to fetch between $2 and $4 million.</p>

          <p>The hobby of amateur genetic genealogy is proving to be a powerful tool for law enforcement in solving decades-old cold cases. This article highlights the work of pioneer Barbara Rae-Venter, whose research into her own family tree led to techniques that unmasked the notorious Golden State Killer. Her methods, which involve tracing family histories through DNA, are now being used by prosecutors to identify and capture long-sought criminals. This innovative approach is changing the landscape of crime fighting by closing seemingly unsolvable cases.</p>

This move aims to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban on new sales. While specific details on grants were not confirmed, the government acknowledged that the high upfront cost is a major barrier for many. The plan also includes a £63 million investment to improve charging infrastructure, particularly for households without private driveways.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza has killed ten people, among them six children, who were queuing for water. According to emergency officials and eyewitnesses, a drone fired a missile into the crowd. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating a "technical error" caused a munition to strike away from its intended target, an Islamic Jihad militant, and expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians. The event is under review amid escalating attacks and a rising number of casualties near aid distribution sites.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third major heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recording their warmest days and England seeing temperatures exceed 33°C. The intense heat has led to amber health alerts, hosepipe bans for millions, and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. Tragically, the heatwave's dangers were highlighted by the death of a 15-year-old boy in a river incident in Glasgow.

          <p>While conducting a sonar survey of the Fox River in Wisconsin, researchers unintentionally discovered the well-preserved wreck of a 19th-century ship. The team was originally mapping other known cultural sites when their high-resolution sonar detected a 90-foot-long hull, believed to be the L.W. Crane. This wooden paddle wheel steamer caught fire and sank in 1880 while transporting passengers and freight. The unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, and further investigations are underway to learn more about the vessel.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a novel biotransformation system that can convert methanol, which can be derived from carbon dioxide, into sucrose, or white sugar. This breakthrough offers a potential solution to both environmental and food security challenges by creating food from captured CO2 without relying on traditional agriculture. The method uses enzymes to facilitate the conversion and has also been adapted to produce other complex carbohydrates like fructose and starch. The researchers suggest this could be a highly promising platform for sustainable biomanufacturing.</p>

          <p>The Delgado family, now in its fourth generation of luthiers, continues a nearly century-old tradition of building and restoring guitars in Nashville. Manuel Delgado and his daughters, Ava and Lila, use old-world techniques passed down from their great-grandfather in Mexico, favoring hand tools over modern machinery to craft their instruments. Their artisanship has attracted famous clients, including Dolly Parton and the band Los Lobos. The family's dedication to their craft was recently showcased at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, highlighting their role in preserving cultural traditions.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and Japan have escalated after a series of close encounters between their military aircraft over the East China Sea. Japan's defense ministry accused a Chinese fighter-bomber of making "unusual approaches" toward one of its electronic-intelligence planes, warning such actions could lead to an accidental collision. In response, China's defense ministry claimed its forces were lawfully monitoring Japanese aircraft that had "repeatedly" entered China's air defense identification zone. Beijing asserted that Japan's close-in reconnaissance is the root cause of security risks in the region.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government implements aggressive new tariffs, consumers are experiencing the direct financial impact through surprise fees on imported goods. This article details the experience of a man who was required to pay an unexpected $1,170 customs fee to receive a side table he purchased from Mexico. Experts explain that while businesses often absorb these costs into prices, carriers are increasingly passing the duties directly to the end consumer at the point of delivery. This practice is becoming more common as high tariff rates make it unfeasible for companies to absorb the cost.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, a highly contagious virus. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously unwell children being admitted with the illness, treating 17 patients for measles since June. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to a decline in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In the north-west of England, vaccination rates are at 85%, below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization, raising serious public health concerns.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, analyses are focusing on the event's dual impact on national security and politics. The attack, which killed firefighter Corey Comperatore, exposed what many call a catastrophic Secret Service lapse, prompting multiple investigations and 37 recommended reforms. Politically, Trump's survival and defiant response were seen by supporters as heroic, galvanizing his base and contributing to a perception of strength that contrasted with then-President Biden's subsequent withdrawal from the election. The incident continues to shape political discourse and security protocols.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has erupted between China and India over the succession plan for the 14th Dalai Lama, potentially straining the recent thaw in their relations. The conflict was ignited by an Indian minister's statement that only the Dalai Lama and his institution can identify his successor, followed by Prime Minister Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader. Beijing responded with formal protests, asserting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition. Observers note that while Tibet is a sensitive issue, the dispute is unlikely to completely derail recent improvements in bilateral ties.</p>

Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and have remarkable regenerative abilities, the process is considered humane. The low-cost, scalable technology could revolutionize ocean monitoring, making it more accessible for smaller labs and conservation groups to gather widespread data.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that LeBron James, now playing on a one-year contract with the Lakers for the first time in his career, could look to Kobe Bryant's 2015 retirement as a model for his own exit from the sport. Bryant's decision to announce his retirement early allowed for a season-long farewell tour that reshaped his public image and gave fans a chance to celebrate his career. The author argues that with the Lakers now building around Luka Doncic, James could control his own narrative by planning a graceful, celebrated departure, similar to Bryant's.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing and homelessness crisis, California is creating a new state agency dedicated solely to these issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, will split the current Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two, creating a cabinet-level secretary for housing. Supporters hope this will elevate the issue and streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing finance programs. While critics question if a bureaucratic reshuffle alone can solve the problem, advocates see it as a crucial first step toward more focused leadership.</p>

          <p>Despite a low overall unemployment rate, recent college graduates in the class of 2025 are struggling to find work in a skittish job market. Economists note that cautious employers, particularly in government and tech, are hiring less, leaving fewer entry-level opportunities. Many graduates are forced to take jobs outside their field of study or accept lower salaries than anticipated, creating a significant gap between expectations and reality. While a degree still provides an advantage, graduates are being advised to be more flexible and view their first job as a stepping stone.</p>
