          <p>President Trump asserted that Los Angeles was under siege due to illegal immigration, leading him to deploy the National Guard. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom disputed Trump's depiction, stating local law enforcement could manage the situation. Protests erupted following reports of ICE raids, resulting in clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. The deployment of the National Guard without the governor's consent marked a rare instance, drawing legal challenges from Newsom, who accused Trump of authoritarianism. The situation in Los Angeles remained tense as protests continued, with differing accounts of the severity of the unrest from federal and local officials. The events underscore the ongoing debate over immigration policy and federal-state relations. </p>

          <p>President Trump has frequently invoked Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to block the entry of noncitizens into the United States, leading to travel bans and restrictions. While some of these attempts have been challenged in court, Trump has succeeded in expanding presidential powers to ban foreign nationals under immigration law. The Supreme Court's decision upholding Trump's first travel ban affirmed the president's broad authority in this area. The article examines the implications of Trump's aggressive use of Section 212(f) and the potential for future legal challenges.</p>

It also delves into the economic theories behind why people's feelings about the economy can influence spending and investment decisions. While the article acknowledges the limitations of these informal signs, it suggests that widespread discussion of recession indicators could reflect underlying economic anxieties.
