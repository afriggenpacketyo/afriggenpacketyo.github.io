        <h2>Trump's proposal to make Canada the 51st US state sparks debate.</h2>

        <p>President Trump's repeated suggestions to annex Canada as the 51st US state have raised questions about his seriousness.  While Trump maintains his stance, his ambassador nominee affirmed Canada's sovereignty. Canadian leaders view the threat as a serious matter, rejecting any possibility of annexation. Trump's argument centers on the perceived arbitrariness of the US-Canada border.  Statehood requires congressional approval and a referendum, which polls suggest Canadians would likely oppose.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The EU's retaliatory tariffs on US goods, in response to Trump's trade policies, are expected to significantly impact certain US states.  States like California (almonds), Tennessee (whiskey), and Michigan (auto parts) face substantial losses.  The tariffs could drive down demand or shut down markets entirely, as consumers opt for cheaper alternatives.  The potential impact is far-reaching, affecting a wide variety of products and states.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration is initiating the process of dismantling numerous environmental regulations, including those aimed at protecting air and water quality and addressing climate change. This move could severely undermine the nation's ability to meet its climate goals, despite potential legal challenges and opposition from environmental groups. The administration justifies the changes by focusing on boosting domestic energy production and lowering living costs.</p>
