          <p>Google and Kairos Power are collaborating to deploy an advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee by 2030 to power Google's data centers. The Tennessee Valley Authority has agreed to purchase power from the Hermes 2 reactor, marking the first U.S. utility to sign such an agreement with an advanced reactor developer. This project aims to commercialize smaller, more affordable nuclear technology, with Google and Kairos bearing the initial financial risks to avoid costs for consumers. The plant represents a significant step toward using reliable, carbon-free energy to meet the growing demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has re-strengthened into a major Category 4 storm. While it is not expected to make landfall in the United States, the National Hurricane Center warns it will generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along the entire East Coast this week. The storm's large size means its effects, including high waves and strong winds in outer rainbands, will be felt in coastal areas like North Carolina's Outer Banks, where some evacuations have been ordered. Forecasters expect Erin to remain a powerful hurricane as it moves between Bermuda and the U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Tom Barrack announced that discussions for a ceasefire agreement with Israel will proceed after Lebanon's government endorsed a U.S.-backed plan for the disarmament of Hezbollah. The plan aims to resolve long-standing conflict at the border, with Washington also preparing an economic proposal for post-war reconstruction in Lebanon. The move has angered the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has vowed to resist disarmament, raising fears of potential civil unrest. This diplomatic effort follows months of cross-border combat and represents a significant step towards stabilizing the volatile region.</p>

          <p>The trend of workers frequently changing jobs for better opportunities, known as the 'great resignation,' has been replaced by 'job hugging,' where employees hold onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty. Organizational consultants note that key labor market indicators like hires, quits, and layoffs are all low, suggesting stagnation. This shift is driven by a cooling job market and fears about the difficulty of finding new employment. While providing stability, experts warn that this trend could lead to career stagnation and lower wage growth for individuals who remain in their roles for too long.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Donald Trump, has publicly called on India to cease its purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the practice 'opportunistic.' This statement reflects escalating trade tensions, with the Trump administration planning to increase tariffs on India to 50% over the issue. India defends its actions as a necessity to ensure affordable energy for its citizens, pointing out that Western nations also continue to trade with Russia. The dispute marks a significant shift from the previous administration's price cap policy and complicates the strategic partnership between the U.S. and India.</p>

The attack left a nine-year-old girl with a bullet permanently lodged in her brain while she was eating ice cream with her family. Riley was also convicted of the attempted murder of three men who were the intended targets in a feud between rival Turkish gangs. While Riley was identified as playing a key role in the operation, the gunman who fired the shots from a motorbike remains at large.</p>

          <p>With a tariff truce extended to November, U.S. and Chinese negotiators face significant hurdles in forging a new trade agreement. Beijing is expected to adopt a more assertive negotiating stance than in the past, demanding concessions from Washington such as relaxed export controls and lower tariffs for a more balanced deal. China has also successfully diversified its economy, reducing its dependence on the U.S. as an export market since 2018. Furthermore, Beijing has developed its own countermeasures, like restricting critical mineral exports, giving it more leverage in the high-stakes talks.</p>

The scale helps estimate the potential for property damage, with storms of Category 3 or higher designated as 'major' hurricanes capable of causing catastrophic harm. The explainer details the wind speeds and expected damage for each category, citing historical examples like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Ian. It clarifies that while there is no official Category 6, the concept is discussed by scientists due to increasingly extreme storms.</p>

          <p>Indian financial markets rallied following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of significant tax reforms, including simplifying the goods and services tax (GST) structure. The proposed changes are expected to boost domestic consumption and key sectors like manufacturing and automotive, providing a buffer against economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs. This focus on strengthening the domestic economy is seen as a strategic move to offset the impact of Washington's planned 50% duties on Indian imports. Analysts believe the stimulus from the tax overhaul could be substantial, given that domestic consumption is the primary driver of India's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

Research shows that nearly 60% of workers retire earlier than intended, often due to unforeseen health issues, employment problems like age discrimination, or family responsibilities. The decline of pensions has shifted the burden of saving onto individuals through 401(k) plans, which can be vulnerable to market downturns and job losses.

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes meeting at the White House, President Donald Trump declared that Ukraine would not be permitted to join NATO as part of a potential peace agreement with Russia. In a social media post, he also asserted that Ukraine would not regain the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. These statements signal a significant shift in the U.S. position, aligning more closely with Moscow's demands and placing immense pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The remarks came as Zelenskyy and several European leaders arrived in Washington for crucial talks on ending the war.</p>

          <p>Famed director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken a six-city tour to promote and discuss the themes of his 2024 film, 'Megalopolis,' in an unusual effort to build a cult following for the project. The film, a passion project self-funded by Coppola for $120 million, was a critical and commercial failure upon its release. The live events, billed as 'An Evening with Francis Ford Coppola,' feature the director engaging in long, unmoderated discussions on broad topics like politics, art, and society. This direct attempt by a creator to facilitate a cult legacy is unconventional, as such followings typically emerge organically from audience devotion over time.</p>

          <p>The death toll from severe wildfires in Spain and Portugal has risen to four after two more firefighters were killed in separate accidents while battling the blazes. Spain has deployed an additional 500 troops, bringing the total to 1,900, to combat fires that are still burning out of control in several regions, forcing the evacuation of 27,000 residents. The Castile and León region is the most affected, with smoke making the air 'unbreathable.' This year, fires have burned nearly double the amount of land in Spain compared to the previous year, exacerbated by a heatwave scorching southern Europe.</p>

          <p>Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has announced he will run for the Senate again in 2026 to represent Ohio, less than a year after losing his reelection campaign. Brown, who had been the only Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio, was defeated in November 2024 in a key race that helped Republicans take control of the Senate. In his announcement, he stated he was running to 'stand up for workers' and make a difference for the state. He is expected to face Republican Senator Jon Husted in a special election for the seat previously held by Vice President JD Vance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipping container data reveals that major retailers like Walmart and Target accelerated imports of popular items ahead of threatened U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. This 'front-loading' strategy involved bringing in products such as holiday decorations, toys, and electronics earlier than usual to avoid higher costs. The data shows distinct spikes in shipping volumes during periods of tariff uncertainty in 2024 and 2025. While this preemptive action helped manage tariff-related expenses, it also contributed to higher freight costs and illustrates the complex logistical challenges retailers face amid volatile trade policies.

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This will be the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the conflict, involving the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization coordinating their travel. The initiative follows a letter from a cross-party group of MPs urging the government to act without delay to save children at risk due to the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has reportedly stopped issuing visitor visas for critically injured Palestinian children from Gaza seeking medical care in the United States.

The aid group Heal Palestine, which coordinates the medical treatments, expressed distress, clarifying that their work is a temporary humanitarian program, not a resettlement effort. The suspension of the visas was celebrated by some Republican members of Congress, who cited unspecified national security risks.</p>

          <p>Authorities and volunteers in northwestern Pakistan are continuing rescue operations following devastating flash floods that have killed more than 300 people and left over 200 missing. The efforts have been hampered by fresh rainfall, which has destroyed makeshift access roads to the worst-hit areas in the Buner district. The flooding was caused by a cloudburst, an extreme weather event that saw over 150 millimeters of rain fall within an hour. The disaster highlights Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change, with this year's monsoon season proving to be significantly more intense than the last.</p>

          <p>Final arguments are underway in the landmark national security trial of Jimmy Lai, the 77-year-old founder of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. Lai faces charges of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, which could result in a life sentence under a law imposed by Beijing in 2020. Prosecutors argued that Lai continued to call for foreign sanctions against China and Hong Kong even after his arrest. The high-profile case is widely viewed as a critical test of press freedom and judicial independence in the city following the 2019 anti-government protests.</p>

His comments add to a growing chorus of experts warning that investment in AI is moving too quickly, potentially creating pockets of overvaluation for companies with weaker fundamentals despite the industry's strong long-term trajectory.

An employee from the Russian embassy presented the new motorcycle to a speechless Warren as a 'personal gift' from President Putin. The motorcycle company, Ural, was founded in Soviet Russia but moved all its production out of the country to Kazakhstan following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
