          <p>PayPal has announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year outlook for both transaction margin dollars and earnings per share. The report highlighted significant growth in its Venmo platform, with revenue increasing by over 20% and total payment volume growing at its fastest rate in three years. Despite the positive financial performance and optimistic forecast, which implies a strong fourth quarter, the company's stock experienced a slight decline following the announcement. CEO Alex Chriss emphasized that the profitable growth was driven by strategic initiatives across the company's branded experiences and payment services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has issued a 2025 earnings outlook that falls below analyst predictions, citing ongoing struggles with elevated medical costs within its insurance division. The company's stock fell over 4% after it projected adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share, significantly lower than the $20.91 expected by Wall Street. This announcement adds to a series of setbacks for the healthcare giant, which is also dealing with Department of Justice investigations and the aftermath of a major cyberattack. The report suggests that high expenses in Medicare Advantage plans may continue to affect the entire health insurance industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Technology Secretary Faces Backlash for Comparing Nigel Farage to Jimmy Savile</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:08:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has demanded an apology from Technology Secretary Peter Kyle after the minister made inflammatory comments during a debate on the UK's Online Safety Act. Kyle suggested that by opposing the new law, Farage was siding with sexual offenders like the late Jimmy Savile, a remark Farage called "absolutely disgusting." The controversy stems from Reform UK's pledge to repeal the act, arguing it suppresses free speech and is ineffective at protecting children online. Kyle defended the law as a significant step forward, while a Reform UK representative labeled the minister's accusation as outrageous and denigrating to Savile's victims.</p>

          <p>A murder investigation has been launched in Bermondsey, south London, after a stabbing incident at a commercial property resulted in the deaths of two men. The Metropolitan Police were called to the scene on Monday afternoon, where a 58-year-old man was pronounced dead; a 27-year-old man later died in the hospital. Two other men were also injured, one of whom is in a life-threatening condition and has been detained in connection with the attack. Police believe the victims were known to each other and have described it as an isolated incident, though it has left the local community shocked.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Merck has revealed a major restructuring initiative aimed at cutting $3 billion in costs by the end of 2027, with the savings intended to fund new product launches. This move is part of the company's strategy to prepare for the 2028 patent expiration of its blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda. In its second-quarter report, Merck also announced it was narrowing its full-year guidance for revenue and adjusted earnings. The company's stock declined as it reported revenue that missed analyst estimates, partly due to continued weak sales of its Gardasil vaccine in China. (not investment advice)</p>

Economists warn that mass deportations could lead to millions of job losses for both immigrants and US-born workers, impacting sectors from construction to hospitality.

While Kennedy's 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative aims to reduce Americans' exposure to toxins, the EPA has moved to relax standards for pesticides, lead, and mercury, and has delayed action on PFAS and other chemicals. Leaders within the MAHA movement are now pressuring Kennedy to challenge the EPA's actions, which they see as directly contradicting their goals.

          <p>President Trump's proposed blanket tariffs, set to begin August 1, are expected to increase the prices of certain imported foods for American consumers, according to a new analysis by the Tax Foundation.

The report highlights that liqueurs, baked goods, coffee, fish, and beer are among the top imports that could see significant price hikes.

          <p>Thommy Ten and Amélie van Tass, the mentalist duo known as The Clairvoyants who were runners-up on "America's Got Talent," are returning to the U.S. stage with a new tour. The Austrian couple, known for their theatrical mind-reading and precognition acts, recently joined magician Shin Lim's Las Vegas residency after a brief hiatus to start a family. Their act challenges stereotypes by presenting them as equal partners, blending traditional magic with psychic-themed performances. Since their television success, they have gained international recognition and numerous awards, bringing their large-scale, interactive brand of mentalism to a global audience.</p>

          <p>To combat a growing shortage of skilled watch repair technicians in the U.S., luxury watch brand Rolex has opened a new watchmaking school in Dallas. The 18-month, tuition-free program focuses specifically on training students to service Rolex timepieces, with graduates likely to work for Rolex-affiliated jewelers or the company itself. The initiative comes as interest in mechanical watches is resurgent, while the number of watchmakers has declined significantly, creating a workforce crisis. While independent schools train watchmakers for a variety of brands, the Rolex school's specialized approach aims to directly meet the high demand for servicing its own products.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the year's most anticipated celestial events, is set to peak on the night of August 11-12, but viewing conditions will be challenging. According to astronomers, a bright, waning gibbous moon will be about 92% full, and its glare will obscure many of the fainter meteors. While the Perseids can typically produce up to 100 meteors per hour at their peak, far fewer will be visible this year. Stargazers are advised to find locations far from city lights to maximize their chances, and they can still hope to see some of the shower's signature fireballs, which are brighter and longer-lasting.</p>

          <p>California may redraw its congressional district lines in an unusual mid-decade move, a direct response to a similar effort by Republicans in Texas. After President Trump urged Texas to redraw its maps to gain up to five GOP seats in the 2026 midterms, California Governor Gavin Newsom threatened to counter by altering his state's districts to favor Democrats. This political showdown challenges California's independent, bipartisan redistricting commission, which was established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The potential for a redistricting war has created strange political alliances and raises questions about the future of fair representation and trust in the political system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) has been forced to stop new enrollments in its time-limited subsidy program, a key tool for moving people out of homelessness, due to significant budget cuts. Service providers describe the program, which helps individuals pay rent for a limited period, as a "superhighway out of homelessness" and warn that its suspension will create a bottleneck in the system. The cuts, stemming from reduced state funding and expiring grants, come despite voters approving a new sales tax to address the crisis. Providers are already seeing the impact, with fewer people moving from shelters into permanent housing, thus limiting shelter availability for those on the street.</p>

          <p>The recent repeal of Canada's consumer carbon price serves as a cautionary tale about the political challenges of implementing climate policy. The policy, designed to be revenue-neutral by returning funds to consumers via rebates, was successfully branded by opponents as a burdensome "tax" during a cost-of-living crisis. Catherine McKenna, the former minister who architected the policy, notes that the government lost control of the narrative and advises against using the word "tax" for such programs. The episode highlights the difficulty governments face in balancing the costs of the green transition and the importance of clear, sustained messaging to maintain public support for climate action.</p>
