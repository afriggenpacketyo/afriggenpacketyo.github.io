          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant technology issue that led to a nationwide ground stop for several hours, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and Newark. The airline confirmed the problem has been resolved but warned of residual delays as they work to restore normal operations. Officials stated the disruption was an internal issue, not related to cybersecurity, and United is treating it as a preventable delay, meaning the company will cover applicable customer expenses like hotels. The Federal Aviation Administration offered support to help manage the flight backlog.</p>

          <p>A massive and "unprecedented" wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, having already burned through 16,000 hectares of land. The blaze, described as the largest in the region in nearly 80 years, has resulted in one death, one person missing, and thirteen injuries, including nine firefighters. Authorities have evacuated several villages and campsites in the popular tourist area, with officials warning that unfavorable weather conditions are likely to hamper containment efforts. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has called the event a "catastrophe of unprecedented scale" linked to global warming.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong performance, with exports rising 7.2% year-over-year, significantly beating economists' forecasts. This growth occurred amid an ongoing tariff truce with the United States, providing a potential boost to the nation's economy. In another positive sign, imports also saw their largest increase in a year, climbing 4.1% and defying predictions of a decline. This marks the first month of import growth this year, suggesting a potential recovery in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The announcement of a potential 100% U.S. tariff on foreign-made semiconductor chips has caused mixed reactions across Asian markets. Japanese chip-related stocks, including Tokyo Electron and Renesas Electronics, saw significant declines following the news. In contrast, South Korean giants Samsung and SK Hynix, along with Taiwan's TSMC, experienced gains as they are expected to be exempt due to their substantial investments in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. The policy's details remain unclear, but it appears to favor large companies with the capital to build in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted a raid at a Los Angeles Home Depot, reportedly using a Penske rental truck as a "Trojan horse" to approach and arrest day laborers. The operation, which led to 16 arrests, has reignited fears in the community and drawn criticism from city leaders, who question if it violates a recent court order against racial profiling. Immigrant advocates and Mayor Karen Bass have expressed alarm over the tactics, while federal officials maintain they are targeting criminal elements. Penske Truck Rental stated it was unaware of its vehicle's use in the operation and prohibits such actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 100% tariff on imported computer chips and semiconductors, a move that could significantly increase the cost of electronics and automobiles. The plan includes an exemption for companies that manufacture their chips within the United States, aiming to incentivize domestic production. This tariff-based strategy marks a sharp contrast to the CHIPS and Science Act, which uses subsidies and tax credits to achieve similar goals. The announcement was made during a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, as Apple itself is highly reliant on global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have canceled a major $3 billion environmental project designed to rebuild the state's rapidly eroding coastal wetlands. The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion aimed to use the Mississippi River's own sediment to naturally restore thousands of acres of marshland, which serves as a critical buffer against hurricane storm surge. The project was scrapped following strong opposition from the local fishing and oystering industry in Plaquemines Parish, who feared it would destroy their livelihoods. Scientists and environmental advocates argue that abandoning the project leaves the coast vulnerable and represents a major setback in the long-term fight against land loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study from the World Weather Attribution group has concluded that climate change likely made Pakistan's recent monsoon season significantly heavier, exacerbating the deadly floods. Researchers found that rainfall was 10% to 15% more intense due to global warming, as a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. The severe weather has led to at least 300 deaths since late June, with many victims killed by collapsing buildings in flood-prone urban areas. The report highlights the vulnerability of the nation's rapidly growing urban populations and underscores the increasing impact of climate change on extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) indicates that councils in inner London are poised to be the biggest financial losers under a government plan to reform local authority funding. Some London boroughs could see funding drop by up to 12% after accounting for inflation. The proposed changes, set to be phased in from 2026, aim to redirect funds to areas with greater needs and a higher share of lower-band council tax properties. While some urban areas outside the capital and in outer London are expected to benefit, the plan is effectively redistributing existing funds rather than increasing the total amount.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has described the latest U.S. jobs report as "concerning," pointing specifically to the significant downward revisions for May and June hiring. She noted that such large revisions are often typical of economic "turning points," signaling potential uncertainty and a slowdown in economic activity. The July report showed weaker-than-expected job growth and erased 258,000 previously reported jobs from the prior two months. Cook also spoke of an "uncertainty tax" weighing on businesses as they navigate macroeconomic instability and the impact of new tariffs, which could dampen future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's justification for firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner rests on claims that the agency manipulated jobs data before the election, but his timeline of events is incorrect. Trump alleged that large downward revisions to job numbers were released after the election, but the major revision of over 800,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the vote. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used to criticize his opponent at the time. Experts affirm it would be nearly impossible to rig the data as he claims.</p>

Prosecutors have also filed legal findings that could allow them to pursue the death penalty, citing substantial planning and noting that the defendant had allegedly expressed support for violence against Israelis in social media posts prior to the attack.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a significant blow to specific sectors of India's economy. While only a small fraction of India's total GDP is tied to U.S. exports, industries like gems and jewellery, apparel, textiles, and chemicals are disproportionately exposed and most vulnerable to the levies. In contrast, key export sectors such as IT services and pharmaceuticals are not targeted by the current goods-focused tariffs and are expected to be largely insulated from the direct impact. The new tariffs, a response to India's oil trade with Russia, are scheduled to take effect in 21 days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, UCAS, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old domestic students are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year. This trend is partly attributed to financial uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, which makes UK undergraduates a more stable and attractive option for universities' financial planning. As a result, institutions may be more flexible with admissions, potentially accepting students who narrowly miss their conditional grade offers. This comes as thousands of students across the UK prepare to receive their A-level and other final school results next week.</p>

Despite his efforts, the team's bullpen faltered, allowing four runs in the final five innings to squander the lead.
