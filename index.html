          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick, killing 241 passengers and crew, as well as five people on the ground. The flight, AI171, went down in a residential area near the airport, hitting a medical college. One passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national of Indian origin, survived the crash and is being treated at a local hospital. Indian authorities, with assistance from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, are investigating the cause of the crash, with initial reports suggesting the plane struggled to gain altitude and may have experienced engine issues. The crash marks the first fatal incident involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. </p>

Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla attempted to ask Noem a question during the event and was subsequently pushed out of the room, handcuffed, and placed on the ground by federal agents. While Noem stated that she and Padilla had a productive conversation afterward, many lawmakers, including Sen. Adam Schiff, are calling for an investigation into the incident and Noem's resignation.

          <p>The House narrowly voted to cut approximately $9.4 billion in previously approved spending, targeting foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for NPR and PBS.

The Trump administration is employing a rarely used tool to request the cancellation of previously appropriated funds, requiring only a simple majority in the Senate for passage.
