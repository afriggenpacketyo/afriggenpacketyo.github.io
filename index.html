          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced in a memo that the central bank plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years. This reduction will involve offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees. The move aims to consolidate functions, modernize practices, and ensure the Fed is appropriately sized to meet its mission. The announcement comes amid pressure from the Trump administration for cost cuts across civil service agencies, though Powell's memo did not explicitly mention this as a factor.</p>

          <p>Everton Football Club has announced that legal firm Hill Dickinson will be the naming rights partner for its new stadium.

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal fraud charge against Boeing related to the two 737 Max crashes. The Department of Justice (DOJ) officials informed families of the victims that they might pursue a non-prosecution agreement instead of a trial. This move follows the rejection of an earlier settlement where Boeing agreed to plead guilty. Lawyers representing the families expressed their disappointment, stating that Boeing has never faced trial for the loss of 346 lives and may now avoid accountability with just a financial penalty.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts under President Trump's agenda are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. The bill aims to provide tax breaks by cutting spending, including significant reductions to Medicaid. An analysis suggests these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans argue the cuts target fraud and abuse without affecting coverage, many beneficiaries fear losing essential services like nursing home care and medication assistance, potentially forcing difficult choices between healthcare and basic necessities.</p>

          <p>A military parade is planned in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday.

The Syrian government has also signed an $800 million deal with DP World to develop the port of Tartus, signaling growing confidence among international investors.

          <p>President Trump's first major foreign trip to the Middle East was marked by opulent displays and a focus on securing deals for the United States. The trip, which played to Trump's ego, saw financial agreements struck with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar's gift to Trump of a Boeing 747, described as a "flying palace," has drawn criticism and raised constitutional concerns. Trump's approach prioritized transactions over principles, with little public discussion of democracy or human rights.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners. The group complained that the bulk of savings in the legislation wouldn't take effect until after Trump leaves office. This is a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump, who had called for unity behind the bill. House Republican leaders will continue negotiations with holdouts, and the Budget Committee will reconvene soon.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has transformed into a prominent figure in Washington, joining corporate boards and launching an exclusive private club called "Executive Branch."

Critics express concerns about the mingling of private business interests and government policy, while allies argue that Trump Jr. is a skilled entrepreneur capitalizing on his connections.</p>

          <p>Epic Games stated that 'Fortnite' will be offline on Apple devices due to Apple blocking a recent app update. This dispute follows a judge's ruling that limited Apple's commissions on third-party apps. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney had stated that 'Fortnite' would return to the App Store if Apple extended the court's ruling globally. Apple claims it requested Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting a photo with the numbers "86 47" on Instagram, which some federal officials allege was a call for violence against President Trump. Comey later deleted the post and claimed he didn't realize the numbers' violent connotations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the issue is under investigation. The post has sparked outrage from Trump administration officials and supporters, while Comey has been a vocal critic of Trump.</p>
