          <p>China's top security officials are calling for increased vigilance and dedication from the country's security and law enforcement apparatus due to mounting external tensions that threaten internal stability. Yin Bai, a high-ranking official, stressed the need for absolute loyalty to the Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, demanding strict adherence to party directives. He also acknowledged existing inadequacies within the security systems, such as work discipline and coordination, and emphasized the importance of purging corruption and ending "profit-driven law enforcement." This comes at a time when many local governments are facing financial difficulties. Relevant context includes China's increasing focus on internal security amid global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 14-11 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks with a three-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Ohtani's decisive hit capped off a six-run inning for the Dodgers, completing a 3-for-6, four-RBI performance. The game was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading leads and showcasing explosive offense. Roki Sasaki, making his second MLB start, had a shaky outing, while the Dodgers' offense ultimately secured the win with their late-game heroics.

          <p>Arab countries are focusing on bolstering economic ties with the U.S., particularly in defense, AI, and advanced weaponry, despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE have pledged significant investments in the U.S. ahead of President Trump's visit, with Riyadh offering $600 billion in trade and investment over four years. While a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal is currently unlikely due to the Palestinian issue, discussions regarding a Saudi civil nuclear program and defense cooperation are progressing independently. Analysts speculate that Trump's "very big announcement" during his trip could relate to the Hamas hostages, a potential US-Iran nuclear deal, or the situation with Yemen's Houthis.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a malfunction, is predicted to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact time and location remain uncertain. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus's atmosphere, has a good chance of surviving its descent through Earth's atmosphere, potentially reaching the surface partially intact. While the re-entry poses minimal risk to people on the ground, recovered pieces of the spacecraft legally belong to Russia.</p>

The proposals are expected to include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, potentially restricting visa applications from nationalities with higher overstay rates, and extending the waiting period for migrants to apply for permanent residency. Tougher English language requirements for immigrants and new rules on the recruitment of international care workers are also likely to be highlighted.

          <p>Newly released records from a federal corruption investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams reveal key moments in the case before it was dropped. The investigation, which began in August 2021, focused on the mayor's fundraising and connections to the government of Turkey. Documents suggest federal agents considered seizing Adams's electronic devices and that he may have obstructed efforts to obtain his personal cellphone. The case was dropped after the Trump administration directed the interim U.S. attorney to seek its dismissal, sparking allegations of a quid pro quo.</p>

          <p>Ambassador Peter Mandelson has hailed the recent UK-US trade deal as a "platform for going further and opening up more trade opportunities". The deal reduces or removes tariffs imposed by the US on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminium. While ongoing discussions with the US regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) continue, Mandelson clarified that abolishing the DST was not part of the current trade deal. He noted that Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump have a relationship built on trust and defending their national interests.</p>

The Pakistani military stated it targeted an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in Pathankot and Udhampur using medium-range Fateh missiles. Tensions between the two nations have escalated following an attack in India-controlled Kashmir. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged both parties to de-escalate.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week there was "uncertainty" over the condition of three of the 24 hostages previously believed to be alive. A family told the BBC they hoped the troops would only be used to help with the aim of freeing the hostages, not for any other reasons.</p>

The proclamation calls for deputizing state and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, and other individuals. The administration is also pushing for migrants to leave the country voluntarily through "Project Homecoming," offering financial assistance for self-deportation. Migrants who do not comply could face fines, wage garnishment, and confiscation of property. It is unclear how this effort will be funded.</p>

          <p>The end of the "de minimis" rule, which allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US tax-free, has led to a surge in online shopping and concerns about rising prices. Shoppers rushed to purchase items before the rule change took effect, while businesses warned of potential failures for smaller firms. Economists estimate the change could lead to billions in new costs, disproportionately affecting lower-income households. Some companies are adapting by shifting sales to locally based sellers, but questions remain about the effectiveness of enforcement.</p>

This strategy, however, has its costs, including worsened relations with trading partners and strains on Chinese households.
