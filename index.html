          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before House and Senate committees, facing questions about the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to HHS, which include layoffs and consolidation of institutes. Kennedy defended the cuts as necessary to streamline the department and focus on chronic disease, while Democrats raised concerns about the impact on critical health programs, such as lead poisoning prevention and NIH clinical trials. Kennedy avoided expressing his personal views on vaccines, stating that people should not take medical advice from him, but rather from doctors at the NIH and CDC. He maintained that the CDC is effectively managing the measles outbreak and assured that no funding for life-saving research has been withheld. </p>

The UN's humanitarian chief has urged the Security Council to act to prevent genocide, criticizing Israel's blockade and plans for aid distribution. The situation is compounded by severe shortages of food and fuel, leading to the closure of bakeries and community kitchens, with the UN warning of widespread food insecurity. </p>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a tax bill with almost all tax cuts, including increased child tax credits and standard deductions, set to expire at the end of 2028, just before President Trump's term concludes. This strategy aims to provide immediate financial benefits to Americans while avoiding long-term cost accounting. Some analysts warn that the temporary nature of the cuts could provide only a short-term economic boost, potentially offset by cuts to health care and food assistance. The bill also includes permanent measures, such as lower individual income rates and a tax break for business owners, continuing the architecture of the previous Republican tax cut. </p>

          <p>With inflation declining, interest rate cuts appearing likely, and home equity levels remaining high, now may be an opportune time for homeowners to consider a home equity line of credit (HELOC). HELOCs offer a relatively cheap way to borrow money, but it's essential to assess affordability and avoid overborrowing, as your home serves as collateral. Carefully calculating potential payments under various interest rate scenarios is crucial for ensuring long-term financial stability. A HELOC offers homeowners one of the cheapest ways to borrow money right now. (not investment advice)</p>

Garwin's work was crucial in developing magnetic resonance imaging, high-speed laser printers and later touch-screen monitors. Despite his role in creating the first hydrogen bomb, Garwin expressed that it was not the most important thing in his life and supported verifiable nuclear arms control agreements. He also became known as a voice against President Ronald Reagan’s proposals for a space-based missile system, popularly called Star Wars, to defend the nation against nuclear attack. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to consider the nationwide freeze on President Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, revisiting a long-debated legal theory. The theory, initially promoted by John Eastman and the Claremont Institute, argues that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. This perspective, once considered unorthodox, has gained prominence under Trump, who claims the 14th Amendment is "about slavery". The article traces the theory's journey from academic circles to the Oval Office, highlighting its impact on immigration policies. </p>
