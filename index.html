          <p>Boeing is seeking FAA approval to increase 737 Max production to 42 jets a month as deliveries rise and losses narrow. The company reported a first-quarter net loss of $31 million, an improvement from the previous year, with revenue increasing by 18%. CEO Kelly Ortberg highlighted progress in safety and manufacturing, addressing past accidents like the door plug incident. Boeing is also selling parts of its digital aviation businesses to Thoma Bravo for $10.55 billion to refocus on core operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has accused the Trump administration of "willful and bad faith refusal" to comply with court orders regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a suspected MS-13 gang member. Judge Paula Xinis alleges the administration is obstructing the legal process and withholding information about efforts to return Garcia to the U.S. The Supreme Court previously ordered the administration to facilitate Garcia's return, but officials claim it is up to El Salvador to decide, citing privilege laws to protect information. The Justice Department also released documents detailing domestic violence allegations against Garcia.</p>

Measures include doubling training capacity for driving examiners and reintroducing overtime pay incentives. A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, prompting the government to consult on changes to the booking system.</p>

          <p>The FDA is asking the food industry to voluntarily replace synthetic food dyes with natural alternatives, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals. This move stops short of an outright ban, relying on industry cooperation to make the switch by 2026. The FDA will work with the industry to eliminate six synthetic food dyes and accelerate the approval of new natural color additives. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of synthetic dyes on children's behavior and health, although the food dye industry maintains their safety.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Beradt's "The Third Reich of Dreams" examines the psychological effects of Nazism by documenting the dreams of ordinary Germans during Hitler's rise. These dreams reveal attempts to cope with fear and conform to the regime, exposing a desire for unfreedom as a relief from the burden of freedom. While Beradt interprets these dreams as a sign of succumbing to totalitarianism, they may also represent subconscious warnings and a struggle with moral conscience. The book highlights how authoritarianism can hijack people's brains and infiltrate their deepest thoughts.</p>

          <p>Documentaries promote regenerative agriculture as a solution to climate change by improving soil health and sequestering carbon, however, this approach is overly simplistic and scientifically dubious. While practices like reducing synthetic chemicals, eliminating tillage, planting cover crops, and rotational grazing offer ecological benefits, they also involve tradeoffs. Regenerative agriculture is land-intensive, and claims about carbon sequestration are difficult to verify. Reducing meat and dairy production is a more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, which accounts for up to one-third of global emissions.</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers unveiled their latest electric vehicle models at the Shanghai motor show, aiming to regain ground in the competitive Chinese market. Toyota is displaying its new bZ7 EV model with Huawei's operating system, while Honda is exhibiting the latest version of its Ye EV series with AI technologies from DeepSeek. Nissan revealed its new plug-in hybrid pickup truck Frontier Pro. These moves reflect a strategy of accelerating localization in China through collaboration and adopting locally developed technologies amid a trade war between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>China's plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 remain on track, with large-scale tests proceeding "as scheduled", according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). Component tests have been completed for the crewed lunar mission, including thermal evaluations of the Lanyue lunar lander. The agency is set to conduct the first comprehensive assessments of mission components. The current timeline to land the first humans on the moon this century still placed China’s space programme behind the United States.</p>

          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the US has embraced a more punitive approach, with some advocating for treating fetuses as people and charging women who have abortions with homicide. This shift is reflected in legislation introduced in several states. The movement's focus on fetal personhood has intensified since the overturning of Roe v Wade, with some activists aligning with Republican politicians who prioritize law and order. This has led to a divergence from earlier efforts to support pregnant women and a growing acceptance of extreme views.</p>

The National Advertising Division (NAD) said Apple went too far in touting the availability of AI features that were not yet released. Apple has agreed to discontinue a TV ad called "More Personal Siri" that focused on these unreleased features. This decision is the latest blow to Apple's reputation regarding artificial intelligence technology and its struggles to market the iPhone 16's AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's defiance of court rulings raises questions about the judiciary's power to enforce compliance. While courts have coercive tools, their effectiveness depends on democratic norms and public vigilance. The judiciary can mandate officials to answer questions, impose fines, and even imprison officials, but ultimately relies on the executive branch for enforcement. The president's compliance with court orders is rooted in a political culture that respects the rule of law, requiring public opinion and congressional oversight to ensure accountability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs have created economic uncertainty, driving investors to gold as a safe haven. The price of gold has surged since the announcement of tariffs on U.S. imports, reaching record highs. This increase is due to the stock market's decline and concerns over traditionally safe investments like Treasury bonds and the U.S. dollar. Gold's value is not tied to the U.S. economy and has historically retained its value during economic crises, making it a reliable investment. (not investment advice)</p>

Parents, teachers, and students voiced their support for Melissa Calhoun, arguing she was respecting the student's rights. The district's decision was based on a violation of Florida law, but many argued the teacher acted with compassion. The board ultimately upheld the superintendent's decision despite the strong opposition, leading to frustration among supporters.</p>

          <p>No current members of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet visited the war-linked Yasukuni shrine during a three-day spring festival, partly due to diplomatic considerations. Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the shrine, prompting protests from China and disappointment from South Korea, which view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. This avoidance follows a similar pattern during the autumn festival, reflecting Japan's efforts to thaw relations with neighboring countries after years of tension over wartime history and territorial issues.</p>

Sixty-four percent of respondents expressed greater stress about running out of funds in their golden years. Gen Xers are the most concerned, followed by boomers. High inflation, taxes, and uncertainty over Social Security benefits contribute to these fears. Experts advise seeking professional help to navigate these uncertain times. (not investment advice)</p>
