          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 11:53:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML saw its shares fall by over 11% after releasing its second-quarter earnings. Although the company surpassed current profit and revenue forecasts, it issued a cautious outlook, projecting third-quarter revenue below market expectations and expressing significant uncertainty about its ability to grow in 2026. CEO Christophe Fouquet attributed the conservative forecast to increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical instability, which has tempered optimism despite strong current demand for its advanced chip-making machines from the artificial intelligence industry. This news highlights the broader challenges facing the semiconductor sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior White House official has indicated that President Donald Trump is likely to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell soon, following a meeting where Republican lawmakers reportedly supported the move. This development comes amid ongoing public criticism of Powell by the administration, which seeks to pressure the central bank into lowering interest rates. While some high-ranking Republicans have publicly denied the likelihood of this action, others have fueled speculation on social media. Legally, a president's authority to remove a Fed chair is contested, and Powell himself has previously stated such an action is not permitted under the law.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that significantly surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a powerful performance from its trading divisions. The bank's equities and fixed income trading operations capitalized on market volatility, generating $840 million more in revenue than anticipated. Overall profit increased 22% year-over-year, with total revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. The strong results were also supported by a rebound in investment banking fees, which jumped 26%. The only area of disappointment was the asset and wealth management division, which saw a slight revenue decline compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has suspended several Members of Parliament for defying the party line and rebelling against proposed government welfare cuts. A total of 47 Labour MPs voted against the cuts, undermining Starmer's authority at a time when it was already perceived as weakened by recent policy reversals. The suspended MPs, including Rachael Maskell and others newly elected, defended their actions by stating their primary duty is to represent their constituents' interests, particularly opposing measures that would impoverish disabled people. They expressed their continued commitment to Labour values despite the disciplinary action from the party leadership.</p>

          <p>The United States has called for a thorough investigation into the death of Saif Mussallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American, who was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee labeled the event a "criminal and terrorist act" and demanded accountability. Mussallet's family stated he was attacked while protecting his family's land and that medical assistance was blocked from reaching him for hours. The incident occurs amid rising violence in the region, with the UN noting a significant increase in settler attacks on Palestinians this year, prompting calls for Israel to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>ProPublica climate reporter Abrahm Lustgarten has characterized the recent severe floods in Texas as an "early warning" of the chaotic and destructive weather events to come. In his analysis, Lustgarten highlights the grave risks posed by the combination of increasingly erratic weather patterns and political decisions that undermine scientific institutions. He argues that budget cuts to crucial agencies like FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are particularly dangerous. Lustgarten's perspective suggests that these factors are creating a perfect storm, making the nation more vulnerable to future climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new seven-year budget framework totaling 2 trillion euros, which includes a significant fivefold increase in funding for defense and space initiatives. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the proposal allocates 131 billion euros to these areas, framing it as a "budget for the realities of today." The plan also dedicates about 35% of funds to climate and biodiversity projects. To finance this, the EU aims to introduce new revenue streams, such as duties on tobacco and e-waste, while keeping member state contributions unchanged. The proposal requires approval from the European Parliament and member states.</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein has created significant turmoil within the MAGA movement, escalating after the Department of Justice announced no further files would be released and that no "client list" existed. This timeline traces the events from Epstein's 2019 arrest to the present, detailing President Trump's shifting stance, from initially vowing to declassify files to later pleading with his supporters to drop the issue. The DoJ's decision sparked outrage among right-wing commentators and supporters, who accused the administration of a cover-up. This has led to a rare instance of public disagreement and criticism directed at the Trump administration from within its own base.</p>

The comments highlight a growing rift within the Republican party over the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files, which many of his supporters believe contain evidence of a wider conspiracy.

However, data from Detrie's Fitbit showed minimal movement during the time of the murder, corroborating his alibi that he was at home asleep. This technological evidence, combined with DNA from an unidentified male on the victim's clothing, led to Detrie's release and the eventual identification and charging of another man, George Burch, whose phone data placed him at the crime scenes.</p>

Analysts suggest this indicates that recent diplomatic efforts are beginning to yield tangible results and steer relations in a more constructive direction.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of devastating floods in Texas, the Texas National Guard's recovery efforts have been bolstered by the arrival of a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic. The team, consisting of sixteen civilians and four cadaver dogs, is assisting in the search for approximately 100 people who remain missing. This international cooperation is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, which has linked Texas with the Czech Republic since 1993. The Guard itself has been instrumental in the response, rescuing over 500 people, including 130 children evacuated from a flooded summer camp.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most significant measles outbreak in over 30 years, with more than 1,300 cases confirmed across at least 39 states in 2025. A major driver of this surge is a large outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the rise in this highly contagious and preventable disease to declining vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold needed for community immunity. In response, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly encouraged people to get the measles vaccine while maintaining his opposition to government mandates.</p>

The skeleton, buried just beneath the stone, is believed to be that of a man about 40 years old at the time of his death.

CEO Ted Pick highlighted the consistent earnings over the past six quarters as evidence of the firm's ability to perform well across different market environments.

          <p>Three Democratic senators have raised alarms about a new searchable citizenship database developed by the Trump administration, fearing it could lead to the disenfranchisement of eligible voters. The system, an upgrade to the existing SAVE platform, links immigration and Social Security data, allowing election officials to check the citizenship status of people on voter rolls. In a letter to DHS, the senators expressed concern about the system's accuracy, the lack of public transparency in its rollout, and the potential for misuse. They noted that while the administration has not briefed Congress, it did privately brief a Trump-aligned group known for promoting election fraud narratives.</p>

          <p>When planning for retirement, individuals often face a choice between investment vehicles like 401(k) plans and insurance products like annuities. A 401(k) offers growth potential and flexibility, allowing pre-tax or Roth contributions to be invested in markets, though this exposes the saver to market risk. In contrast, an annuity provides a guaranteed income stream, shifting risk to an insurance company but often coming with higher fees and less flexibility. For many, the optimal strategy is not a binary choice but a hybrid approach, using a 401(k) for growth during one's career and then converting a portion to an annuity for a stable income floor in retirement.
