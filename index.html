          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence after four people died during a tour she led on the Western Cleddau river in Wales. The victims, Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley, were part of a group paddleboarding in hazardous conditions in October 2021. Lloyd, an ex-police officer, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour and disregarded health and safety protocols. The court heard that the river was in flood conditions, and the group encountered a dangerous weir with a strong current, leading to the tragic incident. Optimism score: 10</p>

          <p>The European Union has levied fines totaling €700 million on Apple and Meta for non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act, a law aimed at curbing the power of large tech companies.

          <p>Moira Donegan critiques the pro-natalism movement, particularly the Collins couple who are advising the Trump administration on increasing American birth rates. Donegan argues that the movement's proposals, such as fertility awareness classes and 'baby bonuses,' are not genuinely aimed at supporting mothers or addressing their needs. Instead, she asserts that the pro-natalist agenda seeks to enforce regressive social roles for women, limiting their opportunities beyond motherhood and promoting a white-centric vision of the future. She criticizes liberal thinkers for ceding cultural ground to the pro-natalists by focusing solely on the affordability of children, thereby reinforcing the notion that women's primary role is motherhood.

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for his stance on transgender issues, accusing him of lacking 'moral courage.' This follows a UK Supreme Court ruling that defined 'woman' based on biological sex under equalities law. Badenoch likened Starmer to a 'weather vane,' suggesting he avoids taking a firm position. Starmer's spokesman later clarified that the prime minister does not believe transgender women are women, contrasting with previous statements. Optimism score: 50</p>
