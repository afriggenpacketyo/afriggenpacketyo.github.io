          <h2>Bank of Japan Holds Steady Amid Trump Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>The Bank of Japan maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, acknowledging the potential impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Japan's economic outlook. While headline inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, giving the central bank flexibility to raise rates, Trump's tariffs have complicated these plans. The central bank stated it would continue to raise the policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized, while also flagging that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to global slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. The Nikkei 225 rose following the decision, while the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the UK's challenges in trade negotiations with the U.S. under President Trump, highlighting the futility of appeasement. It suggests that despite the UK's efforts to align with Trump's demands, it is being placed behind other nations in trade talks. The article draws parallels with other entities that have found Trump's demands increase with each concession. It also contrasts Britain's approach with that of Canada, which is taking a more assertive stance against the U.S., suggesting that belligerence yields better results with Trump. The article questions whether Britain's diplomatic efforts are effective or simply reflect an abusive relationship dynamic.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a Stoke-on-Trent firm known for its colorful pottery, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company's directors cited rising costs and falling sales as contributing factors to the closure. Moorcroft, which has been based at its current site since 1913, had a long history of royal patronage and was popular with U.S. presidents and British prime ministers. The closure is another blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, following the recent collapse of Royal Stafford and other firms in the sector.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is seen as an attempt to improve relations with the EU amidst global uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs. The sanctions, imposed in 2021 after the EU sanctioned Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, had stalled a trade and investment deal between the EU and China. While the EU welcomes the lifting of sanctions, it maintains its concerns about human rights in China. Experts suggest that China's move is aimed at paving the way for trade discussions with the EU, particularly as it seeks new export markets amid the US-China trade tensions.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article argues that the U.S. military, despite its advanced technology, lacks the necessary quantity of personnel and materiel to fight a major war. It points to the shrinking naval fleet and aging aircraft as evidence that the military is only equipped for short conflicts. The article highlights the demands of modern warfare, citing the situations in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen, to demonstrate the need for increased resources. It suggests that the Pentagon should prioritize resources that directly strengthen combat power, such as active service members, ammunition, new ships, and new aircraft, and that the government should increase its demand for ammunition to incentivize defense companies to produce more.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris delivered a sharp critique of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, warning of a "wholesale abandonment of America's highest ideals." Speaking to Democrats in San Francisco, the former vice-president praised those pushing back against Trump's agenda and urged Americans to organize and stand up for fundamental rights. She accused Trump of sowing fear and chaos to consolidate executive power and said that the chaotic start to Trump's second term was by design, laid out in the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's trade war, calling it the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history."

          <p>European auto giants reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profit, and many suspended or cut full-year financial guidance, partially attributing the industry pain to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Stellantis and Mercedes scrapped their 2025 earnings guidance. Volkswagen said it expects operating return on sales, net cash flow and net liquidity to come in at the bottom end of its annual forecasts, citing increasing trade restrictions, political uncertainty and emissions regulations. The fast-changing nature of Trump's trade tariffs will likely keep any long-term corporate investment decisions at bay.</p>
