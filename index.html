          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump wrote a personal letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to act for peace to protect children and future generations. The letter, which describes children's dreams of safety and the duty of leaders to guard their innocence, was reportedly hand-delivered by Donald Trump before their summit in Alaska. The appeal framed the protection of children as a cause that transcends politics and ideology, suggesting President Putin could singlehandedly restore hope for many. This action occurred just before the high-stakes meeting aimed at discussing an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, making it the first of the 2025 season to reach this level of severity. With maximum sustained winds near 160 mph, the hurricane's outer bands are currently impacting the northern Leeward Islands. While tropical storm watches are in effect for several islands, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the storm's core to remain at sea. The forecast track shows Erin curving northward, keeping it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast, though residents in the Caribbean are warned of potential flooding and landslides.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles cricket team set a new record for the highest-ever score in The Hundred competition, reaching 226-4 in a decisive victory over Welsh Fire. The dominant performance was led by Jordan Cox, who scored an explosive 86 not out from only 29 balls, including ten sixes. This display of power hitting secured an 83-run win and propelled the two-time defending champions to the top of the league table based on their superior net run-rate. The match also broke the record for the most sixes hit in a single game in the competition's history.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has stepped in to halt a strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants, ordering binding arbitration just hours after the labor action began. The strike, initiated by the Canadian Union of Public Employees over disputes regarding wages and unpaid work, had already caused hundreds of flight cancellations, affecting an estimated 130,000 passengers daily. Canada's labor minister stated the intervention was necessary to preserve national stability and supply chains. The airline anticipates it could take up to ten days to return to its regular flight schedule following the disruption.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has formally requested that the UK government evacuate sick and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment without delay. In a letter to senior ministers, they highlighted the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and the imminent risk of death for many children due to the ongoing conflict and blockade. The MPs are collaborating with the charity Médecins Sans Frontières to facilitate the process, calling for adequate funding and for evacuees to have the option to claim asylum. The government has stated that plans are being accelerated to bring a few hundred children to the UK.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced an immediate halt to the issuance of all medical-humanitarian visitor visas for people from Gaza. The agency stated it is conducting a comprehensive review of the program's procedures, which has allowed a small number of individuals, primarily critically injured children and their families, to enter the U.S. for treatment. The decision was praised by some far-right activists but condemned by humanitarian groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which called the policy cruel and warned it would endanger children's lives. It remains unclear how long the suspension will last.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with an impressive 3-0 victory against West Ham, securing their first top-flight win in the month of August since 2010.

The decisive win at home sparked celebrations among fans who have endured an eight-year absence from the league. The performance showcased the potential of the club's new signings, including veteran midfielder Granit Xhaka, suggesting the team may defy predictions of a quick return to the Championship.</p>

          <p>Six prominent Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, have publicly called on President Trump to reverse his decision allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI chips to China. The deal permits the sales in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of the revenue. In an open letter, the senators expressed serious alarm that the arrangement trades away America's competitive technological edge and could strengthen China's military capabilities. The Trump administration dismissed the concerns, while reports suggest China is already urging its domestic tech firms to avoid purchasing the U.S. chips.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin's explosive growth into a Category 5 storm is a prime example of a phenomenon known as rapid intensification, where wind speeds increase by over 58 mph in just 24 hours. Meteorologists explain that a combination of factors, including low wind shear and a path over exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit, created perfect conditions for this strengthening. Climate change is making such events more common by heating the oceans, which act as fuel for hurricanes. This rapid development complicates forecasting and emergency planning, as storms can become dangerously powerful with very little warning.</p>

          <p>Millions of current and former AT&T customers are now eligible to file claims for a share of a $177 million settlement following two major data breaches.

Impacted individuals can claim up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the incidents, pending final court approval of the settlement in December 2025. Notices are being sent to eligible customers, who must submit their claims by November 18, 2025.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old billionaire CEO who founded healthcare software giant Epic Systems in 1979 and has maintained its private ownership ever since. Faulkner has built the company, which holds a dominant 42% market share in U.S. hospital electronic health records, on a set of principles that include never going public or being acquired. Known for her unique blend of technical acumen and eccentric campus culture, she has created a succession plan to ensure the company remains privately held in a trust after her death. She has also pledged to donate 99% of her personal wealth to charity.</p>

          <h2>Immigration Arrests Declined in July Following Activist-Led Resistance Efforts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 11:38:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests conducted by ICE saw a 13% decrease in July compared to the previous month, a slowdown that activists believe may be partly due to their efforts. In states like Oregon, a "rapid response" system run by non-profits uses a hotline to track ICE activity and quickly provide legal aid to those detained, sometimes preventing their transfer to out-of-state detention centers. This legal resistance, combined with Oregon's "sanctuary" law limiting local police cooperation with federal agents, complicates ICE's operations. The agency has previously cited a need for more officers and detention space to meet its enforcement goals.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics. At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Thompson ran a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record and narrowly beating Lyles, who finished second in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second. The win establishes Thompson as a strong contender for the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, while Lyles viewed his performance as a positive step in his preparations.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area south of Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him in a space behind the cascade. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a rescue team located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>
