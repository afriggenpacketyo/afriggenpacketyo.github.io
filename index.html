          <h2>Trump Administration Terminates More Immigration Judges Amid Deportation Push</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired another fifteen immigration judges, continuing a trend of dismissals over the last six months. The terminations, which were delivered without specific reasons, come as the judges reached the end of their two-year probationary periods with the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review. This action occurs despite Congress allocating funds to hire more judges to address a backlog of nearly four million cases, drawing criticism from the judges' union for undermining immigration law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing calls to U.S. poison centers found that while these products are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which is highly toxic to children. The study highlights that these incidents, often involving flavored products in colorful packaging, are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes compared to other nicotine products.</p>

          <p>Investment bank Morgan Stanley has downgraded cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike's stock from "overweight" to "equal weight," suggesting it's time for investors to "take a breather." Analysts argue that despite the company's strong position and AI potential, its current high valuation fully reflects lofty expectations for future growth, leaving little room for near-term gains. The stock, which has risen 50% since April, now trades at a significant premium compared to other large software companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirty-five years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), prospective parents with disabilities continue to face discriminatory barriers in the adoption process. This article highlights the story of a couple, both of whom have spina bifida, who were initially rejected by an adoption agency due to their condition. While the ADA prohibits such discrimination, its application in adoption services is not always guaranteed, revealing an ongoing struggle for equal access and challenging outdated perceptions about the capabilities of parents with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee has threatened to sue North Carolina's state board of elections over a plan that could purge nearly 100,000 voters from the rolls. The Republican-majority board voted to require voters to cast provisional ballots if certain identification numbers are missing from their registration, a move the DNC argues is unconstitutional and violates the National Voter Registration Act. This legal threat escalates the political battle over voting rights in the key battleground state ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has suggested that President Trump's tariff policies have not caused significant price inflation because of a surge in "patriotism." He theorized that Trump's leadership has successfully encouraged Americans to buy domestic products, thereby reducing demand for imports so much that it has offset any price increases from the tariffs. This explanation has been met with skepticism from other economists, who point to different factors for the muted price effects. (not investment advice)</p>
