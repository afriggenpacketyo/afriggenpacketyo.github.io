        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a major budget bill championed by President Trump could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing health insurance coverage. The legislation, which narrowly passed a procedural vote in the Senate, is also projected to increase the national debt by almost $3.3 trillion over the next decade. These figures are complicating Republican efforts to pass the bill, as some party members, like Senator Thom Tillis, have expressed strong reservations about its significant cuts to healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Democrats have heavily criticized the plan, framing it as a measure that provides tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of essential health services for low-income and disabled Americans.

          <p>Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, has declared that his country's uranium enrichment activities will never cease, asserting it as an inalienable right for peaceful purposes under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. His statement comes in the wake of recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a context he claims is not conducive to new negotiations. Iravani also denied that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in Iran face any threats, despite acknowledging that their access to nuclear sites has been suspended by parliament. The declaration signals a defiant stance amid international pressure for renewed diplomatic talks and verification of Iran's nuclear intentions.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has issued an apology after mistakenly informing thousands of Eurojackpot players that they had won millions more than their actual prizes. The error occurred during a currency conversion from Euros to Norwegian kroner, where the amount was incorrectly multiplied instead of divided. While no customers were paid the incorrect, inflated amounts, the incident caused significant public anger and disappointment. In the aftermath of the mistake, Norsk Tipping CEO Tonje Sagstuen announced her resignation, accepting responsibility for the error and the series of technical issues that have plagued the company over the past year.</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner of Virginia has alleged that the Trump administration issued an 'explicit' threat to the University of Virginia (UVA), warning of severe cuts to jobs, research funding, and student aid if its president, Jim Ryan, did not resign. Ryan, who had supported diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies opposed by the administration, stepped down on Friday, citing an unwillingness to risk the university's funding and the welfare of its staff and students. Warner condemned the action as an outrageous overreach into education, suggesting it sets a dangerous precedent for other public universities. The incident is part of a broader federal investigation into DEI policies at multiple academic institutions.</p>

          <p>New high-resolution satellite images from Maxar Technologies show continued activity at Iran's underground Fordow uranium enrichment facility following recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes. The imagery reveals an excavator, personnel, and vehicles near a northern shaft, suggesting repair or assessment efforts are underway. The photos also confirm significant damage, including the destruction of a nearby facility and large craters on access routes, which analysts believe was intended to hinder repairs. While the U.S. and Israel state the strikes were meant to impede Iran's nuclear weapons development, the ongoing activity indicates the program has not been completely halted, though its progress has been significantly disrupted.</p>

These oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-6 fatty acids. While some critics link high consumption of these fats to inflammation and chronic diseases, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations disagree. They argue that when substituted for saturated fats, seed oils can lower LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, stating that the evidence does not support the widespread claims of their toxicity.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered Palestinians to evacuate parts of northern Gaza, including areas in Gaza City and Jabalia, ahead of an intensified military campaign. This escalation comes as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The Hamas-run health ministry reported at least 86 fatalities in the 24 hours leading up to Sunday, including three children killed in a strike on al-Mawasi, an area previously designated as a safe zone. While mediators are working to broker a new truce, the renewed military action and ongoing casualties underscore the immense difficulty in achieving a lasting resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is affecting large parts of Europe, prompting health warnings and setting new temperature records. Southern Spain has been hit hardest, with one town recording 46Â°C (115Â°F), a new national record for June. Red heat warnings are active in Portugal, Italy, and Croatia, while numerous other countries are under amber alerts. The extreme heat has strained emergency services, with a rise in heatstroke cases reported, and has been linked to at least one death in Barcelona. This event is part of a trend of more frequent and intense heatwaves, which scientists attribute to climate change, with temperatures expected to continue rising in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection, a decision that came shortly after he was publicly attacked by President Trump. The criticism followed Tillis's vote against advancing the president's major tax and spending bill, which Tillis argued would be financially devastating for his state's healthcare system. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, suggesting that many politicians are more motivated by raw politics than by the needs of their constituents. His departure opens up a competitive race for his Senate seat in a key swing state.</p>

          <p>Assessing the true damage from the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities is a complex task that early reports may oversimplify, according to an analysis of battle damage assessment (BDA) history. While President Trump declared the program 'obliterated,' BDA is a meticulous process integrating imagery, intelligence, and an understanding of weapon effects that takes time. The analysis argues that given the advanced B-2 bombers, powerful GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs, and years of intelligence on the targets, the strikes were likely highly effective and caused severe, lasting damage. This expert judgment suggests the administration's assessment is closer to reality than preliminary, hastily leaked reports indicating minimal impact.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a U.S. ban over national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that a group of 'very wealthy people' is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes as the president has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law mandating the sale, with the latest deadline now set for September 17, creating new uncertainty around the app's future in the United States.</p>

          <p>A gold mine collapse in a government-controlled area of Sudan has killed at least 11 miners and injured seven others, a state-owned company reported. The incident occurred in an artisanal shaft at the Kirsh al-Fil mine, which the company said it had previously closed due to significant safety risks. Such collapses are common in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which suffers from poor safety standards. The gold industry is a major source of funding for both sides in Sudan's brutal civil war, with much of the gold reportedly smuggled out of the country to finance the conflict.</p>

The U.S. district attorney's office is examining activity believed to be related to the 2023-24 season, when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks. The NBA has confirmed it is cooperating with the investigation. This probe follows the league's lifetime ban of Jontay Porter for a similar prop betting scandal, highlighting the growing scrutiny on player gambling as sports betting becomes more integrated with professional leagues.

          <p>According to a Washington Post report citing U.S. intelligence, intercepted communications from Iranian officials have downplayed the extent of the damage from recent U.S. strikes on their nuclear facilities. This account contrasts with President Trump's declaration that the program was 'obliterated' but aligns with a leaked preliminary assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency suggesting a more limited setback. While the White House dismissed the report as 'nonsense,' the intercepts raise questions about the true impact of the attack and whether Iran is attempting to project strength.

          <p>The United States is dangerously behind in the strategic competition for rare earth elements, leaving its commercial and defense sectors exposed to Chinese geopolitical leverage, an op-ed argues. China's dominance, controlling over 90% of refining capacity, allows it to weaponize supply chains, as seen with recent export controls. Despite years of warnings, U.S. efforts to build independent supply chains have been slow and incoherent, hampered by permitting delays and a lack of sustained, bipartisan strategy. The article asserts that unless the U.S. treats these critical minerals as instruments of national power and builds a complete, resilient supply chain with allies, it will remain vulnerable to Chinese industrial policy.
