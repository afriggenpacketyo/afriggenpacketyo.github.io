            <p>China's exports experienced a significant jump of 12.4% in March, driven by businesses accelerating shipments to the U.S. before anticipated tariff increases took effect. However, imports declined by 4.3%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. Analysts predict that this surge is temporary, with exports expected to weaken in the coming months due to the escalated trade war between the U.S. and China. The U.S. has imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China, leading to uncertainty in supply chains and potential inflationary pressures in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Aimee Lou Wood, star of The White Lotus, has criticized a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that parodied her, calling it "mean and unfunny." Wood took issue with the sketch's use of exaggerated prosthetic teeth and the focus on her appearance, suggesting it was misogynistic. She acknowledged that SNL is about caricature but felt the sketch "punched down" on her. Wood's comments sparked a broader discussion about the portrayal of women's appearances in comedy.</p>

            <p>China's exports rose by 12.4% in March as companies rushed to ship goods before anticipated increases in U.S. tariffs. Imports, however, fell by 4.3%, resulting in a significant trade surplus. Analysts predict that this export surge is likely a temporary phenomenon, with shipments expected to decline in the coming months due to the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. The surge in exports suggests that businesses are attempting to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs by frontloading shipments.</p>
