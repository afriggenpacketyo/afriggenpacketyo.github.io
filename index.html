          <p>In her first major public address since losing the 2024 election, former Vice President Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's economic policies, particularly his tariffs, labeling them as "reckless" and the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history." She argued that these tariffs hurt workers and families by increasing the cost of essential goods and hindering business growth, potentially leading to a recession. Harris also touched on Trump's immigration policies, condemning the detention and deportation of American citizens without due process. The article also mentioned that Harris may be considering a run for California governor in 2026.</p>
