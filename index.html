          <p>The UK government is planning significant road safety reforms, including mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70. This proposal follows a coroner's report calling the UK's licensing system one of Europe's laxest. The new strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's stricter standard. Other potential changes include introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers and simplifying drug-driving prosecutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, the article explains that newly formed ones emit a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. When a black hole is created, for instance from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in space-time vibrates and settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. These vibrations, known as quasinormal modes, are like pure tones that scientists can detect and study. This phenomenon offers a way to observe the otherwise imperceptible final moments of a black hole's formation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three years old. The initiative is an expansion of pilot programs already active in over 20 provinces. Analysts suggest the subsidy's impact will be most significant in less affluent regions where the handout represents a larger percentage of average income. For example, the subsidy is over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in Gansu province, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates in rural areas.</p>

This arrangement applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export restrictions.

          <p>Danone U.S. has initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of its YoCrunch yogurt products because of potential contamination with plastic pieces in the dome toppers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that the transparent plastic shards, some with sharp edges, could pose a choking hazard if consumed. The recall applies to products with expiration dates from July through September. The article notes this incident highlights broader concerns about the health risks associated with plastic packaging in the food supply.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, strengthening his case for the backup role. Lance completed seven of fourteen passes but made his biggest impact with his legs, rushing seven times for 48 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, competing quarterback Taylor Heinicke struggled in his first preseason action. The Chargers' defense also shined, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>

          <p>A rapidly growing wildfire in western Colorado, known as the Lee Fire, has burned over 167 square miles, becoming the sixth-largest in the state's history. The blaze prompted the precautionary evacuation of all 179 incarcerated individuals from the Rifle Correctional Center. Fueled by dry conditions and gusty winds, the fire has forced evacuations in several mountain communities and led to air quality warnings. Over a thousand firefighters are battling the blaze, which currently has very low containment.</p>
