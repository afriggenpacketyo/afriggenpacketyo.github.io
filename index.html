        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has confirmed the company eliminated 4,000 customer support positions, reducing the department from 9,000 to 5,000 employees. Benioff directly attributed the layoffs to the increased efficiency provided by artificial intelligence, stating, "I need less heads." The company's AI-driven "Agentforce" has reportedly decreased the number of support cases, making many support engineer roles redundant. While some analysts suggest AI is being used as a pretext for layoffs after over-hiring during the pandemic, the move highlights a growing trend of AI impacting jobs across various industries and the increasing pressure on workers to adapt their skills.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift joined the festivities for Brittany Mahomes' 30th birthday, which was celebrated with a cowgirl-themed weekend in Nashville. Mahomes shared a series of photos on social media, including one of her and Swift enjoying cocktails, highlighting their close friendship that has grown since Swift began dating Travis Kelce. The event underscores the strong bond between the two, who have frequently been seen together at Kansas City Chiefs games. The celebration comes shortly after Swift and Kelce announced their engagement, an event for which Mahomes had previously shared her public congratulations and support for the couple.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), has stated it cannot confidently verify the government's £850 million cost estimate for a relocation plan following a major data breach. The breach exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to move to the UK to flee the Taliban. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) created a new secret scheme, the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR), to resettle those at risk, but the NAO found the MoD failed to separately track its costs. This lack of clear accounting makes it impossible to determine the true expense of the resettlement efforts.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled against the Department of Justice's demand for Google to sell its Chrome web browser as part of a landmark antitrust case. While Google can retain Chrome and its Android operating system, the company is now barred from entering into exclusive default search engine contracts and must share certain search data with its competitors. The ruling addresses Google's monopolistic practices of paying billions to companies like Apple to ensure its search engine is the default on their devices. The decision acknowledges the changing landscape of online search with the rise of AI, aiming to restore competition without dismantling key parts of Google's operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council for ownership of Hopwood Hall, his ancestral home in Greater Manchester. DePree claims he fulfilled a 2017 agreement that gave him the option to purchase the historic, crumbling building after he spent seven years and £750,000 of his own money on its restoration. However, the council argues he did not meet all conditions, including providing a commercially viable business model, and locked him out of the property in November 2024. DePree, who documented his efforts in the book "Downton Shabby," is now seeking a legal declaration that he is the rightful owner.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to host a major military parade in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un among the most prominent attendees. The event is expected to be a significant display of China's military capabilities, featuring troops, fighter jets, and advanced equipment. The presence of Putin and Kim alongside President Xi Jinping is seen as a strategic move to project a unified front and bolster China's leadership role on the global stage. The gathering highlights shifting geopolitical alliances, with only one EU leader, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, expected to attend.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Power and the Palace" by Valentine Low, details a number of previously private stories about the British royal family's interactions with the political world. Among the most striking claims is an account of Queen Camilla, as a teenager in the 1960s, fighting off a sexual assault on a train and having the perpetrator arrested. The book also asserts that the late Queen Elizabeth II was privately in favor of remaining in the European Union, viewing it as part of the post-war stability she supported. Other anecdotes include political figures' late-night drinks with King Charles on the royal train and tense negotiations over the funding of the monarchy.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B in a $24 million lawsuit brought by a former security guard, Emani Ellis, who accused the artist of assault in 2018. Ellis alleged that Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, spat on her and cut her cheek with a fingernail at a Beverly Hills medical building, causing lasting harm. Cardi B testified that Ellis had been following and filming her while she was trying to maintain the privacy of her pregnancy. The jury sided with the rapper, who will not have to pay any damages, concluding a trial that had gained attention for her candid testimony.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, shooting lava fountains up to 330 feet into the air from its Halemaʻumaʻu summit crater. This marks the 32nd eruptive episode since the current activity began in December 2024, with all lava flows so far being contained within the crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma is accumulating in a lower chamber before being forced to the surface, creating spectacular but currently contained lava displays. While the eruption poses no immediate threat to surrounding communities, its future behavior remains unpredictable, drawing both scientific interest and visitor attention.</p>

          <p>The Safer Living Foundation, a unique UK charity in Nottingham credited with significantly reducing reoffending rates among sex offenders, has been forced to close due to a lack of funding. The organization provided a supportive community environment for individuals convicted of sexual crimes after their release from prison, a method that saw only a 2% recidivism rate among its participants compared to the national average of 15.1%. The closure highlights the societal and financial challenges of funding rehabilitation programs for this reviled group, despite evidence that such support can be highly effective in preventing future victims.

          <p>Investors responded positively to a federal judge's ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google, causing parent company Alphabet's stock to jump 8% in extended trading. The market's relief stems from the decision to not force Google to sell its lucrative Chrome browser or Android operating system, which were the most severe penalties sought by the Department of Justice. While the court found Google held an illegal monopoly in internet search, the remedies were viewed as manageable. The ruling imposes limits on Google's exclusive distribution contracts but avoids a structural breakup, a result that investors see as a significant victory for the tech giant.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to take sufficient action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors. The legislation seeks to hold accountable Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures, such as "know-your-customer" procedures, to prevent the flow of these synthetic opioids. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Barr, the bill targets the source of the chemicals used to produce the deadly drug. While supporters emphasize the need to attack the crisis at its origin, some Democrats noted that sanctions alone are not enough and stressed the importance of diplomacy and international law enforcement cooperation.</p>

The judge found the action to be a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits using the military for domestic policing. The opinion details how the administration attempted to create a "constitutional exception" to justify the deployment, a legal argument Breyer dismissed as not grounded in history, jurisprudence, or common sense. This ruling rebukes the administration's expansive view of presidential power and blocks further such deployments in California, setting a precedent for potential future conflicts.</p>

His victory raises questions about the Green Party's future direction, as his brash, left-wing approach contrasts with the more moderate tone of the party's existing MPs from rural constituencies.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has started its verdict deliberations in the historic trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of orchestrating a coup plot to unlawfully retain power after his 2022 election defeat. The prosecution alleges that Bolsonaro and seven others formed a criminal association aiming to violently overthrow the democratic order, culminating in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters. If convicted, the right-wing populist could face a prison sentence of over 40 years. Presiding Justice Alexandre de Moraes has described the plot as an attempt to establish a dictatorship, emphasizing that the court will remain inflexible in defending Brazil's democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently made repeated claims that he has ended six or seven wars during his time in office, suggesting he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts. A review of the conflicts cited by the White House—including those between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and India and Pakistan—reveals a more complex reality. While the Trump administration has been involved in brokering ceasefires and normalizing relations in several instances, foreign policy experts note that many of these disputes were not full-scale wars and remain largely unresolved. The article suggests that while some credit is due for diplomatic efforts, declaring these long-standing conflicts as fully "settled" is a premature assessment.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights significant variations in take-home winnings based on state taxes. Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest post-tax payouts, while those in high-tax states like New York would see their winnings reduced the most. The odds of winning the jackpot remain 1 in 292.2 million. The data also identifies "hot" and "cold" numbers over the last 100 drawings, though each draw is a random event. This will be the 41st drawing since the jackpot was last won in May.</p>

          <p>The recent arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan in Britain has intensified the debate over free speech and hate speech laws in Europe. Linehan, known for his vocal criticism of transgender activism, was arrested on suspicion of "inciting violence" for a social media post. This incident is presented as symptomatic of a broader trend where illiberal hate-speech laws, intended to protect minorities, are being selectively enforced, granting police significant discretionary power. Critics argue that such laws are creating a "chill" on free expression and are sometimes used by opposing groups to weaponize the legal system against each other, leading to a perception of two-tiered justice.</p>

          <p>Jim Walden, an independent candidate in the New York City mayoral race, has suspended his campaign and is calling on his rivals to consolidate behind a single candidate to defeat Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani. In his withdrawal statement, Walden warned that Mamdani represents a "Trojan Horse" and implored other candidates trailing in the polls to put aside personal ambition to prevent his election. Walden, an attorney who positioned himself as a technocrat in the mold of Michael Bloomberg, struggled to gain traction in a crowded field that includes incumbent Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. His call for a unified front has so far not been accepted by the other campaigns.</p>

          <p>Relations between Australia and Israel have deteriorated significantly, marked by public rebukes, visa cancellations, and accusations of political interference. The rift intensified after Australia announced its intention to conditionally recognize a Palestinian state, a move Prime Minister Albanese said was partly motivated by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's "denial" of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In response, Netanyahu accused Albanese of fueling antisemitism. Despite the high-level diplomatic fallout, critics and pro-Palestinian advocates in Australia argue that it is largely symbolic, as business, including the supply of Australian parts for Israeli F-35 fighter jets, continues as usual behind the scenes.</p>

          <p>One California Plaza, a 42-story skyscraper on Bunker Hill, has been placed into receivership after its owners defaulted on a $300 million debt. The building's value has plummeted by 74% from its peak, now appraised at just $121.2 million, reflecting the severe challenges facing the downtown Los Angeles office market. With occupancy at 62% and major tenants departing, the property's financial struggles are emblematic of a broader trend where remote work, elevated interest rates, and public safety concerns have devalued commercial real estate. This situation highlights the risk of significant lost property tax revenue for the city, prompting discussions about converting underused office towers into housing. (not investment advice)</p>

Among the missing hardware are two sixth-generation stealth fighter jets, currently in the test flight phase.

          <p>In a contributor piece, a recently retired command sergeant major with nearly three decades of service expresses deep concern over the deployment of armed National Guard soldiers in civilian spaces like the Washington, D.C. subway. Drawing parallels to his experiences in conflict zones like Baghdad, he argues that such patrols erode the crucial trust between the military and the public. He warns that using young, combat-trained soldiers for domestic policing in complex urban environments, where they may encounter individuals in crisis, creates a high-risk situation. The author fears that normalizing military presence on American streets undermines the democratic principles the armed forces are meant to defend.</p>

The filing portrays Trump's move as a pretext, suggesting the true motive is to pressure the Federal Reserve into lowering interest rates, thereby threatening the central bank's independence.
