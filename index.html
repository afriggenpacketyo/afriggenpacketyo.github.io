          <p>Alpine has announced that Franco Colapinto will replace Jack Doohan in their Formula 1 lineup for the next five races, starting immediately. This decision comes after a review of the season's opening races, with Alpine seeking to evaluate its driver options thoroughly. Flavio Briatore, Alpine's executive advisor, emphasized the importance of assessing drivers fairly, particularly with the 2026 season in mind. Doohan remains an integral part of the team and will serve as the first-choice reserve driver during this period, as Alpine prepares for an important season in 2026.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the shifting military alliances of India and Pakistan, with India increasing its reliance on Western military support and Pakistan turning to China. This change is injecting superpower politics into the long-standing conflict between the two nations, increasing the risk of escalation. The United States has cultivated India as a partner against China, while Beijing supports Pakistan as India aligns with the U.S. This evolving dynamic raises concerns about potential miscalculations and the dangers of a military confrontation in the region.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden, in his first interview since leaving the White House, accused Donald Trump of “modern-day appeasement” in his approach to Russia, particularly regarding Ukraine. Biden expressed fears that Europe would lose confidence in America's leadership and said Trump's stance of potentially ceding territory to Russia was misguided. He also condemned Trump's remarks about reclaiming the Panama Canal and acquiring Greenland, calling them uncharacteristic of an American president. Biden defended his own record on Ukraine, stating he provided the country with the necessary support for its independence.</p>
