          <p>During Bryan Kohberger's sentencing for the murder of four University of Idaho students, survivors and victims' relatives delivered powerful impact statements directly to him in court. Surviving roommates described their ongoing trauma and grief, while family members expressed the profound emptiness left by their loved ones' deaths. The emotional hearing provided a platform for those most affected by the tragedy to share their pain after Kohberger pleaded guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal from all U.S. flu shots. This decision follows a recommendation from a recently reconstituted government vaccine panel and formalizes a long-standing goal of the anti-vaccine movement. While health experts express concern that the move could reinforce unfounded fears and reduce vaccinations, HHS states that vaccine manufacturers can meet demand with thimerosal-free options.</p>

          <p>A recent government report in India has highlighted an alarming rise in student suicides, which now account for 7.6% of the country's total suicide deaths. Experts and mental health advocates attribute the crisis to a combination of extreme academic pressure, a "toxic competitiveness" within the education system, and inadequate institutional mental health support. Following the report, calls are growing for systemic reforms, including integrating mental health education into school curricula and providing better support systems for vulnerable students.</p>
