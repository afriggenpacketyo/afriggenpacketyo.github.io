          <p>Liverpool has finalized the acquisition of striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record fee of £125 million, potentially rising to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old Swedish international signed a six-year contract, expressing his motivation to win trophies and make history with the Premier League champions. This transfer is part of Liverpool's unprecedented summer spending spree, which has exceeded £450 million, setting a new Premier League record for a single transfer window. The deal surpasses the previous British record and ranks as one of the most expensive transfers in global football history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite repeated threats, President Trump has refrained from imposing severe new sanctions on Russia over its continued aggression in Ukraine. Analysts suggest two primary factors are influencing his hesitation: a desire to be seen as a peacemaker and concerns about pushing Russia into a closer alliance with China. Experts warn that isolating Russia could grant Beijing unprecedented access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic resources, thereby strengthening China's global position. This strategic pause has reportedly left Ukrainian officials disappointed, as they had hoped for stronger U.S. pressure to compel Putin toward a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Two-time champion Naomi Osaka delivered a commanding performance at the US Open, defeating American third seed Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 to reach her first major quarter-final since 2021. This victory marks Osaka's most significant win since returning to the sport after giving birth, showcasing a measured and powerful baseline game that capitalized on Gauff's unforced errors. Gauff, the 2023 champion, appeared uncertain and struggled with her forehand throughout the brief one-hour match. Osaka will now face Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova in the next round.</p>

The 24-year-old, a former No. 6 overall draft pick, reported stomach pain at the team facility and was advised to undergo immediate surgery. Coach Dave Canales has described Ekwonu's status as "day-to-day," noting that he did not participate in Monday's practice. If Ekwonu is unable to play, veteran backup Yosh Nijman is expected to take his place in the starting lineup.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The announcement came shortly after Giuliani was hospitalized with serious injuries from a car crash. Giuliani, once celebrated as "America's Mayor" for his leadership after 9/11, later became a controversial figure as a close advisor to Trump, known for promoting unsubstantiated claims about the 2020 election. This has led to his disbarment in New York and D.C. and significant legal and financial troubles.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi for £35 million has failed at the last minute on transfer deadline day. Although a deal was agreed upon and the 25-year-old had begun his medical, Crystal Palace ultimately refused to sanction the transfer. The club's inability to secure a suitable replacement, after their target Igor Julio opted for West Ham, led to the collapse of the move. Guehi, who is in the final year of his contract, will now return to Palace, leaving Liverpool's defensive reinforcement plans unfulfilled for now.</p>

          <p>A group of nine former leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are "endangering every American's health." In a New York Times essay, they criticized Kennedy for downplaying vaccines, promoting unproven treatments, and replacing scientific experts with unqualified individuals. Their warning follows the recent controversial firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, which prompted protests and resignations within the agency. The former officials argue Kennedy's leadership is undermining the nation's ability to respond to health emergencies.</p>

The U.S. government states the deployment is to combat drug trafficking, though it has also accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel.

Washington has warned that these oil purchases help fund Russia's war in Ukraine, but India maintains they are vital for its energy security.

          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has fallen by 1.2 million during the first seven months of the year under President Trump's administration. This decline, which includes both legal and undocumented workers, is attributed to stricter immigration policies, increased deportations, and a slowdown in border crossings. Economists express concern that this trend could create labor shortages, particularly in sectors like agriculture, construction, and services that heavily rely on immigrant labor.

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 800 people and devastating remote mountain villages in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. Survivors describe scenes of shock and destruction, with entire villages reduced to rubble and families wiped out. Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads and the region's difficult terrain, forcing reliance on helicopters. Eyewitnesses report a desperate need for aid, with many residents now homeless and sleeping in the open while still feeling frequent aftershocks.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the U.S. are facing a severe financial crisis. Many have launched emergency fundraising drives and have seen a strong initial response from the public, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain. Stations in rural and less affluent areas are particularly vulnerable, with some already forced to cut staff and programming. While national networks are reducing dues and philanthropic efforts are underway, station managers fear that some local broadcasters may not survive the cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has publicly criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-war security guarantees. Pistorius called the discussion "completely wrong" and premature, stating that such topics should not be debated publicly before peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have begun. He also noted that the EU lacks the jurisdiction to deploy troops. His remarks highlight potential divisions among European leaders regarding the long-term strategy for ensuring Ukraine's security.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has named his six wildcard picks, confirming a team that includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Despite the continuity, Donald warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" performance, stressing that winning on American soil at Bethpage presents a completely different challenge. He emphasized that he will not necessarily use the same pairings and will adapt his strategy for the away match. Donald also urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta by releasing a satirical short story. The move comes after her iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was removed from some school libraries under a new provincial rule targeting materials with "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story criticizes the policy and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who supports it. This is part of a growing trend of book challenges, originating in the U.S., that is now affecting Canadian schools and libraries.</p>
