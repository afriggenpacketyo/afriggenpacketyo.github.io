          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of non-Eswatini nationals, convicted of serious crimes including murder and child sexual assault, to the African nation of Eswatini. This action is part of a broader, controversial U.S. strategy to send deportees to third-party countries when their home nations refuse to accept them. Critics raise humanitarian and legal concerns about the safety of these third countries and the due process for deportees, a practice recently bolstered by a Supreme Court decision expediting such removals. The government of Eswatini stated it will work to return the men to their countries of origin.</p>

          <p>Florida health officials have confirmed that four people have died this year from Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters. A total of 11 infections have been reported in the state in 2025. The bacteria can enter the body through open wounds or by consuming raw shellfish, causing severe illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. While infections are rare, they can lead to necrotizing fasciitis and have a high fatality rate, prompting officials to issue warnings about water exposure and food safety.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will use Google's cloud infrastructure to support its popular ChatGPT service, adding Google to its list of key suppliers alongside Microsoft, Oracle, and CoreWeave. This move reflects OpenAI's need for increased computing power to meet high user demand and signifies a strategic expansion beyond its initial exclusive reliance on Microsoft's cloud services. The partnership is a notable win for Google's cloud division, which also provides infrastructure for AI competitor Anthropic. This diversification addresses capacity constraints previously highlighted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is receiving accolades for his strategic navigation of U.S.-China trade tensions, culminating in Washington's approval to resume sales of specialized AI chips to China. The U.S. government is expected to grant licenses for the sale of the H20 chip, a less powerful version designed to comply with export controls, reversing a recent ban. Analysts credit Huang's statesmanship and persistent argument that U.S. tech leadership is best served by engaging with China's vast market. This development has been viewed as a significant diplomatic and business victory for the world's most valuable company.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, tasked with settling legal disputes between states. Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, its rulings are legally binding for the 193 UN member states, though enforcement is a major challenge. The court's jurisdiction applies when states agree to it, either through a blanket declaration, mutual consent for a specific dispute, or by being signatories to treaties like the Genocide Convention, which designates the ICJ as the arbiter. However, the ICJ lacks an enforcement body, relying on the cooperation of the involved parties.</p>

The bill aims to close loopholes that lawmakers argue could be used for corruption by capping contributions, banning foreign and lobbyist donations, and requiring quarterly disclosures. It would also prohibit the conversion of donations for personal use.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged four Louisiana law enforcement officials, including two active police chiefs, and a local businessman in a widespread visa fraud scheme. The indictment alleges they conspired to create fabricated police reports of armed robberies to help immigrants fraudulently obtain U visas, which are reserved for victims of certain crimes. The officials allegedly received thousands of dollars for each falsified report they produced. The charges include conspiracy, visa fraud, mail fraud, and bribery, carrying potential sentences of decades in prison and significant financial penalties for the accused.</p>

          <p>A long-standing debate among Germany's 16 federal states over the scheduling of summer school vacations has intensified. Most states rotate their vacation start times to manage travel and tourism demand, but the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg always take their break last. Other states argue this system is unfair, as it forces their residents into peak-priced travel periods while the southern states benefit from late-summer bargains. The southern states have refused to change their traditional rhythm, which they say is part of their identity and necessary for their academic calendars.</p>

The song's raw depiction of the immigrant experience caught the attention of musicians like Tom Morello, who called them his "new favorite band" and invited them to perform at a benefit concert. The group, fronted by rappers Amon the MC and Verde, combines hip-hop with funk and metal influences to create powerful social commentary.

A primary driver for this early start is consumer concern over potential price hikes due to new tariffs and persistent inflation, with many shoppers hunting for deals to maximize their budgets. Overall spending is projected to rise slightly to $128.2 billion, but this is due to more people shopping, as average spending per family is expected to decrease.
