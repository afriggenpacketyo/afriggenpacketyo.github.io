          <p>The NFL season began with a notable incident as Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected before the first play. The ejection occurred after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was called against him for allegedly spitting at Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. Video replay captured the exchange between the two players, which led to immediate action from the referees. This unusual event set a contentious tone for the start of the highly anticipated game.</p>

          <p>In a strategic move within the New York City mayoral race, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate. This comes after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for debates with Mamdani, amid reports that the White House is trying to consolidate the race into a two-person contest. Both incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa have stated they will not drop out of the race. The situation highlights the complex political maneuvering occurring ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order authorizing the Department of Defense to adopt the 'Department of War' as a secondary title. This move, which circumvents the need for immediate congressional approval, allows officials to use the new name in communications and the defense secretary to be called the 'secretary of war.' The administration argues the change, reverting to the pre-1949 name, projects strength and a readiness to wage war. The order also directs the department to recommend legislative actions for a permanent name change.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened higher after President Trump signed an executive order to lower the import tariff on Japanese automobiles from 27.5% to 15%.

Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant jump, with other regional indices also posting gains. This development reflects positive sentiment regarding international trade relations and economic stability.

          <p>Tattoos have entered the mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, reflecting a cultural shift towards individuality and self-expression. While many artists and enthusiasts view tattooing as a legitimate art form, studies show that some social stigma persists, potentially affecting job prospects and perceptions of trustworthiness. The practice is particularly popular among millennials, with over 40% having a tattoo. Art institutions are also beginning to recognize its artistic merit, as seen in a recent exhibit.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released her first memoir, 'Mother Mary Comes to Me,' a raw and unflinching account of her relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book explores the complex bond with her mother, a renowned educator and feminist icon in India whom she describes as both 'my shelter and my storm.' Roy reflects on how her turbulent childhood shaped her as a writer, providing a 'reportage of the heart' rather than a traditional hagiography, delving into their intense but life-affirming connection.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced a contentious, multi-hour hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, where he was questioned by members of both parties. Key moments included his defense of the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, whom he accused of lying. Several Republican senators, including physician Bill Cassidy, joined Democrats in challenging Kennedy's recent policy changes that have limited access to COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy appeared combative throughout, defending the major shake-ups at the public health agency.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a calculated financial move 'based on mathematics.' Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones argued that the high cost of one player could instead be allocated to pay for several top-tier players, improving the team's overall depth and reducing the risk associated with having a large portion of the salary cap tied to a single individual.</p>

          <p>The debate over vaccinations in the United States has evolved into a broader proxy war concerning trust in government, individual freedom, and public health policy. This conflict is centered on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policy shifts, which have rolled back federal vaccine recommendations. In response, states are diverging along ideological lines, with Florida moving to end mandates while West Coast states form an alliance to protect them. This fragmentation highlights a deep national division, transforming public health into a central political battleground.</p>

Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations.</p>

This request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that provide tenure protections to officials at independent regulatory agencies. The Justice Department is arguing that the modern FTC wields substantial executive power and its commissioners should serve at the president's will.</p>
