          <p>U.S. negotiators stated that any extension of the current 90-day tariff pause with China requires President Trump's final approval. Following talks in Stockholm, officials are returning to Washington to brief the president, who indicated a decision would be made promptly. Chinese negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed both sides aim to prolong the pause, which is set to expire on August 12. If no agreement is reached, tariffs are expected to revert to their higher April levels, a scenario U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent termed "boomeranging." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams revealed that the gunman in the deadly Midtown Manhattan office shooting intended to attack the NFL's headquarters. The shooter, Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the league for his condition. Tamura, who never played in the NFL, mistakenly took an elevator to a different company's office, where he killed four people before taking his own life. The victims included an NYPD officer and a Blackstone executive.</p>

          <p>The largest U.S. rail workers' union, SMART-TD, plans to formally oppose the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cited significant concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and a "troubling safety record," which they argue prioritizes profits over worker and public safety. In contrast, the union noted that Norfolk Southern has adopted more progressive labor policies. The union will present its case to the Surface Transportation Board, the federal body that must approve the deal.</p>

A lower court previously ruled against the administration, but that decision was stayed on appeal.

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is expected to be a major windfall for large technology companies by restoring several key tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation permanently brings back immediate expensing for R&D, 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, and more flexible interest deduction rules. According to analysts, these changes will significantly boost free cash flow for tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, providing more capital for AI investments and shareholder returns.

The states fear the information, including immigration status and addresses, will be used to facilitate mass deportations. The USDA has ordered states to turn over the data, claiming it is needed to combat fraud, and has threatened to withhold funding for non-compliance.

          <p>A CBS News analysis of polling data reveals that President Trump's job approval rating among young Americans (ages 18-29) has fallen significantly since his inauguration, from 55% to 28%. The decline has been steepest among less partisan and politically unengaged young people, particularly young men. A growing majority of young voters now say the president's policies are making them financially worse off and that his administration is focusing too much on issues like tariffs and deportations instead of lowering prices. This trend could pose a challenge for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
