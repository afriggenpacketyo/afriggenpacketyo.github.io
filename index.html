          <p>The European Union and China have agreed to a new "export supply mechanism" aimed at ensuring a stable supply of critical raw materials. The agreement, announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a summit in Beijing, is designed to quickly address and resolve any supply chain bottlenecks. Von der Leyen emphasized the need for reliable mineral supplies from China and noted that the mechanism is crucial for rebuilding trust in their trade relationship. This development was part of a broader summit where both parties also committed to collaboration on global issues like climate change.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current savings account interest rates, highlighting the significant difference between standard and high-yield savings accounts. As of July 2025, the national average rate is a mere 0.38%, while top high-yield accounts offer over 4%, demonstrating a substantial opportunity for savers to grow their funds more effectively. Financial experts advise comparing various accounts, particularly those from online banks which often provide higher rates and lower fees due to reduced overhead costs. Securing a higher rate can dramatically increase earnings over time through the power of compounding interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a significant commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during economic uncertainty. This article examines the factors influencing its price, which as of July 23, 2025, stands at $3,430.21 per ounce. Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, geopolitical instability, and central bank policies. The value of the U.S. dollar also plays a crucial role, as a weaker dollar typically makes gold cheaper for foreign investors, thereby increasing demand and driving up the price of the precious metal.

          <p>American Airlines has lowered its 2025 profit outlook and provided a third-quarter forecast that falls below Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to decline. The airline cited domestic consumer weakness, stagnant corporate travel demand, and operational disruptions from storms as primary reasons for the revision. The new forecast projects an adjusted per-share result for 2025 ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a significant reduction from its earlier, more optimistic estimates. Despite a slight revenue increase in the second quarter, the carrier is scaling back capacity growth to adapt to the challenging market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least eleven people have been killed in a significant escalation of conflict along the Thailand-Cambodia border, involving artillery, rockets, and Thai airstrikes. The fighting, which prompted Thailand to seal border crossings and evacuate communities, reportedly began after a landmine incident wounded Thai soldiers. Both nations have accused the other of initiating the hostilities, with Cambodia calling for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address what it terms "Thailand's aggression." The clashes represent a severe deterioration in relations following previous border disputes, raising concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>Police documents released after Bryan Kohberger's sentencing have revealed chilling new details about unusual events at the victims' home before the November 2022 murders. One of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves, had reported seeing an unknown man staring at her, and on another occasion, the residents found their front door open and loose on its hinges. It is not clear if these incidents are connected to Kohberger, who was sentenced to life in prison for the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. The documents also detail the extensive investigation, including numerous tips and the use of DNA evidence to identify Kohberger.</p>

          <p>Tesla's shares dropped significantly in premarket trading after the company reported another quarter of declining automotive revenue, which fell 16% year-over-year. CEO Elon Musk warned that Tesla could face a "few rough quarters" ahead, partly due to the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits and increasing competition in key markets. The disappointing results and murky outlook have contributed to a nearly 18% decline in Tesla's stock value year-to-date. Investors are now looking to the launch of a more affordable model to potentially reinvigorate sales and refresh the company's aging product lineup. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how the American summer camp experience has transformed over the decades, shifting from a focus on general outdoor activities to more specialized and shorter sessions. Originating in the 19th century to build character in boys, camps have evolved to cater to specific interests like coding or sports, and to accommodate complex family schedules with one or two-week blocks. While this offers flexibility, some experts and parents worry it may hinder the development of deep friendships and turn camp into another high-pressure, resume-building environment. The piece reflects on whether this shift has made camp less fun for today's children.</p>

          <p>A senior NHS England director, Prof Tim Briggs, has warned that the upcoming five-day strike by resident doctors will inevitably cause patient harm. While acknowledging the right to strike, he stated that the walkouts will disrupt both emergency and non-urgent care, such as hip and knee operations, which can have serious adverse effects on patients who have already faced long waits. The British Medical Association (BMA) maintains that the strike is necessary due to the ongoing pay dispute and has recommended that non-urgent care be cancelled to ensure emergency services are safely covered. The strike follows a breakdown in talks with the government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. fertility rate dropped to an all-time low in 2024, with the figure now standing at fewer than 1.6 children per woman, according to new federal data. This rate is well below the 2.1 children per woman needed for a generation to replace itself and is on par with rates in many Western European countries. The decline is part of a nearly two-decade trend attributed to women delaying childbirth or choosing not to have children. While the Trump administration has explored pro-natalist policies, population experts suggest the trend is part of an ongoing process and not yet a cause for alarm.</p>

This figure marks an acceleration from the previous quarter's 2% growth, countering the narrative that tools like ChatGPT are eroding Google's core business. The positive volume growth suggests that Google's strategy of integrating AI features into its own search products and the persistence of user habits are effectively defending its market position. The strong performance may lead to a positive reevaluation of Alphabet's stock, which has been trading at a discount compared to its tech peers. (not investment advice)</p>
