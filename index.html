          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing concerns about a potential financial crisis due to intense price wars among manufacturers. BYD, the market leader, has initiated significant price cuts, leading to reduced profits for both brands and sellers. The People's Daily, a Communist Party paper, criticized the "disorderly 'price wars'" for squeezing profits and impacting the entire ecosystem, warning of unsustainable competition. An executive from Great Wall Motor likened the situation to an "Evergrande-like" crisis, while BYD defended its actions as fair competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to fire all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has generated controversy and concern among health experts. Kennedy stated his intention to "re-establish public confidence" in vaccines, but critics argue that his actions undermine science and could increase public distrust. Experts warn that this move could lead to politicized recommendations, potentially impacting vaccination rates and public health. The potential impact on vaccine manufacturers is uncertain, but the move introduces more uncertainty to the regulatory process around shots.</p>
