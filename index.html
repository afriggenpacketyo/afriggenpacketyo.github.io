          <p>The Education Department announced it will restart collecting payments on defaulted student loans, including wage garnishment, starting May 5. Over 5 million borrowers are in default, with millions more at risk, potentially affecting nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio. Borrowers will receive emails about repayment options, while wage garnishment notices will follow later this summer. The department emphasizes there will be no mass loan forgiveness, shifting focus to responsible program management and assisting borrowers in returning to repayment, citing the Biden administration's past misleading statements regarding debt waiver authority.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two foreign students detained by ICE for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. The lawmakers criticized the Trump administration's crackdown on alleged antisemitism on college campuses and accused them of sending the students to Louisiana to limit their constitutional rights. They also raised concerns about medical care at the detention facilities and accused the administration of lying about bed space availability to justify moving Öztürk to a conservative court jurisdiction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA announced plans to phase out several synthetic food dyes, including Yellow 5 and Red 40, due to concerns about potential adverse neurobehavioral effects, particularly in children. This decision follows growing pressure from health advocates and state-level bans on artificial food dyes. While the FDA is not implementing an outright ban, they have reached an "understanding" with food companies to voluntarily phase out the dyes by the end of next year, encouraging the use of natural alternatives. This move aims to address health concerns and streamline food regulations across states.</p>

The president's remarks follow concerns about the impact of tariffs on the stock market and interest rates, as well as warnings from China against trade deals that negatively impact its interests.</p>
