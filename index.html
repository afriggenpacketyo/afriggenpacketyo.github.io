          <p>Benjamin Elliott was convicted of first-degree murder for the 2021 stabbing death of his twin sister, Meghan, despite his defense team arguing he was sleepwalking. Benjamin claimed the incident felt like a dream and immediately called 911, expressing remorse. Prosecutors, however, highlighted inconsistencies in his account, including two stab wounds and his calm demeanor during interrogation, suggesting a deliberate act. The jury ultimately found him guilty, leading to a 15-year prison sentence, which Benjamin is appealing, maintaining his innocence and belief in a miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, including freezing assets and halting arms deals, utilizing a 'snapback' mechanism from the 2015 nuclear deal. This action comes as Iran's economy faces severe challenges, with its currency at a record low and food prices skyrocketing, exacerbating daily life for its citizens. European nations, who triggered the snapback, cited Iran's non-cooperation with IAEA inspectors and its continued uranium enrichment as reasons. The move intensifies pressure on Tehran, which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has condemned the sanctions as unjust.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off its entire stake in the company, a process that began in 2022. BYD executives expressed gratitude for Buffett's long-term support, stating that buying and selling stocks is a normal part of investing. Despite the company's unfazed public stance, BYD shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong following the news. The divestment coincides with BYD cutting its 2025 sales target and reporting its first quarterly profit decline in over three years, signaling a cooling growth period.</p>

          <p>Amber Smith, wife of former country star Granger Smith, has shared harrowing details of her husband's near-suicide attempt following their 3-year-old son River's drowning in 2019. In her forthcoming memoir, she recounts Granger, in a drunken state after a show, putting a gun in his mouth, overwhelmed by grief and spiritual warfare. Granger, now a minister, credits his faith with saving him in that moment, when he cried out to Jesus. The couple, who later welcomed another son, have become advocates for children's water safety.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the return of Donald Trump to power could signal a 'reverse convergence' in US-China relations, moving away from ideological competition. Historically, the West has pushed a convergence theory, expecting societies to become more alike as they industrialize. However, the author argues that the US now appears to be adopting approaches similar to China's regarding political legitimacy and matters of war and peace. This shift implies a potential end to the ideological framework that has long defined the relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have urged Iran to de-escalate tensions and engage in negotiations after the reinstatement of UN sanctions over its nuclear program. The three European countries, known as the E3, stated they had 'no choice' but to trigger the snapback mechanism due to Iran's continued nuclear escalation and lack of cooperation. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the sanctions as 'unfair, unjust, and illegal,' while insisting the country has no intention of developing nuclear weapons. Tehran has recalled its ambassadors to the three European nations for consultations, signaling diplomatic strain.</p>

A hazardous situation arose in Globe when approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks were scattered throughout the community by the floodwaters, though none ignited.

This trial, a collaboration with the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food sources and address climate change by re-wetting peat soils to lock in greenhouse gases.

Their humorous yet inventive scientific endeavor confirmed that shoe odor, caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, is a significant problem, leading many to keep footwear outdoors. The team's experiments demonstrated that a brief exposure to UVC light effectively kills the bacteria and eliminates the smell. This led to a prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack, offering a novel solution to a universal household issue.</p>

President Nicolás Maduro has ordered the military to train civilians for a potential 'undeclared war,' following US counter-narcotics operations that destroyed boats and killed at least 17 people. The US, which does not recognize Maduro's re-election, has also designated a Venezuelan gang as a terrorist group and increased the reward for Maduro's capture.

By expanding cabin space and lowering the price, the Model Y L broadens its appeal, accelerating EV adoption and reducing heat-trapping transportation pollution.

          <p>Europe secured a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only two and a half more points for retention. The European team delivered an 'ugly' day for the Americans, both on and off the course, with widespread reports of thuggish and personal insults from US galleries directed at European players. Despite the hostile environment and a minor on-course scuffle involving Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau, Europe maintained its focus, with players like Tommy Fleetwood contributing significantly to their historic pre-singles lead.</p>

Trump's approach, which often treats professional disapproval as validation, allows him to frame inconsistencies as strategic genius. The article notes his recent actions, from expressing hopes for peace while criticizing late-night television, to framing the James Comey indictment as vindication. This pattern reinforces an image of a leader operating above conventional political, legal, or diplomatic consequences, suggesting a 'politics of the untouchable.'</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new memoir, 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing justice on contentious cases. Kennedy, who viewed his Western origins as central to his perspective, notes that 'the cases swung, not me,' as the court became increasingly conservative. He expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival.

          <p>A shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility resulted in the death of 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes and critically injured two other detainees, Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing indiscriminately at the building and its sallyport from an elevated position. FBI investigations suggest the attack was targeted, with anti-ICE messages found on shell casings. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, attributing it to anti-ICE rhetoric, and ordered increased security at facilities nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate, with some dermatologists expressing skepticism despite anecdotal evidence. While collagen is vital for skin integrity, its journey through the digestive system and targeted delivery to skin cells is complex. Marine collagen, in peptide form, is considered most effective among types due to its higher Type 1 collagen content. However, industry-funded studies often show significant improvements in skin hydration and elasticity, while independent research frequently finds no substantial effect. Experts emphasize sun protection, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful for skin health than supplements.</p>

Leeds had held a 12-6 lead at halftime and wasted several opportunities to extend it, ultimately succumbing to a mesmerizing 16-pass move that culminated in Wright's match-winning touchdown.

A recent YouTube video by a disillusioned tourist highlighted the stark contrast between social media portrayals and the island's growing strain. Overtourism, with visitor numbers expected to exceed seven million this year, has led to unchecked urban development and poor waste management, contributing to recent deadly floods. While local efforts are underway to promote sustainable development and clean-ups, the island's unique cultural and natural assets are being eroded, prompting calls for responsible tourism.</p>

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and other Democratic lawmakers immediately pushed back, calling any deployment an 'abuse of power' and urging residents not to be incited. Concerns were raised about the legality of the Antifa designation and previous federal interventions, as well as ICE's targeting of individuals not deemed dangerous.</p>

This public display follows Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, despite the central bank's recent rate cut. While no US president has ever successfully fired a Fed chair, a recent Supreme Court decision indicated the president lacks authority to remove Fed officials at will. The move, including a prior attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, raises concerns among economists and investors about the Fed's independence and potential market instability.</p>
