        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, citing the US Constitution's exclusive powers to Congress to regulate commerce. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but if unsuccessful, businesses who paid tariffs may receive refunds with interest. The ruling is seen as a potential shift from strongman tariffs to institutional guardrails, offering a fresh dose of macro stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Wu Xinbo of Fudan University believes that while Trump might continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint due to the side effects on the US. These alternative measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security, as Trump seeks new ways to exert pressure.</p>

          <h2>Why Do So Many Americans Join the Israeli Military?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the reasons behind the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It delves into the radicalization process and the elaborate social apparatus that influences young Americans to serve in a foreign army. The author contrasts this with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians and questions the lack of attention given to the radicalization of young Zionist men and women, particularly concerning their involvement in alleged war crimes.</p>

          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell highlights the dire situation for children in Gaza, where they are starving due to restricted aid access. She recounts the story of a young girl injured in an airstrike and stresses the need for safe and sustained access for humanitarian organizations. Russell criticizes the new aid delivery system backed by Israel, arguing it is incompatible with humanitarian principles and threatens to worsen the situation. She urges all parties to respect international humanitarian law and allow the UN to resume its aid operations.</p>

          <p>The Angels' offense remained quiet in a 1-0 shutout loss to the Yankees, continuing a disappointing homestand. Despite hope from a previous ninth-inning rally, the team struggled to produce runs, walking the least and striking out the second-most in MLB. Manager Ron Washington's strategies, including intentionally walking Aaron Judge, couldn't salvage the game. The Angels made roster moves, including activating Robert Stephenson and recalling Scott Kingery, while Mike Trout nears his return from injury.</p>
