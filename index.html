The event underscores the need for greater transparency and scrutiny in vetting individuals who gain access to high-level political events.

          <p>A federal judge has approved a multi-billion dollar settlement in the House v. NCAA case, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly paid. The settlement allows NCAA's top division schools to compensate athletes, limited initially by a $20.5 million salary cap per school. Additionally, over $2 billion will be paid to former college athletes who were previously prohibited from earning money. The settlement marks a significant shift away from the tradition of amateurism in college athletics, and the new system is expected to impact how schools recruit and compensate players.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly suggested creating a new political party, potentially escalating his feud with President Trump. Musk polled his followers on X about creating a party representing the '80% in the middle,' and endorsed the name 'America Party.' This move comes after public disagreements with Trump over policy issues and accusations of ingratitude. Musk's exploration of a new political party could signal a challenge to Trump's influence and a continued engagement in politics.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas casino dealers are facing layoffs amid a recent slowdown in tourism, with several major resorts and hotels quietly cutting jobs. The tourism dip is attributed to rising travel costs, fewer international visitors, and economic uncertainty. Some properties are moving toward more automated systems, leading to a decline in dealer enrollment and opportunities. The situation reflects the challenges faced by the Las Vegas economy amid changing market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>
