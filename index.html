        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithium Americas' stock surged 95% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This move is part of renegotiating a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. The White House aims to secure a small equity stake as a cash buffer for taxpayers, reflecting a broader strategy to gain direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. The Thacker Pass mine is projected to be a significant source of North American lithium, essential for electric vehicle batteries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As fall approaches, differing recommendations for children's COVID-19 and flu vaccines are causing confusion among parents. While flu shots are consistently advised for children aged 6 months and older by the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), COVID-19 vaccine advice varies. The CDC suggests parents discuss benefits with a provider, but the AAP "strongly recommends" COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years old, differing from the CDC's latest advisory committee vote. These shifts stem partly from new CDC advisory committee members appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for vaccine skepticism.</p>

          <p>With U.S. debt levels rising, many Americans are struggling to pay off high-interest balances, particularly credit card debt. This article outlines critical mistakes to avoid that can hinder debt repayment progress. Key pitfalls include only making minimum payments, taking on new debt, ignoring professional help, draining emergency funds, and failing to adjust spending habits. The most damaging error is delaying action, as interest compounds quickly. Successfully managing debt requires planning, persistence, and avoiding these common missteps to ensure a smoother and more effective repayment journey. (not investment advice)</p>

This development follows the resignation of the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, who had opposed filing charges against Comey. President Trump has frequently targeted Comey, calling him "guilty as hell" in recent social media posts.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media Group is still evaluating whether to air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations, having preempted the show's return. This decision follows Kimmel's controversial comments linking a conservative activist's alleged killer to the MAGA movement, leading to a temporary suspension by ABC parent Disney. FCC Chair Brendan Carr had suggested ABC affiliates could risk broadcast licenses over Kimmel's remarks, raising free speech concerns. Nexstar stated discussions with Disney focus on ensuring the program respects the diverse interests of the communities they serve.</p>

          <p>Two e-commerce entrepreneurs, Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, who acquired distressed retail brands like RadioShack and Pier 1 Imports, face accusations of running a $112 million Ponzi scheme. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges they made material misrepresentations to hundreds of investors between 2020 and 2022, claiming their portfolio companies were "on fire" and had "strong cash flow." In reality, none generated profits, and funds from new investors or other companies were allegedly used to pay existing obligations. The SEC claims at least $5.9 million in investor returns were Ponzi-like payments, with $16 million allocated for the founders' personal use.</p>

          <p>Medical professionals and public health officials are strongly disagreeing with President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking acetaminophen for pain or fever. Doctors emphasize that high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous for both mother and baby, potentially leading to cardiac issues or central nervous system abnormalities in the fetus. They reiterate that acetaminophen, found in Tylenol, remains the safest over-the-counter option during pregnancy, citing overwhelming evidence that it does not cause autism. Concerns are raised that Trump's advice could lead women to avoid necessary treatment or turn to less safe medications.</p>

He notes that electricity is the biggest bottleneck for AI, leading to his investments in nuclear energy. While critics point to a circular financing model and inflated market values for partners, Altman remains confident in AI's long-term societal value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China Pledges First Absolute Target to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2035</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has announced its first absolute target to cut emissions, aiming for a 7-10% reduction by 2035 from peak levels. President Xi Jinping made the pledge at the UN in New York, contrasting with the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under President Trump. Environmentalists express disappointment, stating the target falls short of what's needed to meet global 1.5C warming goals, with many scenarios requiring over 50% reduction. Despite this, China has a track record of exceeding renewable energy commitments, and its rapid clean tech growth suggests it may surpass this target.</p>

          <p>An aggressive squirrel in San Rafael, California, has reportedly attacked multiple residents, sending at least two to the emergency room with claw and bite injuries. Witnesses describe the squirrel launching itself at people "out of nowhere." Flyers have been posted warning the community about the "very mean squirrel." Wildlife experts suggest the aggressive behavior likely stems from the squirrel being fed by humans when it was young, leading it to associate people with food. Officials advise against feeding wild animals, though experts confirm squirrels are not typically rabies vectors.</p>
