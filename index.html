          <p>AI developer Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who alleged the company used pirated copies of their books. The writers claimed an estimated 500,000 books were used to train the Claude AI model without permission or compensation. This agreement, which amounts to about $3,000 per book, is being hailed as the largest copyright recovery ever and a significant turning point in the legal battles between AI companies and content creators. The settlement resolves legacy claims and sets a major precedent for how AI models can be trained using copyrighted materials.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her pointed written exchanges with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Barrett explained that a recent "spirited argument" from Jackson in a dissenting opinion merited an equally "spirited response" in the majority opinion. She emphasized that their professional disagreements are confined to legal arguments and do not affect their personal relationship, stating she has "great respect" for her colleague. Barrett invoked the late Justice Antonin Scalia's philosophy of attacking ideas, not people, to characterize the court's internal dynamic as collegial despite ideological divides.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is scheduled to make an "important campaign announcement" as reports circulate that advisors to President Trump are considering nominating him as the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent after facing low approval ratings and a now-dropped federal indictment, has been struggling in the polls. His potential exit from the race could consolidate the field and alter the dynamics for other candidates. The announcement follows the dismissal of federal corruption charges against Adams in April at the request of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Now the head coach for the University of North Carolina's football team, Bill Belichick has reportedly banned scouts from the New England Patriots from accessing the UNC program. This move is seen as a lingering sign of friction following his departure from the Patriots after 24 seasons and six Super Bowl wins. Belichick's tenure in New England ended after the 2023 season amid a period of decline for the team. Despite the apparent tension, Patriots owner Robert Kraft recently stated he still plans to honor Belichick with a statue next to Tom Brady's.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a pause on the country's 2026 electric vehicle sales target, which required 20% of new car sales to be electric. The move is part of a broader economic strategy that includes a new "Buy Canadian" policy to prioritize domestic goods for federal contracts, aimed at supporting the economy amid U.S. trade tariffs. While the 2026 goal is suspended, longer-term targets for 2030 and 2035 remain in place.

Additionally, Broadcom's stock soared after announcing a new $10 billion AI chip contract, reportedly with OpenAI.

While Kugler's representatives attribute this to a county clerical error, the situation has drawn scrutiny amid a politically charged environment at the Fed.

This is one of the largest antitrust penalties the EU has ever imposed on a tech company.

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of slowing in August, with employers adding a mere 22,000 jobs, far below expectations. The unemployment rate also ticked up to 4.3%, its highest level since 2021. Adding to the concern, revised data for June revealed a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since the pandemic began in 2020. The slowdown was broad, with manufacturing and federal employment seeing notable declines, while healthcare was one of the few sectors to add jobs. These figures suggest that economic uncertainty, potentially linked to trade tariffs, is impacting business hiring decisions.</p>

          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" indicates a significant strategic pivot away from its core business of selling electric cars and toward artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and autonomous robotaxis. The document makes no mention of new consumer EV models, instead focusing on a future where Tesla robots perform mundane tasks to create "sustainable abundance." This shift comes as Tesla's auto sales have slumped amid growing competition and controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. The plan aligns with a new proposed pay package that could award Musk up to $1 trillion if he meets ambitious targets for deploying robots and robotaxis.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially scrapped a proposed rule that would have required airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant delays and cancellations within the carriers' control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, was never implemented and faced strong opposition from the airline industry, which argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department would reconsider such "extra-statutory requirements" while still enforcing congressionally mandated consumer protections, such as refunds for canceled flights. Airline trade groups praised the decision, aligning it with a deregulatory agenda.</p>

          <p>Endico Potatoes Inc. has issued a recall for its 2.5 lb bags of frozen peas and carrots and mixed vegetables due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The recalled products were distributed between July and August 2025 in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, and Washington, D.C. The contamination was discovered during product sampling at a distributor, though no illnesses have been reported to date. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections, particularly in young children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

          <p>U.S. military veterans are expressing outrage over the arrest of former Army sergeant Bajun Mavalwalla II on federal conspiracy charges related to a protest against ICE policies. Mavalwalla, who is part of a community that helps evacuate and resettle Afghan allies, was arrested by the FBI more than a month after the demonstration. His supporters argue that his arrest is an attempt to criminalize peaceful dissent and is particularly shameful given his service and advocacy work. Legal experts note that a conspiracy charge focuses on intent and agreement to impede an officer, a standard that critics worry could be used to suppress civil liberties.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online browsing is not a sackable offense. The case involved an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage, finding she had spent time on sites like Amazon and Rightmove. The judge awarded her over £14,000 for unfair dismissal, noting that the time was not excessive and the company had no clear policy against such activity. The ruling suggests the dismissal was actually motivated by the business owner's desire to hire a relative.</p>

          <p>President Trump is escalating threats to deploy the National Guard into major U.S. cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, citing public safety concerns despite data showing declining crime rates. The threats persist even after a federal judge ruled that a similar deployment in Los Angeles was unlawful. Democratic officials in Illinois and Maryland have voiced strong opposition, preparing for legal challenges, while Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed the potential intervention. The situation is creating a tense standoff over federal authority and the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, with DHS already requesting Pentagon assistance for ICE operations near Chicago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals expecting an inheritance while married, especially in a community-property state like Arizona, it is crucial to keep the funds separate to protect them in case of a future divorce. Inheritances and gifts are typically considered separate property, but they can become marital assets if they are commingled with joint finances. To ensure the money remains solely yours, it should be deposited into a separate brokerage or bank account held only in your name. Investing these funds into shared retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA should be done with caution, as contributions and growth during the marriage are often considered community property.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a bill raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This modifies the $10,000 cap that was implemented as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Before 2018, the deduction was unlimited for over a century. The change is a victory for lawmakers from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who argue the previous cap constituted double taxation. However, budget analysts project the higher cap will increase the national debt by over $142 billion over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>
