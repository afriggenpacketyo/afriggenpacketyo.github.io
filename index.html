          <p>A multi-day manhunt is underway for a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider the suspect, Michael Paul Brown, to be armed and dangerous, prompting the closure of nearby national forest areas as the search spans rugged terrain. The small, tight-knit community is in shock, as the suspect was reportedly a regular at the bar and knew the victims, with his family stating he has a history of mental illness.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's recent signings and the hiring of Pep Lijnders as an assistant coach suggest a significant tactical shift for the club under Pep Guardiola. This article analyzes how new players like Rayan Cherki and Rayan Ait-Nouri, who excel at direct dribbling and attacking, point towards a move away from slow, possession-based play. This evolution embraces a more dynamic, transition-focused style, reflecting a broader trend in modern football towards high-octane, vertical attacks.</p>

These outbreaks complicate efforts to reintegrate the country and maintain stability following the ousting of Bashar Assad, as ethnic and religious minorities remain wary of the new leadership.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech start-ups Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for China's burgeoning biotech sector. The success is partly driven by new blockbuster drugs, such as Innovent's weight-loss treatment mazdutide, which is expected to generate substantial revenue. This shift to profitability indicates that many Chinese biotech firms have matured and are no longer solely reliant on investor funding for their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A riot at a prison in Tuxpan, in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. The unrest reportedly broke out due to inmates' anger over extortion and abuse by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization operating within the facility. The incident highlights the persistent problems of gang control, corruption, and overcrowding that plague many of Mexico's prisons.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese defense researchers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to dramatically increase their survivability. The concept involves fitting drones with small, side-mounted rocket boosters that would allow them to perform sudden, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers to dodge incoming missiles. Digital simulations suggest this technology could boost a drone's survival rate to nearly 90%, countering even sophisticated air defense systems.</p>
