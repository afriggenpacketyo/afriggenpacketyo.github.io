          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following intense backlash over the host's comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after the FCC chairman suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk and Nexstar Media Group, a major affiliate operator, preempted the show. Kimmel had suggested in his monologue that the accused killer was aligned with the MAGA movement, sparking outrage from conservatives and fueling a broader debate about media responsibility and free speech in a polarized political climate.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to designate the anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a social media post, he also recommended investigations into individuals who allegedly fund the group. The announcement did not specify when the designation would occur or what its legal implications might be, as antifa is generally considered a loosely affiliated network of activists rather than a formal, structured organization. This move revives a theme from his presidency, reflecting his administration's confrontational stance toward left-leaning protest movements.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell after the company reported mixed quarterly earnings and announced it was focusing on guest experience following a reversed rebrand attempt. The company faced intense customer backlash for a new, modernized logo that removed its iconic "Old Timer" image, which critics called "soulless." After a swift public outcry, the company abandoned the rebrand, stating it had listened to its passionate customer base. The CEO confirmed that the company is now pivoting its strategy to lean into the brand's nostalgic appeal.</p>

          <p>The president of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, has publicly called on the German government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. The plea was made during an event commemorating the council's 75th anniversary, attended by Chancellor Friedrich Merz. While acknowledging that criticism of the Israeli government must be possible, Merz stated that such criticism should not serve as a pretext for antisemitism. The exchange highlights Germany's complex position, balancing its historical responsibilities with contemporary geopolitical pressures related to the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <h2>National Academies Issues Strong Rebuke of EPA's Climate Change Dismissal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In its most forceful statement to date, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine declared that the evidence for human-caused climate change is "beyond scientific dispute." The report directly counters the Trump administration's efforts to revoke the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," which classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health. The scientists concluded that the 2009 finding is now supported by even stronger evidence, warning that the U.S. faces a future where climate-induced harm worsens. This highlights a significant conflict between the scientific community and current political policy.</p>

          <p>During a keynote address at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun urged vigilance against "hegemonic" alliances and military blocs. His speech, delivered to an international audience of defense officials, underscored China's security concerns in the Asia-Pacific region. The remarks are widely interpreted as a response to U.S.-led security partnerships, such as AUKUS and the Quad. The forum serves as a platform for China to project its military and diplomatic positions amid increasing strategic competition with the United States.</p>

Harris, who instead selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, offers a candid perspective on the complex electoral calculations surrounding identity in American politics.

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in parts of Africa consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails by eating naturally fermented fruits. Scientists chemically analyzed the figs and plums that are staples of the chimps' diet and measured their ethanol content. This discovery provides the first direct chemical evidence of regular alcohol consumption by wild primates. The findings lend strong support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits that the human attraction to alcohol has deep evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our ancestors.</p>

          <p>The office of California Governor Gavin Newsom has forcefully denied a claim made by former President Donald Trump that the state is approving low-income housing in the affluent Pacific Palisades area. Trump alleged on social media that this was occurring in an area affected by recent fires, calling it unfair to residents. Newsom's team responded by calling the claim a "straight up lie," pointing to a mayoral emergency order that currently bans such housing applications in the designated burn zone, effectively fact-checking the former president's statement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a cautious move intended to balance concerns about a slowing job market against persistent inflation. This decision is unlikely to appease former President Donald Trump, who has been publicly pressuring the central bank for much larger cuts and challenging its political independence. The situation is further complicated by Trump's recent appointment of a White House economic adviser to the Fed's board, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the politicization of monetary policy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts widely anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. However, with UK inflation remaining at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are expected to pause further cuts for the remainder of the year to avoid fueling price rises. This cautious approach contrasts with recent rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, reflecting different domestic economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer described the Fed as being in a tough position, balancing a weaker labor market with ongoing inflation, and praised Chair Jerome Powell's approach as prudent and steady in a complex economic environment.

The move aims to reduce borrowing costs to support local businesses and ease the burden on mortgage holders. The Fed's decision was influenced by signs of a weakening U.S. labor market, potentially marking the beginning of a global rate-cutting cycle. (not investment advice)</p>
