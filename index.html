          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned political violence while also suggesting President Trump's rhetoric often encourages it. Pritzker drew parallels to other recent acts of political violence and referenced the January 6th Capitol riot, comments which drew criticism from his Republican opponents. The exchange highlights the immediate politicization of the tragedy and the deep partisan divisions surrounding the issue of political violence in the United States.</p>

Jean Carroll sexual abuse case versus his association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While the civil court ruling in favor of Carroll caused little political damage, Trump's connection to Epstein has generated significant outrage within the MAGA movement. The author suggests this is because the defense of abused girls, unlike adult women, provides a source of unambiguous moral clarity that aligns with the movement's traditionalist values.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the rupture in the relationship between the United States and Europe is a deep, structural trend that will persist regardless of who is president. The author contends that demographic, societal, and economic forces are pushing the two powers apart, making a return to the close kinship of past decades unlikely. Europe is urged to accept this new reality and pursue strategic autonomy, as the alternative could be a world of competing empires where Europe is marginalized.</p>

          <p>Over the past five years, China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) in a major mineral exploration initiative, leading to significant discoveries of oil, gas, lithium, and other critical resources.

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first in-person meeting since February 2024. The reunion, which lasted about 50 minutes, is being viewed as a potential small step toward reconciliation after a period of significant public strain within the royal family. While details of the conversation remain private, the meeting itself is seen as a positive development, though a broader family reconciliation appears more distant.</p>
