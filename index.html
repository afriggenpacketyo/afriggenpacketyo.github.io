          <p>A woman was killed and five others were injured in a mass shooting at a large gathering on Chicago's West Side, one of three separate shootings in the same neighborhood within hours. Police responded to find multiple victims, including a 22-year-old woman who was pronounced dead at the hospital and several others in critical condition. No arrests have been made, and the motive is under investigation, highlighting a morning of significant gun violence in the South Austin area. The incidents underscore ongoing concerns about public safety and violent crime in the city.</p>

          <p>Since the Hamas attacks of October 2023, Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank have escalated their campaign to drive out Palestinian communities, backed by hardline government ministers. This article details how settler violence has sharply increased, with the UN reporting an average of four attacks per day, effectively transforming the landscape and extinguishing hopes for a Palestinian state. Settler leaders, viewing the current conflict as a divine opportunity, are expanding their presence while Palestinians face displacement and loss of land and livelihoods. The report contrasts the settlers' religious zeal with accusations of ethnic cleansing from human rights groups.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter posits that World War II was a pivotal, yet often underestimated, event in shaping modern China, fundamentally altering its trajectory. The war destroyed much of the nation's infrastructure from the 1920s and 30s, forcing a near-total rebuild and influencing its subsequent political and societal development. Mitter's research focuses on the profound impact of Japan's invasion on China's internal dynamics and culture. He suggests that this historical context informs China's contemporary interest in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

Lindsey's lawyer maintains his client's innocence, stating he was unaware the individuals were wanted by police and is cooperating with the investigation.

          <p>President Trump has called for the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington, D.C., suggesting they be relocated to distant facilities while threatening to jail criminals. In a series of social media posts, he floated the idea of a federal takeover of the city's policing to combat what he describes as rampant crime and squalor. This threat follows a surge of federal law enforcement into the capital, though official data indicates that violent crime in D.C. has actually been declining for the past year and a half. Advocacy groups have criticized the president's approach to homelessness and crime.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, the union representing its employees has demanded that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation, which they say puts scientists at risk. The union stated the attack, carried out by a gunman who believed vaccines had harmed him, was not random and compounded months of vilification of CDC staff. They called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a clear stance against disinformation to reinforce public trust in science. The union also requested that staff not be required to return to the office until the bullet-damaged buildings are fully repaired.</p>

          <p>NPR is launching a new series, "The World, Reordering," to examine the fracturing of the post-World War II global system. The series will feature reporting from international correspondents on the decline of the U.S.-led "liberal international order" amid the resurgence of authoritarian powers and shifting alliances. It will explore how many countries are preparing for a future with diminished American influence by forming new defense and security partnerships. The reporting aims to understand the forces reshaping international relations and what the groundwork for a new global structure might look like.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated his conflict with Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, threatening the standoff "could literally last years." Abbott stated he will call continuous 30-day special legislative sessions and have the absent Democrats arrested upon their return to Texas. The contentious plan, prompted by Donald Trump, aims to create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats, a crucial move as the GOP fights to maintain its slim House majority. Democratic governors in states where the lawmakers have taken refuge have vowed to fight back against what they call a "blatant power grab."</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he does not believe Crystal Palace fans had any "bad intention" when they disrupted a minute's silence before the Community Shield match. The silence, held for former Liverpool player Diogo Jota and his brother, was cut short after shouts were heard from the Palace supporters' end of Wembley Stadium. Slot suggested the noise was likely from a fan who was unaware of the silence and was simply cheering for their team, which then prompted other fans to try and quiet them. He described the incident as unlucky rather than malicious, noting the broader respect shown for the players' passing.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend the export of certain weapons to Israel that could be used in its planned Gaza City offensive. Merz stated that while Germany remains committed to Israel's self-defense, it cannot supply offensive arms to a conflict where many civilians could be killed, a move prompted by Israel's controversial plans. The decision has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative bloc but has been supported by his coalition partners and foreign policy experts. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu criticized the move, claiming Merz "buckled" under pressure from false news reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is facing scrutiny following the deaths of three patients who received a gene therapy treatment from Sarepta Therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The agency had granted the drug, which costs $3.2 million per patient, an accelerated approval in 2023 despite internal concerns over limited clinical data. Following the deaths from acute liver failure, the FDA has asked Sarepta to suspend the drug's distribution, causing the company's stock to plummet. The situation highlights the significant dilemmas and risks the FDA confronts when reviewing treatments for rare diseases with few available options.</p>

Bowser highlighted that official data shows a two-year decline in violent crime, directly contradicting White House claims of an "out-of-control" crisis used to justify surging federal officers into the city. While expressing willingness to work with the president on shared priorities, she asserted that a federal takeover is not legally warranted and that deploying the National Guard would be an inefficient use of resources.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey's northwestern Balikesir province, resulting in at least one death, 29 injuries, and the collapse of over a dozen buildings. The epicenter was in the town of Sindirgi, but tremors were felt as far as Istanbul, approximately 125 miles away. An elderly woman died after being rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building, while most of the other destroyed structures were reportedly derelict. Authorities have issued several aftershock warnings and urged residents to avoid entering damaged buildings as rescue efforts continue.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte characterized the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a crucial test to determine if the Russian leader is serious about ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rutte praised Trump's strategy, including increased NATO defense spending and allowing U.S. weapons into Ukraine, as moves that put pressure on Russia. While emphasizing that Ukraine must ultimately be involved in any territorial negotiations, he sees the bilateral summit in Alaska as an important first step to potentially break the diplomatic deadlock. Rutte assured that NATO's military support for Ukraine will continue regardless of the meeting's outcome.</p>

          <p>Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has issued a stark warning that the U.S. economy is on the brink of a recession, pointing to a "telling" sign from the labor market. He noted that over 53% of U.S. industries are now shedding jobs, a pattern that has historically accompanied economic downturns, even as headline employment numbers remain positive for now. Zandi cautioned that initial jobs data is often revised down during economic turning points, suggesting a contraction may already be underway, with only the healthcare sector showing meaningful growth.
