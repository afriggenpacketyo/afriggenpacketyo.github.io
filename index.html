        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study based on data from the European Social Survey indicates that parents in Europe, particularly mothers, experience lower life satisfaction compared to child-free individuals, despite finding deeper meaning in life through parenthood. The study highlights that factors such as single parenthood, young age, and low educational qualifications contribute to decreased satisfaction levels. Scandinavian countries show less pronounced differences in satisfaction between parents and non-parents due to supportive family policies and greater gender equality. The researchers suggest that societal support for parents and gender equality in both family and business culture play a crucial role in enhancing parental satisfaction. This emphasizes the importance of community and policy in supporting families. </p>

The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but it has faced criticism for overlooking broader economic struggles and stigmatizing overweight individuals.

          <p>The Football Association's (FA) ban on transgender women playing in women's football has commenced, impacting approximately 28 registered transgender women in England. This decision, following a UK Supreme Court ruling, restricts participation in FA-affiliated women's football to individuals born biologically female. Billie Sky, a transgender woman who recently helped her team earn promotion, is now unable to play competitively for them. While Sky can still participate informally for Goal Diggers FC, the policy has sparked debate about inclusion, sporting fairness, and safety in women's sports. The FA describes the issue as a "complex subject," highlighting the ongoing challenges in balancing competing interests. </p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's inconsistent approach to China, characterized by both aggression and weakness, is increasing the likelihood of a conflict over Taiwan. Trump's trade policies and tariffs are seen as provocative and potentially undermining the Chinese Communist Party's control. China may exploit Trump's reluctance to engage in military conflicts, potentially leading to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. The author suggests that Trump's policies are driven by self-interest and fear, rather than principles or alliances, making Taiwan a vulnerable target. This article discusses the geopolitical risks associated with Trump's foreign policy. </p>

She shares anecdotes of patients whose encounters with mortality led them to reconsider their priorities and seek reconciliation, connection, or long-postponed dreams. Rather than advocating for extravagant bucket lists, Puri suggests that contemplating death encourages a deeper appreciation for the ordinary and a reconciliation between the life we have and the one we longed for. By acknowledging the uncertainty of when and how death will arrive, individuals can find a unique freedom to live more intentionally.
