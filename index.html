          <p>A shooting at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, has resulted in multiple victims. Authorities confirmed that the suspected shooter is "down" and there is no longer an active threat to the public. In addition to the violence, the church building was also set on fire, though the flames have since been contained by emergency crews. Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the act, and federal agencies including the FBI are assisting local law enforcement with the ongoing investigation at the dynamic scene.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky addressed the looming government shutdown, criticizing both Republican and Democratic spending proposals for increasing the national debt. He advocated for his own "penny plan" to balance the budget over five years, though it failed to pass. Paul also discussed the president's executive authority, stating that courts have consistently upheld the president's power to hire and fire executive branch employees. He commented on the deployment of federal agents to cities like Portland, acknowledging the federal government's role in protecting federal property but expressing a preference for state and local cooperation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a government shutdown deadline fast approaching, Republican congressional leaders are insisting that the debate over extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits should be handled separately from the immediate need to fund the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated that while they are open to discussing the ACA subsidies, the priority is to pass a funding bill to keep federal agencies open. Democrats, however, are firm on linking the two issues, warning that millions of Americans could face soaring insurance premiums if the credits expire at year's end.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is hopeful that a government shutdown can be avoided ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Trump and congressional leaders. Jeffries emphasized the Democratic position that any spending agreement must include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits to prevent a dramatic increase in healthcare costs for millions of Americans. He argued that waiting until the end of the year is not feasible, as notices of premium hikes would soon be sent out. This stance highlights the primary point of contention in the high-stakes negotiations to keep the government funded.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with the top four congressional leaders in a final attempt to prevent a government shutdown as the funding deadline approaches. The meeting follows a previously canceled discussion, with Democrats insisting that an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits be included in any funding deal. Republicans argue this issue can be debated later, accusing Democrats of holding the government hostage. With federal agencies preparing for furloughs, the outcome of this high-stakes negotiation remains uncertain, though the president is reportedly not optimistic about reaching an agreement.</p>

          <p>In a surprisingly close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system. The proposal, which passed with 50.4% of the vote, will create an optional digital ID stored on users' smartphones, managed by the government. This vote follows a 2021 rejection of a similar plan that raised privacy concerns over private sector involvement. The revised system is designed to enhance data protection by decentralizing storage and limiting data access, aiming to streamline online bureaucratic processes while respecting Switzerland's strong tradition of citizen privacy.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a public health crisis as diabetes prevalence has nearly doubled over the past two decades, now affecting over 16% of its adult population, the highest rate in Europe. Experts attribute the dramatic rise to national food policies, lack of exercise, and high consumption of carbohydrates and starch-based sugars. Critics, including public health professor Kayihan Pala, argue that the government has failed to implement effective preventative measures, combat obesity, or ensure adequate post-diagnosis care. The situation is compounded by a high number of undiagnosed cases and insufficient treatment for those who are diagnosed.</p>

However, Kim reiterated that his country's nuclear arsenal is non-negotiable, a stance that directly conflicts with the U.S. goal of complete denuclearization.

Concurrently, the looming threat of a government shutdown adds another layer of uncertainty, as President Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders to negotiate a funding bill. The performance of the Treasury market will also be a key indicator of economic sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Leader Keir Starmer Denounces Reform UK's Immigration Policy as 'Racist'</h2>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, would require legal migrants to reapply for visas under stricter rules and could lead to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people lawfully residing in the country. While labeling the policy itself as racist, Starmer clarified that he believes Reform supporters are not racist but are frustrated with years of Conservative government failures. The comments come as Starmer's Labour party faces sliding poll ratings and pressure from Reform's populist platform.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, has been placed on paid administrative leave after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The Des Moines school board stated it was unaware of any immigration issues, noting that multiple background checks revealed no problems and that Roberts had affirmed he was a U.S. citizen. Roberts, who previously competed in the 2000 Olympics for Guyana, had stated he grew up in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid skepticism about official government statistics, alternative data sources are offering a different perspective on the true rate of inflation. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) methodology is considered robust, it can have limitations like outdated consumer spending weights. Data from sources like Truflation, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), and Zillow provide a more real-time and varied picture. Currently, these alternative indicators suggest that consumer price increases may be lower than government figures, though rising prices reported by business organizations like ISM and NFIB suggest future inflationary pressures are building.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is pioneering a new industrial "pull system" designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach inverts the traditional "push" model, where components are made based on forecasts. Instead, the final assembly line pulls parts from suppliers only as they are needed, aiming to reduce delays, lower costs, and increase production flexibility and quality. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the future of the space industry and meeting the surging demand for orbital launches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With more prime commercial space available, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied. This shift is allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to move into locations they were previously priced out of. While the trend varies by region, the overall softening of demand is enabling a new mix of local tenants to revitalize struggling retail corridors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed against him for spreading false claims about the 2020 presidential election. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a key figure in promoting the conspiracy theory that Dominion's machines were rigged. This marks the third major settlement for Dominion, following substantial payouts from Fox News and Newsmax for their roles in amplifying the election lies. The resolution comes as Giuliani faces significant financial and professional consequences, including disbarment and a separate $148 million judgment owed to two Georgia election workers he defamed.</p>

          <p>Michael Cohen, former lawyer for Donald Trump, expressed his belief that former FBI Director James Comey "committed a crime" during an appearance on MSNBC, stunning the panel of hosts. Cohen, who has become a prominent Trump critic, claimed his own investigation suggested Comey was negatively involved in the Russia probe. Drawing from his personal experience with what he called a "weaponized DOJ," Cohen argued that the government's access to vast amounts of documents makes it likely that Comey will be found guilty of an unspecified crime. The hosts were visibly surprised by his confident assertion against the newly-indicted former director.</p>
