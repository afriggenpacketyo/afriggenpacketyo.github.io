          <p>Charles Tillman, a former NFL star, revealed he resigned from the FBI due to disagreements with the Trump administration's immigration policies. In an interview, Tillman stated that the directive to target non-dangerous immigrants conflicted with his conscience and his desire to be on the right side of history. He explained that his financial stability from his football career allowed him to walk away from a job where he felt his colleagues were also uncomfortable with the orders coming from Washington. The article highlights a personal story of principle clashing with federal policy during a period of intense immigration enforcement.</p>

CEO Julie Sweet stated that while the company's primary goal is upskilling its workforce, it will be "exiting" staff on a compressed timeline where retraining is not a viable path. This move is part of an $865 million business optimization program, which Accenture expects will generate over $1 billion in savings to be reinvested into its AI talent and business growth.

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party to a significant election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing growing criticism and doubt from within his own party and government. An analysis reveals widespread frustration over his leadership style, perceived lack of a clear vision, and poor communication, which has been reflected in months of negative polling.

          <p>Iran has recalled its ambassadors from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in a significant diplomatic move. The decision followed the failure of a China and Russia-backed resolution at the UN Security Council that aimed to prevent the reimposition of global sanctions against Tehran. Iranian state media reported that officials condemned the process as "bullying and illegal," asserting that the country would not yield to pressure. Tehran stated it remains open to dialogue based on mutual respect but will respond decisively to any policy of threats.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that broadcast media companies Nexstar and Sinclair overplayed their hand in their standoff with ABC over Jimmy Kimmel's show. After initially forcing Kimmel's suspension, the two companies, which own a large number of local ABC affiliates, refused to air his show upon his return. However, they quickly reversed course and reinstated the program, effectively conceding defeat. The article argues that the boycott was economically unsustainable for the local stations, as they faced lower viewership with replacement programming and risked losing valuable network content like college football, highlighting the enduring power of networks over their affiliates.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react to potential runway collisions. The technology aims to address a recent spike in serious near-misses at U.S. airports, which averaged 4.5 runway incursions per day last year. By using GPS-based ADS-B data, the system can provide warnings seconds earlier than current technology, a critical advantage in high-stakes situations. While not yet required by regulators, the NTSB has urged the adoption of such advanced alerts to enhance airport safety.</p>

          <p>Following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, legal experts suggest that President Trump's years of public attacks and recent calls for his prosecution could backfire. Comey's defense may argue for dismissal based on selective or vindictive prosecution, citing the president's clear animus as evidence. The case is further complicated by the abrupt replacement of the top prosecutor in the Virginia office with a Trump loyalist with no prosecutorial experience just days before the charges were filed. This context, combined with reported opposition from career prosecutors, provides strong grounds for the defense to challenge the indictment's legitimacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for high-skill foreign workers is facing criticism from economists. Britta Glennon of the Wharton School argues the policy would hurt the U.S. economy and American workers by stifling innovation and entrepreneurship, areas where immigrants significantly contribute. Research suggests that restricting skilled immigration leads companies to offshore jobs rather than hire domestically. While the administration claims the fee will protect American jobs and address program abuses, critics contend it's a blunt instrument that will disproportionately harm startups and make the U.S. less attractive to global talent.

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto moves through the Atlantic, forecasters are watching for a potential interaction with another developing storm system nearby. This rare phenomenon, known as the Fujiwhara effect, occurs when two tropical storms get close enough to orbit a common center or merge. In this case, since Humberto is significantly stronger, it would likely absorb the weaker system rather than engage in a gravitational "dance." While a direct collision remains unlikely, the possibility adds a layer of complexity to the forecast, as such interactions can slightly alter the storms' predicted paths and intensity.</p>

          <p>Immigrants held at a new, privately-run ICE detention center in California City are describing the conditions as "hell on earth," citing filthy cells, inadequate food, and a lack of medical care. Detainees at the CoreCivic facility, which opened in August, allege that staff have been unprepared, hostile, and have threatened them with solitary confinement for minor issues. The remote desert facility was opened rapidly as part of the Trump administration's push to expand detention capacity. Advocates and some city officials argue the center is operating unlawfully without the proper permits, compounding concerns over the alleged mistreatment.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, the Trump administration has launched a broad assault on free speech, including forcing the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel and threatening to revoke TV network licenses. This has created a rift on the political right, with libertarian and some conservative voices warning against the abandonment of First Amendment principles. Critics from organizations like the Cato Institute argue that Trump is practicing a "free speech for me, but not for thee" policy, using government power to suppress dissent. This authoritarian turn marks a departure from traditional conservative support for free expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's strategy of openly flaunting potentially corrupt actions serves to normalize them and dull their political impact. Unlike past presidents who sought to conceal misconduct, Trump often broadcasts his intentions, such as his public calls for the Justice Department to prosecute his political rivals like James Comey. This brazenness, combined with the sheer volume of controversies, creates a sense of background noise that desensitizes the public and media. For his supporters, this behavior is often interpreted as authenticity and a rebellion against established norms, rather than an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is nearing a shutdown as Congress struggles to pass a funding agreement before the October 1st deadline. This year's threat is particularly serious, as the White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for permanent mass layoffs, not just temporary furloughs, in programs that lose funding. The standoff is caused by deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans over spending priorities, including healthcare subsidies and Medicaid cuts. With President Trump canceling negotiations and both sides dug in, there is little time to avert a lapse in funding that could have severe consequences for federal workers.</p>

          <p>In response to low approval ratings and an alarming political climate, many Democrats are shifting their communication style to be angrier, more direct, and frequently more profane. The party is attempting to shed its image of being weak and out of touch, with leaders now advocating for "bringing a knife to a knife fight." This change involves embracing social media trends, trolling opponents, and using gut-level rhetoric to connect with voters who are frustrated with poll-tested talking points. The move reflects a broader strategic effort to sound more authentic and punch back harder against the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum directing federal law enforcement to focus on "domestic terrorism," a move critics fear is a pretext for a broad crackdown on the political left. Signed after the killing of Charlie Kirk, the memo and accompanying remarks from administration officials linked left-wing movements like Black Lives Matter and antifa to an organized terror campaign. Legal scholars and civil rights advocates have condemned the action as a "chilling" threat to free speech that echoes repressive historical periods like McCarthyism. They argue it weaponizes the government to target political opponents under the guise of national security.</p>

          <p>A recent anecdote from Leonardo DiCaprio, who was advised to change his name to "Lenny Williams" early in his career, highlights a long-standing issue in Hollywood. This column reflects on how actors with so-called "ethnic" names have historically been pressured to adopt more anglicized stage names to improve their chances of success. The author uses a short fable about an aspiring actor who constantly changes his appearance to match others, only to be told the key is to be himself. The piece celebrates that actors like DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro ultimately rejected such advice and found success on their own terms.</p>

          <p>A new NPR-Ipsos poll reveals that while about seven in ten Americans believe crime in U.S. cities is at an unacceptable level, there is no broad support for President Trump's strategy of deploying the National Guard to police them. The survey indicates a significant partisan divide on the issue, with a majority of Republicans supporting the tactic while a similar majority of Democrats oppose it. Independents also tend to oppose the use of troops, with many viewing it as an overreach of presidential power. The findings suggest that despite widespread concern about crime, the administration's proposed solution is highly controversial.</p>

          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" may help indicate an increased risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing your thumb across your flat palm; if it extends beyond the edge, it could suggest joint hypermobility associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome, which weaken blood vessel walls. Cardiologists caution that the test is not diagnostic, as most aneurysm patients have a negative result, and a positive result doesn't confirm an aneurysm is present. However, they advise that a positive test should prompt a discussion with a doctor about further evaluation, especially if other risk factors exist.</p>

The first state fair was held in Syracuse, New York, in 1841, and while agriculture and craft competitions remain a core element, modern fairs have expanded to become major entertainment hubs.
