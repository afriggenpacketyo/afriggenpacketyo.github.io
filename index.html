          <p>Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia passed away at the age of 75, according to a statement from his family. Connolly had served in Congress since 2009 and was known as a champion for federal workers, especially during the Trump administration and Elon Musk's government overhaul. Just last month, Connolly stepped down from his leadership position on the House Oversight Committee due to the return of his cancer, which he was initially diagnosed with in November. He had previously defeated Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for the committee chair position in December, and his family expressed pride in his life's work, which will endure for future generations.</p>

          <p>A Vox article revisits Charles Murray's 2015 book, "By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission," arguing that its anti-government radicalism foreshadowed Donald Trump's second term. Murray advocated for wealthy donors to fund civil disobedience against the regulatory state, reflecting a skepticism of democracy and faith in the wealthy over the law. The article suggests that Murray's ideas help explain why mainstream conservatives have been comfortable with Trump's actions, as they share a belief that the American government is no longer worthy of respect. The author posits that Trump's administration, influenced by figures like Elon Musk, has sought to undermine federal agencies and disregard legal boundaries, echoing Murray's vision of a state unworthy of citizens' allegiance.</p>

He left Ukraine after the revolution, returned in 2019 after Volodymyr Zelensky's election, and was later sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2021 for allegedly undermining reform efforts.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corporation announced that the redesigned 2026 Toyota RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, marking the first time the vehicle will not include a traditional gas engine. The decision to move to an all-hybrid lineup is driven by the increasing popularity and customer demand for hybrid vehicles, as well as the need to meet fuel economy regulations. Toyota's electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of its U.S. sales in 2024, and the company expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign that includes interior and exterior changes, along with upgrades to performance and technologies.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has reportedly encircled two of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza, raising concerns from aid groups and the World Health Organization, which warns that the health system is stretched beyond its breaking point. The Indonesian hospital and al-Awda hospital are among the few remaining medical centers in the area, and Israeli forces are said to be operating around them, targeting Hamas infrastructure. However, reports indicate that Israeli bulldozers demolished a perimeter wall of the Indonesian hospital, and airstrikes damaged its main power supply, resulting in at least one staff member's death. Meanwhile, Israeli drones fired into the al-Awda hospital courtyard, preventing movement and targeting ambulances.</p>

          <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell cautioned about the potential for "massive costs" due to tariffs, stating that the company would only raise prices as a last resort. The retail giant's warning follows similar concerns from Walmart and Best Buy. Target reported a drop in sales for its most recent quarter, attributing it to consumer anxiety over tariffs and backlash from the rollback of its diversity, equity, and inclusion policy. Cornell expressed concern over the decline in consumer confidence and the uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of tariffs. A recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China has eased some tariff pressures, but an array of tariffs remain in place.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt public funding for fossil fuels at the 2022 G7 summit, Japan remains a world leader in funding natural gas projects. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese public financial institutions invested $93 billion in oil and gas projects, with $56 billion allocated to overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. This contrasts with the $24.5 billion invested in clean energy projects during the same period. Japan's involvement in LNG is part of a broader strategy to ensure energy security and resell surplus LNG, although a 2024 study found that LNG involves 33% more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered.</p>

Afrikaner lobby groups have actively engaged with Trump, lobbying for action against the South African government, even though Trump's comments have caused concern in South Africa.

          <p>Human rights groups and digital rights advocates are increasingly concerned that Pakistan's cybercrime law is being used to silence critical voices, particularly journalists. The amended Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) criminalizes the dissemination of false information online that could incite fear or unrest, with penalties including imprisonment and fines. Several journalists have been detained under PECA for reporting on sensitive topics, such as the alleged role of Pakistan's military. Critics argue that the law is a draconian measure that impinges on journalistic freedom and stifles dissent, while the government maintains that it is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.</p>

          <p>Three days after Israel announced it would ease its blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, very little, if any, of the desperately needed food, fuel and medicine has reached Palestinians. Dozens of trucks ferrying supplies have crossed into Gaza at the Israeli-controlled border crossing of Kerem Shalom, according to Israel. But the United Nations has so far been unable to move any trucks from Kerem Shalom to warehouses inside Gaza, according to two U.N. officials, who requested anonymity to share sensitive details. The spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza has ignited growing international opprobrium against the Israeli campaign against Hamas. Britain, France, and Canada have denounced the Israeli blockade and planned ground offensive in unusually stark and harsh terms, labeling them “disproportionate” and “egregious.”</p>

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among the powerful market players who influence interest rates, according to a New York Times article. Bond investors were already on edge over President Trump’s whipsawing tariff policy, and now this week’s attempt to push through sweeping tax cuts without significantly slashing spending set off a fresh bout of bond market turmoil. Since dropping below 4 percent in early April, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen back above 4.5 percent, a large move reflecting deficit worries. The moves for the 30-year yield this year have also been stark: It has jumped above 5 percent, its highest level in about a year and a half. Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, warned that volatility in the Treasury market could add to already heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.</p>

China urged the U.S. to abandon the project and take actions to enhance strategic trust between major countries.

          <p>A growing trend sees states banning or regulating cellphone use in schools, with 25 states having passed laws and more states considering action. This reflects a consensus that phones are detrimental to students' well-being and academic performance. Some states are implementing school day bans, while others mandate that districts set their own policies. While opposition exists from some parents and students, exceptions are being made for medical needs, special education plans, and emergencies. Some states are providing funding for storage solutions, but most are not, and the focus is shifting towards more comprehensive bans throughout the school day.</p>

          <p>Israel declared this week that it was expanding its ground offensive in Gaza, vowing to seize large areas of the enclave in an effort to force the surrender of Hamas after more than 19 months of war, according to the New York Times. The threat came during a new and intense round of cease-fire negotiations and as the Trump administration presses both sides to agree to a truce. The Israeli military has said that Hamas could halt the advance by releasing the hostages it holds. Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare public reprimand of Israel this week, demanding that it cease its widening military offensive in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cautioned that a "fundamental regime change" could be occurring in financial markets as investors reassess the riskiness of U.S. assets due to trade tariffs. In its latest Financial Stability Review, the ECB noted that markets have been reacting sensitively to trade tensions driven by U.S. tariff policy. The ECB highlighted that during the turmoil, market functioning in the euro area held up well, despite some shifts away from traditional safe havens like US Treasuries and the US dollar.

          <p>The case of a brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia has sparked legal and ethical questions regarding the state's abortion law, according to NPR. Doctors at Emory University Hospital have been maintaining the woman's organs until the fetus can be delivered, citing Georgia's law banning most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. This decision has prompted debate over the interpretation of the law, fetal personhood, and medical ethics. While the state's Attorney General stated that removing life support is not an action "with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy," Emory Healthcare has not addressed the legal opinion.</p>

The experience highlighted the downsides of constant social media use and the benefits of spontaneous, off-the-cuff hangs.

But he was best known for “Cheers.” He appeared on every episode of the sitcom during its 11-year run on NBC, beginning in 1982. His streak of Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series began in 1984.</p>
