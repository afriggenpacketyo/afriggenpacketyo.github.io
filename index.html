          <h2>Trump Enacts First Major Federal Cryptocurrency Legislation</h2>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, specifically targeting stablecoins. The bipartisan bill aims to increase public trust and mainstream adoption by making it easier for banks to issue these digital currencies, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. However, the legislation has drawn criticism from some Democrats, like Rep. Maxine Waters, who raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, pointing to a crypto firm with strong ties to the Trump family that could directly benefit from the new law.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training academy in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deceased were described as elite experts from the Arson Explosives Detail, representing the department's largest loss of life since 1857. Sheriff Robert Luna stated that the investigation is in its early stages, but sources suggest the blast may have been accidentally triggered by hazardous materials recovered a day prior, rather than being a training accident. Federal agencies are assisting in the ongoing investigation to determine the exact cause of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured the release of ten Americans detained in Venezuela, including a former Navy SEAL, through a complex prisoner swap. The exchange involved El Salvador returning 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. earlier this year over alleged gang ties. In return for the release of the Americans and some Venezuelan political prisoners, El Salvador transferred the Venezuelan detainees from its custody. The initial U.S. deportation of the Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act had been a point of contention, with families denying the gang affiliations.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a significant reaction to President Trump signing the GENIUS Act, with Ether (ETH) leading the gains and reaching its highest price since January. Ether-tracking ETFs experienced record inflows, surpassing those of Bitcoin ETFs for the first time, signaling a potential shift in crypto market leadership.

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin has claimed that FBI personnel reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's case files were directed to flag any documents mentioning President Trump. This revelation comes as Trump faces pressure to release all records related to the disgraced financier, especially after a Wall Street Journal report detailed a lewd birthday card allegedly sent from Trump to Epstein. In response to the growing controversy, Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the case. However, legal experts note that releasing such transcripts is rare and would likely be heavily redacted if approved by a court.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. The decision is a major strategic victory for Chevron, resolving uncertainty that had weighed on its stock. While Exxon stated it respects the ruling, its shares fell on the news, highlighting the high stakes involved in controlling the lucrative Guyanese oil project.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that even high-income individuals, earning $300,000 or more, often struggle with credit card debt, largely due to "lifestyle creep" where expenses rise with income. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for these earners, who can leverage their strong credit scores and financial standing. Options include using a debt consolidation loan to secure a lower interest rate, or transferring balances to a card with a 0% introductory APR. The article also suggests negotiating directly with creditors for a lower rate or working with a financial advisor to create a disciplined, personalized payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Colbert's Cancellation Signals the End of an Era for Political Comedy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece argues that the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is more than a financial decision; it symbolizes the decline of the political comedy genre that he and Jon Stewart pioneered. The article traces the rise of this comedy style during the George W. Bush era, when it felt urgent and subversive, to its current state as a mainstream institution that has struggled to remain relevant in the Trump era. The author suggests that CBS's decision, potentially influenced by political pressure from the Trump administration, ironically renders Colbert's mainstream comedy dangerous once again, marking a fraught moment for media and satire.</p>

          <p>A tragic murder-suicide has left two young children in Garden Grove, California, without their parents. Police believe that 35-year-old Miguel Lopez killed his wife, 37-year-old Crystal Gonzalez, at their home before driving over 300 miles north to Stockton. Once there, he shot and critically injured another man before taking his own life. The couple's two children were found unharmed inside the Garden Grove home after one of them called police for help for their mother. Authorities are investigating the motive for the violence and are working to reunite the orphaned children with other family members.</p>

          <p>This feature article explores the long and varied history of queerness, challenging the modern perception of a strict gender binary as a historical norm. It highlights periods of acceptance, such as in ancient Greece and Rome where same-sex relationships were common, and points to figures like Leonardo da Vinci who likely had male lovers. The article contrasts this with eras of persecution, often justified by religious doctrine, which criminalized non-normative identities. It also discusses the recognition of a third gender in many cultures, from the Hijras in South Asia to the Muxes in Mexico, providing a global perspective on gender diversity through time.</p>

          <p>The parents of Kaylee Goncalves, one of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022, say they still lack a clear motive for the killings, even after Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty. With a gag order now lifted, the family hopes to access police reports and other evidence to understand why their daughter was targeted. The Goncalves family had opposed the plea deal, which spared Kohberger the death penalty in exchange for a life sentence, arguing it did not provide full accountability. They expressed frustration at knowing little more than the public and want the full, "ugly" truth of the crime to be revealed.</p>

          <p>American Express reported strong second-quarter spending, indicating its affluent customer base continues to spend freely on its cards. Overall spending rose 7%, driven by transactions for goods and services, which has helped insulate the company from fears of a broader economic slowdown. However, a notable weak spot has emerged in travel, with spending on airline tickets coming in flat compared to last year, specifically due to a decline in domestic economy-class airfare purchases. While premium cabin and luxury hotel bookings remain strong, the stall in airfare spending could be a concern for the rewards-focused company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle crash in San Antonio, Texas, has left four people dead and sixteen others injured after a stolen car speeding on an interstate highway collided with a bus. According to police, the impact caused the bus driver to lose control, leading to a collision with a guardrail before a tractor-trailer smashed into the bus, causing it to roll over. Several people were ejected from the bus, and two were pronounced dead at the scene.

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account. While a money market account currently offers a slightly higher variable interest rate and greater flexibility, a CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return over its term. Calculations show that based on current rates, a money market account would earn slightly more over several years, but this assumes rates will not fall. The article concludes that savers must weigh the guaranteed, albeit slightly lower, return of a CD against the potentially higher but uncertain returns of a money market account.

          <p>This article provides a detailed history of the relationship between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, contextualizing a recent Wall Street Journal report about a cryptic birthday message. Their friendship, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, involved frequent socializing at parties in New York and Palm Beach. The piece recounts Trump's 2002 praise of Epstein as a "terrific guy" and notes that the two had a bitter falling-out in 2004 over a real estate deal. While victims have not accused Trump of involvement in Epstein's crimes, the article explains how their long and documented association continues to fuel public scrutiny and speculation.</p>

This conflict creates uncertainty for consumers, as a premature rate cut could reignite inflation, while keeping rates high prolongs elevated borrowing costs for mortgages, loans, and credit cards.

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley challenges the centuries-old story that the two young princes, Edward and Richard, were murdered in the Tower of London by their uncle, Richard III. After a decade-long research project, Langley claims to have found significant evidence that both princes survived and lived on in secret. The project uncovered documents supporting a rebellion led by a boy "called" a son of King Edward IV, suggesting this was the elder prince, Edward V. This new thesis reframes one of history's most famous cold cases as a missing persons investigation, shifting the burden of proof onto those who maintain the traditional murder narrative.</p>
