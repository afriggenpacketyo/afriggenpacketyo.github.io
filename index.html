          <p>Following a prolonged legal challenge from media organizations, the Uvalde school district in Texas has released a trove of public records related to the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting. The documents include personnel files, text messages, and emails from school officials and police officers who were present during the tragic event that claimed 21 lives. This release aims to provide greater transparency into the heavily criticized law enforcement response, where officers waited over an hour to confront the gunman. The information is expected to shed more light on the communication and leadership failures that occurred.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have mutually agreed to extend a pause on certain tariffs for an additional 90 days, continuing a temporary truce in their ongoing trade dispute. The U.S. president confirmed the extension via an executive order, stating that all other elements of their existing agreement will remain unchanged. China’s Commerce Ministry subsequently announced it would also suspend its additional tariffs on U.S. goods for the same period. This move provides a brief window of stability, delaying the re-escalation of trade tensions between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of explosions at the U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works plant south of Pittsburgh has resulted in at least one fatality, numerous injuries, and one person initially reported missing. The incident, which occurred in a mechanical regulating room, prompted a large-scale emergency response from over a dozen local fire departments and EMS services. While the plant has since been stabilized and an initial stay-at-home order for nearby residents was lifted, the event has deeply shaken the community. U.S. Steel has stated its top priority is the safety of its employees and is cooperating with authorities to investigate the cause.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a significant heatwave, with temperatures expected to peak in the low-to-mid 30s Celsius across much of England and Wales, prompting amber heat health alerts. This prolonged period of hot and dry weather has exacerbated water shortages, with the national drought group declaring a "nationally significant" shortfall. The conditions are impacting agriculture, damaging wildlife habitats, and increasing the risk of wildfires. While the intense heat is forecast to ease slightly with potential thunderstorms, another rise in temperatures is anticipated for the upcoming weekend.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging the White House to halt a Republican-led effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, warning of a potential "redistricting arms race." With Texas Democrats leaving the state to block a quorum, Newsom sent a letter threatening that California could redraw its own maps to create more Democratic-leaning seats to offset any gains Republicans might achieve in Texas. The governor stated a preference for independent commissions but asserted that California cannot stand by during what he termed a "power grab." This standoff highlights the escalating partisan battles over electoral map-making across the country.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from their sales of specific AI chips to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses, allowing the companies to sell advanced chips like Nvidia's H20 to the Chinese market, a practice previously restricted due to national security concerns. The president described the deal as a negotiation that benefits the country, though the arrangement of a direct revenue share for export licenses is unprecedented. The move aims to balance corporate interests with geopolitical strategy in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The talks will not include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a decision that has raised concerns among European allies about a potential agreement favoring Russia. The president has indicated that any potential deal could involve land swaps, as he presses for a ceasefire in the long-running conflict.</p>

Researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are filtering water to detect environmental DNA (eDNA), or genetic traces left behind by the elusive creatures. This method has become crucial as traditional net surveys often come up empty, with the wild population having plummeted from an estimated 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014. The eDNA has confirmed their presence in protected refuge areas, offering a sliver of hope for the species' resilience if its habitat can be restored.</p>

The article points out the irony of right-wing figures, who previously decried supposed "police state" tactics, now supporting the president's actions.

          <p>In a significant reversal, President Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and praised his "amazing story," just days after publicly demanding his immediate resignation over alleged conflicts of interest. The initial call for resignation came after a senator questioned Tan's past ties to China. Following a meeting that included cabinet members, the president announced that Tan would be working with his administration on future suggestions. This sudden shift in tone highlights the administration's volatile but hands-on approach to the semiconductor industry as it navigates the complex technological competition with China.

          <p>The United States and China engaged in a sharp diplomatic clash at the United Nations Security Council regarding influence over the Panama Canal. The U.S. ambassador expressed concern over Beijing's "outsized influence" on the canal's critical infrastructure, suggesting it could pose a threat to global trade and security. In response, China's ambassador accused the U.S. of fabricating lies as a pretext to regain control of the strategic waterway. The exchange occurred during a meeting chaired by Panama's president, who reiterated his country's sovereignty and the canal's permanent neutrality.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, extending their partnership with the streaming giant. However, the new "first-look" arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content. Under the new pact, the couple will continue to develop film and television projects, including a second season of Meghan's cooking show and a film adaptation of a romance novel. The original partnership produced several high-profile projects, including the popular docuseries "Harry & Meghan."</p>

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey, are facing a fourth day with little to no water service after a 140-year-old water main broke last week. The break has left thousands of customers with extremely low pressure and nearly 200,000 people in the area under a boil water advisory. Officials have set up portable showers and are distributing bottled water, but residents remain frustrated by the prolonged outage. Repairs have been complicated by the need for custom-made pipes, with officials now hoping to complete the work by Tuesday night, though the advisory will likely last longer.</p>

His efforts were crucial in defending their total of 163-6, a score bolstered by a quickfire 29 from 20-year-old Ben McKinney on his debut.

Following the president's announcement on social media, gold futures saw a significant drop.
