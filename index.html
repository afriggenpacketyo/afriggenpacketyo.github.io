          <p>Six people were injured in an attack at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails, shouting "free Palestine" during the incident. The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of violence and terrorism, with victims ranging in age from 67 to 88. Authorities are conducting law enforcement activity in El Paso County, and the injured were treated at local hospitals. The attack has been widely condemned as a heinous act of hate targeting the Jewish community. The FBI is continuing its investigation into the incident. </p>

          <p>China refuted accusations from the U.S. that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, claiming instead that the U.S. is undermining the consensus reached. Tensions have escalated after the Trump administration imposed export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, and announced visa revocations for Chinese students. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions "seriously undermine" the Geneva deal, promising countermeasures to protect China's interests. China has maintained strict control over rare earths exports, contrary to U.S. expectations. Despite the strained relations, there is speculation that Trump and President Xi Jinping may discuss trade soon. This comes amidst broader tensions between the U.S. and China, including military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region. </p>

Todd and Julie had been convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion in 2022 and were serving sentences in separate federal institutions. Chase shared a Fox News post about his parents' return to Nashville, calling it the "best birthday gift I could ask for." Todd Chrisley credited faith, family, and fitness for helping him through incarceration, and he maintained contact with his children and wife through daily communication.

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks experienced a surge after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The merger will create a new company listed in Sydney, acquiring all outstanding shares of both entities, with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated that the deal simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company. This merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers, but critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium. </p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the first nation to select judges and magistrates through popular vote. Supporters believe this will overhaul the judicial system, which is known for corruption and inefficiency. Critics argue the vote will politicize the judiciary in a country already struggling with crime and gang violence. Voters were tasked with electing approximately 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates, with another election planned for 2027. Turnout appeared low as many voters struggled to choose from numerous unknown candidates, with some expressing concerns about pressure to vote or disillusionment with the system.</p>

          <p>Ukraine says it completed its largest long-range attack of the war with Russia, using smuggled drones to launch strikes on 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. The attacks come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators head to Istanbul for a second round of peace talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the "Spider's Web" operation by the SBU security service, striking "34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers." The SBU estimated the damage to Russia's strategic aviation was worth about $7bn. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities reported a massive drone and missile attack on its territory, injuring at least six people in Kharkiv.</p>

Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. He has been federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China.

The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity, stating that FIFA's new tournament increases players' workload without regard for their well-being. FIFA will pay MLS teams significant amounts to participate, but the league has allegedly refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement caps player earnings at 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, up to $1 million for the team. The MLSPA claims the league has failed to offer a reasonable proposal to change this arrangement. </p>

Immigration lawyer Álex Gálvez noted that the Trump administration is manipulating laws to achieve mass deportations. Citizens should not fear questioning upon return, but residents may face scrutiny from officials, particularly if they have been outside the country for over six months or have a criminal record. Gálvez advises residents planning to stay abroad for extended periods to seek permission and those with criminal records to consult an immigration lawyer to assess deportation risks. Individuals with DACA and TPS status face similar risks and should seek advance parole before traveling.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado expressed concerns that Nicolás Maduro's regime will intensify repression following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in Venezuela. Machado, who is in hiding, noted that the regime has already arrested numerous opposition activists. She views the partial revocation of Chevron's license as a positive step, as it limits resources for the regime. Machado believes the Maduro regime is increasingly isolated internationally and faces an unsustainable economic crisis, with projections indicating further economic contraction. She also highlighted the low voter turnout in recent legislative elections as evidence of Maduro's weakening support.</p>

A government review is underway to address the financial challenges in higher education. Universities UK found institutions hesitant to collaborate due to concerns about violating competition laws. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) acknowledged the financial problems and aims to support collaboration where possible. Some universities are already collaborating to benefit students, but more clarity is needed to prevent isolated decisions about course closures. </p>

A new report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation.

One mother shared her struggles with finding suitable accommodation and the impact on her children's school attendance.

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, sparking controversy and drawing criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. The government asserts that compensation will be paid in most cases and that the law aims to increase black ownership of land. The new Expropriation Act allows for expropriation without compensation in rare circumstances, primarily for land reform purposes. The move is intended to address historical inequalities in land ownership, but critics argue it threatens property rights. The government hopes the law will expedite land acquisition and reduce costs associated with land restitution.</p>
