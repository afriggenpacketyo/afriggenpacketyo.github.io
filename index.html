        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity contracted in May, marking its worst drop since September 2022, primarily due to declining new export orders. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating contraction for the first time since September of the previous year. This decline was attributed to increased uncertainty in the external trade environment and domestic economic headwinds, with the job market also experiencing a grim period as employment shrank. Factories' finished goods inventory accumulated due to falling sales and outbound shipment delays, signaling a weakening in major macroeconomic indicators at the start of the second quarter. </p>

          <p>Sources report that the acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, causing confusion among staff. While a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, current and former employees expressed concern, citing low morale within the agency. The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1 and lasts through November, with NOAA predicting an above-average season with 13 to 19 named storms. The acting director is sticking with the old plan, and will not get in the way of the FEMA advisory council established by President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. </p>

          <p>Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, former Taiwanese defense official, cautioned about the increasing risk of a cross-strait military accident due to heightened pressure from Beijing and the absence of direct communication channels. Yang expressed concern over China's increasing "grey zone operations," including frequent activities by its coastguard near Taiwan, which are difficult to manage as they carry a military message without being actual military operations. He highlighted the immense pressure these activities place on Taiwan and voiced concerns about the lack of official communication between Beijing and Taipei since 2016. Exchanges were suspended after the previous Taiwanese leader refused to accept the one-China principle, and formal talks remain halted under the current leader. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes Donald Trump's response to a court ruling against his global trade tariffs, arguing that Trump prioritizes loyalty above all else. The author contends that Trump views any inconvenient court ruling as evidence of a rigged system against him, exemplified by his attacks on Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society after a court decision involving tariffs. The author suggests that Trump's demand for servile loyalty extends beyond the executive branch, influencing law firms, universities, and media outlets. This ethos undermines the principles of the Federalist Society, which has historically championed the Constitution in American law. </p>

The White House plans an "all-out advocacy effort," involving top administration officials pressuring senators through direct contact and potential state visits. Key sticking points include concerns over the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, with Trump assuring that only waste, fraud, and abuse would be targeted. With a narrow majority in both the House and Senate, Republicans are using reconciliation to pass the bill with a simple majority, necessitating adherence to the Byrd rule, which requires legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction. </p>

The bill is currently in the Senate after passing in the House, and Trump is urging Republicans to pass it before July 4, while Democrats are criticizing the bill, arguing that there will be cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. </p>

          <p>Four men from Los Angeles County have been arrested for allegedly running a drug trafficking operation and conspiring to distribute over 2,000 pounds of drugs and hundreds of thousands of counterfeit pills. Federal agents seized large quantities of methamphetamine, cocaine, powdered fentanyl, and counterfeit fentanyl pills from a safe house in Compton. Authorities also confiscated 13 firearms and seven vehicles, estimating the men made about $1.6 million in drug proceeds since 2023.
