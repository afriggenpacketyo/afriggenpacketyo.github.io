          <p>Israel initiated a series of airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders, including the commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and several nuclear scientists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," aims to eliminate the Iranian threat, and warned residents to prepare for potential retaliation. The United States clarified it was not involved in the strikes but was informed beforehand, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region. Oil prices surged, and U.S. stock futures declined amid fears of a broader regional conflict, with Iran's Supreme Leader vowing to avenge the attacks. The strikes took place amidst ongoing U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, further complicating diplomatic efforts. The strikes hit multiple cities including Natanz, home to a key nuclear facility, and Khandab, where a heavy water nuclear reactor is located. </p>

          <p>John Reade, a senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, asserts that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. He argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade emphasizes that cryptocurrencies do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of them being "gold 2.0." His comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies grows, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. He wishes proponents of digital assets would stop marketing them as 'gold 2.0', when they very clearly have different characteristics. </p>

          <p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused a court order that would have required President Trump to return control of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to Governor Gavin Newsom. This emergency stay comes after a U.S. District Judge ruled that Trump illegally mobilized the Guard amid protests over immigration raids. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for the case, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend. The Trump administration filed a notice of appeal, arguing the military mobilization is legal under Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Forces. </p>

          <p>Capitol Hill is experiencing heightened tensions following the detention of Senator Alex Padilla during a press conference and the indictment of Representative LaMonica McIver for assaulting federal agents. House Speaker Mike Johnson faced heckling from Democrats while discussing budget cuts, as they protested Padilla's treatment. Republicans criticized Padilla for attending protests instead of fulfilling his Senate duties. Lawmakers from both parties expressed concern over the incidents, fearing a potential erosion of trust and congressional decorum, with some suggesting the President needs to de-escalate the situation.

          <p>A federal appeals court has delayed an order that would have blocked the Trump administration from continuing to deploy the National Guard in California, setting a hearing for June 17. The lower court had previously issued a temporary restraining order, arguing that Trump's deployment of troops during protests over immigration raids was unlawful. Governor Gavin Newsom expressed gratification with the initial ruling, stating he would redeploy the National Guard to previous duties. The Trump administration argued the order was an unprecedented intrusion on the President’s authority as Commander in Chief. The judge said that the protests in Los Angeles fall far short of the legal requirements of a "rebellion" to justify a federal deployment. </p>

The average age of all mothers increased from 28.7 years old in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, with first-time mothers averaging 27.5 years old. Experts attribute this shift to changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023. Economic factors and social media may contribute to this decline. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, characterized as a "preemptive" strike by the Israeli government, but which seems more like a preventive war. The article questions whether this action fits the definition of preemption, which typically involves thwarting an imminent attack, or prevention, which involves removing a potential future threat. The author notes that preventive attacks are generally viewed as illegal and immoral, citing historical examples. While acknowledging the potential justification for Israel's actions given Iran's history and expressed genocidal intent, the article emphasizes the immense dangers and lack of finality in war. The piece also suggests that the scope of the Israeli offensive, including the reported deaths of senior Iranian leaders, raises questions about whether the goal is regime change. </p>

          <p>North Korea announced the successful repair and relaunch of a 5,000-ton destroyer that was damaged during a failed launch attempt last month. Leader Kim Jong Un attended the ceremony, revealing plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. The vessel tipped over at the Chongjin Shipyard in May, but Kim ordered it to be repaired before a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. The newly launched warship is scheduled to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026. </p>

          <p>The United States has publicly distanced itself from the Israeli military strikes in Iran, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that the U.S. was not involved and prioritizing the protection of American forces in the region. Rubio warned Iran not to retaliate against U.S. interests or personnel. Israeli officials reportedly notified the U.S. before beginning the strikes, which targeted Iran's nuclear program and other military sites. President Trump had previously warned that a military operation against Iran would "blow" negotiations to curb its nuclear program. The State Department had limited the movement of its employees within Israel to the Tel Aviv area. </p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing the forcible removal of Senator Alex Padilla by Secret Service and FBI officers at a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Padilla was grabbed, shoved, pushed to the ground, and handcuffed after he showed up and asked a question about the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Democrats are calling the incident "violent," "horrifying," and "a stunning abuse of power." The incident has heightened tensions between Democrats and the Trump administration over the use of the National Guard and Marines to quell protests against the administration’s anti-immigration program in Los Angeles. </p>

          <p>Dan Wang, an astute observer of contemporary China, describes the country as the “engineering state” due to its emphasis on building and innovation in various engineering fields. China's integrated transport system, including subway trains and high-speed rail, seems like the stuff of science fiction. The nation's STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one, with most of the nation’s top officials being engineers. Wang contrasts this with the United States, which he calls the “lawyerly state,” highlighting the difference in priorities and expertise between the two nations. </p>

The embassy urged Chinese citizens in Israel to closely monitor the evolving situation, remain calm, and stay vigilant, advising them to prepare for potential attacks involving missiles, rockets, drones, or other threats. Similarly, the Chinese embassy in Tehran called Iran’s latest security situation “severe and complicated,” warning its citizens and businesses to monitor the situation and take precautions. A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Iran’s retaliation was being discussed at the highest level, and that Tehran was planning to give a “harsh and decisive” response. </p>
