        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported disappointing first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue plummeting 20% year-over-year. The company cited production line updates for the Model Y, lower average selling prices, and sales incentives as factors contributing to the decline. Net income also saw a significant drop. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's administration, particularly the Department of Government Efficiency, has raised investor concerns about his focus on Tesla. Uncertainty surrounding evolving trade policies and geopolitical tensions further clouds Tesla's outlook, as the company faces increased competition and widespread protests. Optimism is tempered by the company's commitment to launching a driverless ride-hailing service and humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8%, citing the negative impact of tariffs and weakening consumer confidence.

The IMF's chief economist noted the rising probability of a U.S. recession, increasing from 25% to 40%, while also noting that the dollar may depreciate in real terms if tariffs translate into lower productivity in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Other conservatives remain opposed to any tax hikes, advocating for making Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent.

          <p>The executive producer of CBS's '60 Minutes' resigned, alleging that corporate leaders compromised the show's independence. Bill Owens's departure follows months of tension related to a lawsuit filed by President Trump over an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The lawsuit alleges election interference by CBS, and the network's parent company is currently seeking regulatory approval for a sale to a billionaire friend of Trump. Owens reportedly refused to apologize to Trump, and his departure has sparked concern about the show's future.</p>

Experts warn that garnishing wages will reduce consumer spending and potentially contribute to an economic slowdown. The resumption of collections ends a pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the policy may add to government revenue, it could also damage borrowers' credit scores and make it more difficult to obtain loans. (not investment advice)</p>
