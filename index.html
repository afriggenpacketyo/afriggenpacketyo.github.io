          <p>A U.S. airstrike in Yemen has reportedly killed at least 68 people at a migrant detention center in Saada Governorate, according to the Yemen Civil Defense. The center housed around 100 African migrants, and dozens more were injured in the strike. The U.S. military's Central Command stated that its campaign against Houthi forces has struck over 800 targets since March 15. The strikes are part of an intensified effort to degrade the Houthis' ability to attack commercial and military shipping in the region, following their attacks in response to the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The children's commissioner for England is urging the government to ban artificial intelligence (AI) apps that create sexually explicit images of children. Dame Rachel de Souza emphasizes the need for a total ban on "nudification" apps, which use AI to edit photos of real people to make them appear naked. She argues that the government is not adequately addressing the real-world consequences of such apps, which disproportionately target girls and young women. The government has announced plans to make it illegal to possess, create, or distribute AI tools designed to generate child sexual abuse material.</p>

          <p>Support from Hispanic voters, which helped Donald Trump win the White House, has decreased since he took office, with concerns about the economy and immigration policies contributing to the decline. A recent poll indicates that Trump's approval rating among Latinos has fallen, while his disapproval rating has increased. Some Hispanic voters express reservations about the deportations of people without judicial review. The shift in support highlights potential challenges for Trump in maintaining his coalition of supporters.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is reportedly planning to take on a significant role as a Republican political megadonor in the upcoming midterm elections after reducing his involvement in the Trump administration. Musk intends to use his wealth and social media platform X to influence political outcomes. Public disapproval of Musk has surged recently, particularly due to his involvement in cost-cutting measures and controversial political stances. His time in the White House has been marked by both substantial transformations and persistent questions about conflicts of interest.</p>
