          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 23:54:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his 2020 testimony to Congress, where he allegedly lied about authorizing an anonymous source regarding the Hillary Clinton email investigation. This indictment follows public pressure from President Donald Trump and comes days after a new interim U.S. Attorney, appointed by Trump, took office. Comey denies the charges, asserting his innocence and confidence in the judicial system.</p>

          <h2>Comey Indictment Raises Concerns Over Political Retribution in Justice Department</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 23:26:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is seen by many as an escalation of President Trump's promise of political retribution against critics. Critics argue that Attorney General Pam Bondi is weaponizing the Justice Department, particularly after a US Attorney who hesitated to prosecute Comey was replaced by a Trump loyalist with no prior federal prosecutorial experience. Legal experts describe the firewall between the DOJ and the White House as having "completely collapsed," raising serious concerns about the impartiality of the justice system. The case is poised to reignite debates over the 2016 Russia investigation and the integrity of federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on imported branded or patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1st, unless companies establish manufacturing plants within the U.S. This measure exempts firms that have already begun construction on domestic facilities. The move is part of Trump's broader economic strategy to boost U.S. manufacturing and follows a national security investigation into pharmaceutical imports. The pharmaceutical industry has voiced concerns that these tariffs could significantly increase costs, deter investment, and disrupt drug supply chains, potentially jeopardizing patient access and affordability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is drawing criticism for its extreme brevity and lack of specific details regarding the alleged false statements and obstruction. Legal analysts suggest the two-page document, which offers no explanation or supporting evidence for its claims, falls far below the typical standard for high-profile federal indictments. This vagueness fuels concerns that the prosecution is politically motivated, serving as an "authoritarian overreach" by President Trump to target a prominent critic. The absence of substantive allegations makes it difficult to evaluate the government's case, leading to widespread dismay within the Justice Department.</p>

          <h2>Trump Imposes 25% Tariff on Imported Heavy Trucks Starting October 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 23:07:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks, effective October 1st, as part of his administration's "America First" manufacturing agenda. The measure aims to protect U.S. manufacturers like Peterbilt and Mack Trucks from foreign competition and addresses national security concerns. This new duty is one of several tariffs recently unveiled by Trump, including those on pharmaceuticals and kitchen cabinets.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he is prepared to leave office once Russia's war on Ukraine concludes, emphasizing that his primary goal is to achieve peace rather than secure another term. In an interview, he affirmed his willingness to hold elections in Ukraine during a potential ceasefire period. These remarks come as Ukraine remains under martial law, which currently prohibits elections. Zelenskyy, whose five-year term would have ended in May 2024, has been in office for over six years due to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Blaine Milam, a Texas man, was executed for the 2008 murder of his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, during a torturous ordeal described by the couple as an "exorcism." Milam, 35, was pronounced dead after receiving a lethal injection, marking the fifth execution in Texas this year. Prosecutors detailed a savage beating over 30 hours, resulting in numerous fatal injuries, though Milam blamed his girlfriend. His final appeals, citing discredited bite mark evidence and intellectual disability claims, were rejected by the Supreme Court. This execution underscores the brutality of the crime and ongoing debates about forensic evidence in capital cases.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, currently in the central Atlantic, is expected to strengthen and could potentially interact with another developing storm system near the northeastern Caribbean. This interaction might lead to a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two tropical storms merge or orbit a common center. While forecasters predict Humberto will not make landfall, a collision, though unlikely to be a full "dance" due to strength disparity, could slightly alter their projected paths. The second system is also anticipated to strengthen and track towards the Bahamas, increasing risks for the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home and are recovering at the New York Aquarium. Trading in coral is highly restricted due to their protected status under international conservation agreements. The aquarium, acting as a "coral hospital," rehabilitated the corals which were in poor health after five days in transit. Many have since recovered sufficiently to be moved to public display, serving as ambassadors for their species and educating visitors on the importance of marine conservation.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress have dismissed the White House's threat of mass federal workforce layoffs ahead of a potential government shutdown as an "intimidation tactic." House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the administration of trying to scare federal workers and leverage the funding dispute. Democrats are standing firm on their demands for health care priorities in exchange for funding, declaring the House-passed Republican funding measure "dead on arrival" in the Senate. They argue that if a shutdown occurs, it will be due to Republican unwillingness to negotiate a bipartisan agreement.</p>

          <p>The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs, known as reduction-in-force notices, in the event of a government shutdown next week.

While essential services like Social Security and military operations would continue, the memo significantly raises the stakes in the ongoing funding dispute with Congress.

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel is causing alarm in a California town, attacking several residents and sending at least two to the emergency room with bites and scratches. The attacks in San Rafael's Lucas Valley neighborhood have prompted warnings to residents, with one victim describing being "body slammed" by the animal. Experts from Marin Humane suggest that such rare aggression typically stems from humans hand-feeding or hand-raising wildlife, causing animals to lose their natural fear and become aggressive when not fed. This incident serves as a reminder against interacting with wild animals for public safety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is exploring diverse options for its Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS), including converting business jets into aerial refueling tankers. This initiative aims to address evolving anti-air threats and the need for greater flexibility in contested environments, potentially allowing for operations from shorter runways with reduced logistical demands. While business jet-based tankers would have less fuel capacity than current models, they could support routine missions and free up larger tankers for more demanding operations. The Air Force is also refining cost estimates for stealthy tanker designs, emphasizing survivability in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer observes a stark division in the current economy, with a robust artificial intelligence sector contrasting sharply with a weaker consumer-oriented segment. He argues that while AI giants like CoreWeave and Meta are making multi-billion dollar investments, consumer-facing companies in autos, housing, and retail are struggling, leading to job cuts. Cramer suggests that the overall strong GDP growth is heavily skewed by the tech sector, masking underlying weaknesses elsewhere. He contends that interest rate cuts are necessary to boost the struggling consumer economy, despite elevated prices and strong overall GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated Shouhed impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting a federal officer.

          <p>Urban rat populations are experiencing a "remarkable" increase globally, with significant surges reported in cities like Washington D.C., San Francisco, and New York. Pest control experts and urban rodentologists attribute this rise partly to warming temperatures, especially milder winters, which enhance rat breeding rates as they don't hibernate. Other contributing factors include growing fast-food consumption, less frequent rubbish collection, and urban development reducing natural habitats. Rats pose public health risks by spreading diseases and contaminating food. Solutions involve cutting off food sources, improving waste management, and public awareness campaigns, highlighting a growing challenge for city environments.</p>
