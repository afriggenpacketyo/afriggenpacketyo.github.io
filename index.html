          <p>Alibaba founder Jack Ma made a surprise appearance at the company's annual AliDay event in Hangzhou, visiting a replica of the flat where Alibaba was founded, which boosted employee morale amid strategic repositioning at the company. Ma's visit, during which he toured the campus and attended a music show, generated excitement among employees, who see him as the company's spiritual leader and largest shareholder. The replica flat displayed a quote from Deng Xiaoping, and employees paid homage, reflecting on the company's entrepreneurial beginnings and reigniting memories of Alibaba's early days and its rapid growth. The event was held to honor family members for their support of employees across various Alibaba offices.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for critical trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war, which has seen tariffs soar to 145% on Chinese imports and 125% on U.S. goods. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, mark the first high-level discussions since the tariff escalation, with hopes of easing tensions and reassuring global markets, but expectations for a significant tariff reduction remain low. President Trump has hinted at potentially lowering tariffs to 80%, but China insists on equal footing and mutual respect in negotiations, and economists warn of continued economic strain if the trade war persists. The talks are closely watched by businesses and investors, concerned about the impact of tariffs on global growth and consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Indian officials have accused Pakistan of moving troops into forward areas, indicating a potential escalation of the ongoing conflict between the two nations, following recent cross-border fire and strikes. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistan's actions constituted provocations, while Indian Army Col. Sofiya Qureshi suggested the troop movements indicated offensive intent, though Indian armed forces remain in a high state of readiness. Indian Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh refuted Pakistani claims of damaging Indian military infrastructure, dismissing them as misinformation. Tensions have risen since the April 22 attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India attributed to Pakistani-backed militants, leading to retaliatory strikes by both sides.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer prominent in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next U.S. Surgeon General, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Means, a former surgeon turned metabolic health advocate, will work alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to address chronic diseases and improve American health. She co-founded Levels, an app for tracking food and biometric data, and co-authored "Good Energy," a book examining American health issues. Means' views align with Kennedy's, focusing on improving the food supply and expressing vaccine skepticism, although there is no evidence to suggest that childhood vaccines or the current CDC vaccine schedule are unsafe.</p>

          <p>With President Trump vowing to pull back U.S. support for Ukraine, European leaders are struggling to fill the gap in military aid, as European industry executives predict it will take a decade to get assembly lines up to speed. Ukraine's Parliament approved a deal to give the United States a share of future revenue over natural resources in hopes of securing continued American assistance, as Ukrainian forces face shortages of long-range missiles and artillery. While European leaders are willing to invest in weapons production, their industrial capacity is insufficient to meet Ukraine's immediate needs, and allies fear that Mr. Trump will pull Russian deterrents, like U.S. troops and the American nuclear umbrella, out of Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, in response to recent judicial challenges to immigration detentions. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller argued that the Constitution allows for suspension during times of rebellion or invasion, while describing habeas corpus as a "privilege." Legal experts and critics have questioned this interpretation of US law, asserting that Congress, not the president, holds the authority to suspend habeas corpus. The administration's discussions follow several court cases challenging the deportation of undocumented migrants, including the release of students detained over their political views.</p>

          <p>Allegations have surfaced that Rinaldo Nazzaro, a former Pentagon contractor and leader of the neo-Nazi group The Base, may be a Russian spy co-opting US far-right groups to attack western democracies. The Guardian revealed allegations from inside the Base that Nazzaro was long suspected of working with the FSB, one of Russiaâ€™s main intelligence services. Experts suggest this fits a pattern of the Kremlin using hybrid warfare tactics to undermine enemies, including using disinformation and providing paramilitary training to extremists. Nazzaro denies the claims, but suspicions persist due to his relocation to Russia, marriage to a Russian citizen, and alleged financial transactions.</p>

Customers can only order this item in person, and while some are intrigued by the flavor combination, others express skepticism or disappointment. Some commenters compare the taste to cream soda rather than cotton candy, and some express doubt about the chain's ability to fulfill the order, citing the chain's infamously broken milkshake machines. This isn't the first time a secret menu item at McDonald's has sparked a viral conversation, as the "Land, Air & Sea" sandwich gained traction in 2022.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 100% tariffs on foreign-produced films are causing concern in the global film industry, as studios face potential cost increases and production disruptions. The tariffs, part of Trump's "Liberation Day" package, have already affected funding for some productions, and Serbian make-up artist Jovana Vukosavljevic fears it will worsen an already challenging situation. A major French production company lost funding from a Chinese partner for an American project after the sweeping tariff announcement on April 2, a source at the company told the Post. The move threatens to disrupt international collaborations and shift the landscape of film production.</p>

          <p>Former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone criticizes Major League Baseball's emphasis on analytics and velocity over craft, arguing that it leads to increased injuries and boring baseball. Mazzone, who oversaw one of baseball's greatest pitching staffs, believes the focus on "grunt and heave" and arcane metrics like spin rates is detrimental to pitchers' health and the quality of the game. He advocates for a return to varying speeds, location, and controlling effort, and despite a recent MLB report acknowledging the issues, the emphasis on velocity remains entrenched throughout the sport. Mazzone is not opposed to computer analysis as a tool in a coachâ€™s arsenal, but his pitching credo had little to do with 100-miles-an-hour fastballs and the obsessive monitoring of pitch counts and spin rates.</p>

The tariffs, intended to boost manufacturing jobs, have resulted in fewer cargo containers moving through the ports, threatening jobs for longshoremen and truckers and potentially raising consumer prices. Port officials predict a 35% plunge in activity, equivalent to 225,000 fewer TEUs in May alone, and representatives warn of significant job losses in the harbor communities.

          <p>Republican lawmakers are introducing a surge of state-level bills targeting transgender individuals, focusing on issues such as bathroom access, medical care, and sports participation, which puts Democrats in a difficult political position. While most bills do not pass, the high volume forces votes and drives divisive debates, and some states have already enacted restrictive measures. Democrats are reevaluating their response to the issue, with some acknowledging public sentiment while others protest the legislation, and the ACLU and Trans Legislation Tracker report record numbers of anti-LGBTQ bills being filed, though figures are debated. The political potency of the issue is being leveraged by Republicans, who see it as effective for campaign ads and mailers, while advocates for transgender rights seek new strategies to humanize transgender individuals and combat misinformation.</p>

          <p>Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro has been appointed as the acting U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., becoming the 23rd Fox personality to join the Trump administration. Trump cited Pirro's work on Fox News as a qualification, and this appointment continues the trend of Fox News personalities transitioning into high-ranking positions within the administration. Pirro, a former county judge and district attorney, has a long-standing friendship with Trump and has been a vocal supporter of his policies, though she has faced controversy and suspension from Fox News for her remarks. Pirro succeeds Ed Martin, whose Senate confirmation faced opposition, and she will now lead the office prosecuting cases related to the January 6th Capitol riot.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging "The Central Park Five," an opera by Anthony Davis that won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2020, focusing on the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of five Black and brown teenagers in 1989. The opera also includes Donald Trump, who in 1989, took out full-page newspaper ads demanding the death penalty for the teenagers, and the opera presents the aria in a less incendiary manner, focusing on the lives of the wrongly accused men. Director Nataki Garrett emphasizes that the opera is about the lives and journeys of these men, and how they have positively impacted their communities, at a moment when stories about race and power are being politicized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economist Brad Setser raises concerns about China's altered trade surplus reporting, suggesting it conceals billions in unreported income and capital outflows. Setser claims China's manufacturing surplus rose by about 1% of global GDP, or $1 trillion, so with this, half of it being suppressed suggests a gap of $500 billion in hidden trade surplus. China now calculates its current account using an internal payments dataset that is not transparent, which may be an attempt to avoid scrutiny or hide capital flight. The shift has drawn criticism, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accusing China of creating persistent trade imbalances, contributing to global dependence on U.S. demand to spur growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Maintaining friendships can be challenging after having children, but communication and compassion are key to preserving these relationships, regardless of whether friends have kids or not. Common challenges include assumptions about availability, exclusion from conversations, and inflexibility regarding activities. Open communication and flexibility are essential, such as extending invitations to family-focused events or engaging in everyday activities together. Addressing difficult conversations directly can strengthen bonds, while recognizing that friendships may evolve naturally over time, as it's ok to recognize we're not the same people we used to be.</p>
