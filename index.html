          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court was arrested on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement. Federal authorities allege she intentionally misdirected agents away from an undocumented immigrant she was pursuing, directing him through a side door in her courtroom. Dugan, known for her progressive stances, was elected in 2016, defeating a Republican incumbent. She has spent her career advocating for marginalized groups and previously dismissed a lawsuit against a get-out-the-vote effort in Milwaukee.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. has accused Conor Benn and his team of attempting to sabotage his weight cut, resulting in a £375,000 fine for being slightly over the middleweight limit.

          <p>Lawyers representing Venezuelan men facing deportation argue that the Trump administration is violating due process rights by failing to provide adequate notice as mandated by the Supreme Court's ruling on the Alien Enemies Act. The attorneys claim that notices were given in English to Spanish speakers and lacked information on how to contest the deportation. Legal experts expect these cases to continue moving through the court system, potentially returning to the Supreme Court to further define due process requirements in deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar index is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era, declining about 9% since Donald Trump's return to the White House. This decline is attributed to Trump's tariff policies, which have led investors to seek assets outside the U.S., weakening the dollar. Analysts suggest this shift indicates a structural change in global asset allocation trends away from the U.S. dollar, compounded by concerns over potential recession and the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>

Trump's approval rating is at 42 percent, historically low for this point in a presidency, but consistent with his past unpopularity.</p>

          <p>Yale University came under scrutiny for hosting Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for a talk organized by a student organization. Ben-Gvir, known for his extremist views and past convictions for inciting racism and supporting terrorism, has been criticized for advocating policies that deliberately starve civilians. The event has sparked debate about who is allowed to speak and what facts are reported, particularly in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
