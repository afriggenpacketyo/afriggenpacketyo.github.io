          <p>President Trump claimed that former FBI Director James Comey's Instagram post, featuring the numbers "8647," was a veiled call for his assassination. Trump asserted that Comey, as a former FBI director, would have understood the violent connotations associated with the numbers. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service initiated an investigation into the post, which Comey later deleted, claiming he was unaware of the numbers' violent association and had simply intended a political message. Trump insisted that the post was a clear incitement to violence, echoing similar claims made by other administration officials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz detailed the arduous four-year journey and over $25 million spent to list his crypto firm, Galaxy Digital, on the Nasdaq, calling the experience "unfair, infuriating". He noted the extensive regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, requiring nine rounds of comments, and significantly higher auditing costs compared to traditional financial firms. Novogratz believes the regulatory environment has forced crypto firms to be well capitalized. Galaxy Digital's listing is one of the first major fintech IPOs since 2021, signaling renewed investor interest in crypto-adjacent companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament debated and approved changes to a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance in ending their lives. One approved amendment ensures that no staff member, including social care workers and pharmacists, would be forced to participate in the assisted dying process against their wishes. The debate was emotionally charged, with supporters arguing the bill had been strengthened by previous changes, while opponents expressed concerns about potential coercion and the need for stronger protections for vulnerable individuals. Further debate and voting on additional amendments are scheduled for June 13, followed by a vote on the bill's overall passage.</p>

          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was murdered in her Minneapolis apartment, leaving behind a bloody crime scene and a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints. Investigators initially suspected Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but his alibi and footprint analysis cleared him. Decades later, in 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that led investigators to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom denied knowing Childs or being at the apartment, but his DNA and footprint matched the crime scene evidence, leading to his arrest for the murder of Childs.

          <p>NJ Transit rail service has been fully shut down due to a strike by rail engineers that began at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The strike is impacting over 300,000 daily commuters, and NJ Transit is advising people to work from home if possible. The agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) are at odds over pay raises, with the union claiming they haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service on 19 routes, but it can only handle about 20% of daily train riders.</p>

          <p>Former FBI director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting and then deleting a social media post that Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against President Trump. Comey's Instagram post featured seashells spelling the numbers "8647", which some interpreted as a call for Trump's assassination. Comey claimed he was unaware of the numbers' violent association, but Trump disputed this, stating that "a child knows what that meant." The Secret Service is taking the rhetoric seriously and investigating the matter.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced that CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen is stepping down as the Wegovy maker faces increasing competition in the obesity drug market. The decision comes as Novo Nordisk's stock price has declined significantly over the past year due to increased competition and disappointing trial results. The company said Jørgensen will remain in his post to support a smooth transition to new leadership. Former Novo CEO Lars Rebien Sørensen will join Novo Nordisk's board, initially as an observer.

          <p>Matthew Piercey, a 48-year-old Palo Cedro man, pleaded guilty in federal court to charges stemming from a $35 million investment fraud scheme. Piercey ran a Ponzi scheme between July 2015 and August 2020, making false statements to investors about his companies' financial stability. When he found out he was under investigation, he tried to discourage subpoenaed investors and witnesses from responding to the grand jury. When law enforcement came to arrest him, Piercey led them on a vehicle chase ending with a failed underwater escape attempt in Lake Shasta. (not investment advice)</p>
