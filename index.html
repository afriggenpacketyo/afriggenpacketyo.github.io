          <p>This New York Times article reports that the United States' loss of its last triple-A credit rating by Moody's, combined with concerns about government debt, is threatening financial markets. The downgrade was influenced by a bill in Congress to make President Trump's tax cuts permanent, which could increase federal debt. Analysts suggest the downgrade could exacerbate existing concerns about Trump's tariff agenda and its impact on the American economy. The article highlights the potential for further market disruption if the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds is shaken.</p>
