          <p>Adam Scott discusses his journey from a character actor to the Emmy-nominated lead of the hit Apple TV+ series "Severance." He reflects on the terror and vindication of headlining a major show after a 30-year career, which included well-known roles in "Parks and Recreation" and "Step Brothers." Director Ben Stiller praises Scott's technical skill in playing the dual-personality role, a key element to the show's success. Scott explains that he drew upon all his experience for the demanding part, which he feels he was uniquely suited to portray.</p>

Her declaration comes as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's alleged direct action tactics and a manual providing guidance on how to attack targets and evade law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The recent investigations and expulsions of several senior officials from ethnic minority communities in China signal a significant policy shift within the Communist Party's anti-corruption drive. High-ranking cadres from Tibetan and Hui backgrounds, who traditionally held top regional government posts, are now facing scrutiny, suggesting that ethnicity-based leniency in elite politics is ending. Observers note that these actions reflect a broader push for stringent political discipline that applies universally across the party, regardless of an official's ethnic background. This marks a departure from past practices aimed at promoting ethnic inclusion in regional governance.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, a man known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, has been sentenced to death for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in Phoenix during the early 1990s. The cold case was solved decades later using DNA and genetic genealogy, which led investigators to Miller after an elaborate undercover sting operation. His defense team argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming childhood abuse led to dissociative amnesia and the creation of a violent alter ego. The judge ultimately found him guilty of the brutal crimes.</p>

          <p>Colorado dentist James Craig has been charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig, who died in March 2023 after being poisoned with cyanide and arsenic. Investigators allege Craig administered the poison through his wife's routine morning protein shakes, following online research into undetectable poisons. The investigation was triggered when a staff member at Craig's dental practice intercepted a package containing potassium cyanide. Prosecutors suggest motives including a multi-million dollar life insurance policy and an affair with an orthodontist he met shortly before his wife's illness began.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia's rejection of a ceasefire is complicating peace efforts, as he prepares to meet with President Trump and European leaders at the White House. The statement follows a summit in Alaska where President Putin reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region for an end to the war, a condition Kyiv rejects. Zelenskyy emphasized that stopping the violence is a crucial first step and that Russia's unwillingness to do so signals a lack of commitment to a peaceful resolution. European leaders are set to join the White House talks to discuss security guarantees and continued support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has weakened to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and wind to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the storm is forecast to turn north and avoid a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland. However, the National Hurricane Center warns that Erin is growing in size, which will generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along much of the Eastern U.S. coastline this week. The storm's path is being influenced by a weakening Bermuda High and an approaching cold front.</p>

This move by coach Ruben Amorim follows Hojlund being left on the bench during a recent pre-season friendly, signaling that a transfer, with AC Milan among the interested clubs, could be imminent.</p>

          <p>The recent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, concluded without a ceasefire, effectively strengthening Putin's strategic position, according to this analysis. Putin successfully reframed the talks, making a comprehensive peace deal that addresses Russia's territorial claims a prerequisite for any halt in fighting, a stance Trump appeared to accept. By engaging in bilateral talks and securing Trump's focus on a grand deal, Putin has potentially neutralized the immediate threat of further U.S. sanctions and deepened mistrust between Washington and its European allies. The outcome leaves Ukraine facing continued Russian aggression with diminished U.S. military support.</p>

          <p>China has lodged a formal complaint with Japan after several Japanese cabinet members paid respects at the Yasukuni Shrine on the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender. The shrine honors convicted war criminals among others, and visits by officials are viewed by China and other neighbors as a sign of militaristic revisionism. While Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering instead of visiting, the presence of other ministers was called a "blatant provocation" by Beijing. China's foreign ministry urged Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and sever ties with militarism.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations took place across Israel, with a major protest in Tel Aviv calling for an immediate hostage release deal and an end to the war in Gaza. Protesters blocked major roads and unfurled a large flag with portraits of the remaining captives, as a general strike was called by organizers. The demonstrations reflect growing public pressure on the government, with many fearing that continued military operations could further endanger the hostages. The protests come as Israel's security cabinet approved plans to seize Gaza City, continuing the long-running offensive against Hamas.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic-era fort off the Pembrokeshire coast, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party space and is now on the market for £3 million. Purchaser Mike Conner bought the abandoned, off-grid property in 2017 for £555,000 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable. The historic 100-man fort, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. The challenging renovation required workers to live on-site and materials to be brought in by helicopter.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key mental tool during her 13-month recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by veteran teammate Dearica Hamby, helped the former Stanford star maintain a positive outlook and visualize her goals, from on-court success to personal milestones. Brink believes this focus on manifestation and intentionality allowed her to patiently navigate the grueling rehabilitation process. Since her return to the court, the WNBA sophomore has made an immediate impact, a testament to her mental preparation and focus.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, leaving approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian nationals, including critics of the Kremlin, in limbo. Many of these individuals, who fled persecution for their opposition to the war in Ukraine, had already received preliminary approval from the German Foreign Office before the Interior Ministry halted the process. The suspension is part of a broader review of migration policy by the new coalition government. Advocacy groups warn that these dissidents are at risk of extradition or abduction if they remain in former Soviet countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is at odds over how to expand the Bundeswehr to meet NATO personnel targets, with a key debate centered on compulsory military service. The Social Democrats (SPD), led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, favor an enhanced voluntary service model, while their partners in the CDU/CSU coalition believe compulsion may be necessary to ensure national security. A new draft law would require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve and undergo a medical exam. However, critics argue this falls short of what is needed to address the growing threat from Russia.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced climber, was rappelling down a series of falls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into the cavern. After an extensive search involving aircraft and drones, rescuers located him alive and conscious. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully performed a hoist operation to lift him to safety, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the total annual cost of attendance at some U.S. universities approaches the $100,000 mark, nine institutions stand out by charging no tuition for any of their students. This small group includes all five U.S. military service academies, specialized schools like Webb Institute, and work colleges such as Berea College and College of the Ozarks. While these schools eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they are highly selective and often require a significant commitment in return. Students must typically participate in mandatory work programs or agree to serve in the military after graduation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its enforcement of the 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action by requiring universities to submit detailed admissions data. The Department of Education aims to identify and eliminate the use of "racial proxies" in admissions, with some advocating for a shift to class-based affirmative action as a legal alternative. Progressive policy expert Richard Kahlenberg, who testified against race-based preferences, argues that a class-based system creates both racial and economic diversity. However, there is concern that the administration may also challenge class-based programs if they result in increased minority enrollment.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of emotional "brotherhood meetings" during training camp to build chemistry among a team with many new players and coaches. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal stories and vulnerabilities, leading to what Foster described as "a lot of tears" and a stronger team bond. The initiative is part of an effort to instill a "We over me" mentality for the 2025 season. Players noted that the vulnerability shown by coaches encouraged them to open up and connect on a deeper level.</p>
