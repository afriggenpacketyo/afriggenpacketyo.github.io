          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and taking credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He criticized past political leaders for involving the military in nation-building efforts, emphasizing a shift towards focusing on crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. Trump also highlighted the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies and touted a new peacetime recruiting record, while CBS News noted that recruitment reforms under the previous administration likely contributed to the rise in enlistments. The address followed Vice President Vance's speech at the Naval Academy, underscoring a shift away from 'forever wars'.</p>

          <p>Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller, "It Was Just an Accident," won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant win for a director previously banned from leaving Iran.

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a WWI-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution team used advanced deep-sea imaging technology to survey the wreck, which was initially located in 1972. The expedition involved the use of Alvin and Sentry, allowing for detailed mapping and close-up video of the submarine. The team held a remembrance ceremony, ringing a bell 19 times to honor the lost crew members, emphasizing the Navy's commitment to remembering their legacies.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, facing scrutiny over his mental health and attendance record, says he feels unfairly shamed into fulfilling senatorial duties he considers 'performative'. In an interview, Fetterman explained that media outlets have 'weaponized' his absenteeism to portray him as mentally unfit, a consequence of his openness about his mental health struggles. He acknowledged missing votes to spend time with his family and expressed frustration over the structure of Senate hearings. Fetterman, who has embraced Mounjaro for weight loss and mental clarity, also noted his pro-Israel stance has given him a sense of purpose, while some colleagues worry about his isolation.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on renewing the arms embargo on South Sudan, as Amnesty International warns that the conflict could worsen without it. The embargo, imposed in 2018, has faced violations, including the alleged deployment of armed Ugandan soldiers and military equipment to South Sudan. While the UN maintains its peacekeeping efforts through UNMISS, some citizens question the impact of these interventions. The ongoing instability has displaced millions and left thousands of children malnourished, highlighting the critical need for effective measures to prevent further escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a gay Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution. Judge Brian Murphy criticized the government for claiming O.C.G. did not fear being sent to Mexico, where he said he was sexually assaulted and held captive, and later admitting they could not identify the officials to whom he made that statement. The judge found that O.C.G. was likely to succeed in showing his removal lacked due process. The government has been ordered to investigate and report on how it claimed O.C.G. did not fear deportation.</p>
