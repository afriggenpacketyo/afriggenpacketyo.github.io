            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, dubbed the 'world's coolest dictator,' visited President Trump at the White House, marking the first official invitation to a Latin American leader since Trump took office. Bukele's strong anti-immigration stance and cooperation on deporting alleged gang members have solidified his relationship with the Trump administration. Despite criticism from human rights organizations regarding mass arrests and due process, Bukele's policies have significantly reduced homicides in El Salvador and garnered him high approval ratings. Discussions at the White House are expected to focus on migration, tariffs, and the potential detention of American criminals in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Stock markets in Asia and Europe experienced gains after the U.S. announced temporary tariff exemptions for key consumer electronics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led the surge, followed by increases in Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, and Sydney. However, President Trump cautioned that these exemptions were temporary and that new national security classifications would lead to specific tariffs on these goods in the future. This uncertainty continues to impact market sentiment as investors await further clarification on trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A report by MPs has concluded that police forces were often unprepared for the violence that erupted following the murder of three children in Southport.

            <p>Singapore's Monetary Authority eased its monetary policy for the second time, anticipating a potential zero-growth year following a lower-than-expected 3.8% GDP expansion in the first quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, citing declines in manufacturing and some service sectors. The slowdown is attributed to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, which are expected to negatively impact the growth outlook for both countries. The MAS will reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that sustainable investors should reconsider their approach to oil and gas companies, similar to how defense policies have been re-evaluated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. An analyst argues that the energy transition will be longer than expected and that oil and gas companies are significant investors in low-carbon energy. However, others disagree, citing the negative impacts of fossil fuels and the need for rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. (not investment advice)</p>

Bookings to Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia have risen significantly, while bookings to southern Europe have shifted to shoulder seasons. The trend reflects a conscious decision to avoid intense summer heat and wildfires, driven by the effects of climate change.</p>

            <p>Actress Aimee Lou Wood has criticized a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her, calling it 'mean and unfunny'.
