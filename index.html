          <p>Federal agents in Chicago arrested Juan Espinoza Martinez, a suspected Latin Kings leader, accused of offering cash bounties for the capture and killing of a senior immigration officer involved in "Operation Midway Blitz." The U.S. Attorney's Office unsealed a murder-for-hire complaint, highlighting the alleged plot as an attack on the rule of law and public safety. Martinez allegedly used Snapchat to offer $2,000 for information and $10,000 for the officer's takedown, including a photo of the target. This arrest follows a violent weekend in Chicago, marked by multiple shootings and clashes with law enforcement, underscoring ongoing gang violence concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week after the Senate repeatedly failed to pass rival funding bills. Republicans' proposal and Democrats' bill, which included healthcare subsidies, both fell short of the 60-vote threshold. President Trump hinted at openness to negotiating with Democrats on Affordable Care Act subsidies, a key Democratic demand, despite earlier White House refusal. The impasse has led to warnings of potential federal workforce layoffs and the cancellation of funding for various projects in Democratic-governed areas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion for U.S. farmers, particularly soybean growers heavily impacted by a Chinese boycott. Discussions involve the Treasury and Agriculture Departments, with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett promising "big measures" soon. The administration aims to address overflowing silos and lack of Chinese purchases, which totaled $12.6 billion in 2024. President Trump previously suggested using tariff revenue for farmer relief, emphasizing support until tariffs yield benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hollywood Burbank Airport's air traffic control tower became temporarily unmanned, leading to significant flight delays, attributed to staffing shortages amidst the ongoing government shutdown. The Federal Aviation Authority anticipates the tower will be unstaffed for several hours, with outgoing flights delayed by an average of over two and a half hours. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted an uptick in air traffic controllers calling in sick due to working without pay. Southern California TRACON is managing air traffic in the airport's airspace, but the situation highlights the shutdown's direct impact on critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of a "military-style invasion" in Chicago, alleging the use of Black Hawk helicopters and tactical agents in immigration raids, sparking fear. Pritzker filed a lawsuit to block federal deployment, stating Trump uses service members as political props. Meanwhile, President Trump indicated he might invoke the Insurrection Act if courts or local leaders impede federal operations, citing incidents of violence against immigration agents.

          <p>Renewable energy, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal to become the world's largest source of electricity in the first half of this year, a historic milestone according to Ember. Strong growth in solar and wind met all additional electricity demand, contributing to a slight reduction in fossil fuel use. While developing countries, particularly China and India, led this clean energy expansion, developed nations like the US and EU increased reliance on fossil fuels. Solar power, with dramatic cost reductions, drove most of the growth, especially in lower-income countries, despite some regional challenges like water table depletion in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon, Karin Immergut, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to the state. This ruling came after President Trump attempted to send California and Texas National Guard troops following an earlier block on Oregon's own Guard. Immergut questioned the federal government's attempt to circumvent her initial order, stating that the relatively small protests in Portland did not justify the use of federalized forces and risked state sovereignty. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to the administration's authority to deploy military forces without state consent.</p>

Work coaches describe being stretched thin with short appointment times, hindering personalized support for those with long-term health conditions.

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, noted that OpenAI's deals with AMD and Nvidia are announcements, not deployments, stressing that "the best chips will win." He highlighted that these partnerships underscore an intensifying competitive landscape and continued "compute scarcity" due to massive demand for AI services. This also reflects the heating AI arms race, with China's DeepSeek innovating with domestically made chips and raising U.S. national security concerns. OpenAI's President emphasized the industry's need to collaborate to meet the overwhelming demand for AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Avi Schiffmann, the 22-year-old CEO of Friend, a wearable AI companion, is embracing the widespread public backlash and vandalism against his New York City subway ad campaign. Schiffmann views the controversy as intentional, considering the graffiti and criticism as valuable PR, asserting that "the picture of the billboard is the billboard." He defends the AI pendant, which has seen limited sales, as a new category of companionship, likening it to a therapist or even a "god." Critics, however, point to the device's flaws and the broader societal concerns about AI companionship, while Schiffmann prioritizes "mindshare" to spark discussion about AI's role in human connection.</p>

          <p>Police have dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China in the last year, in what is described as the UK's largest operation against phone thefts. The investigation began when a victim traced a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow. Authorities arrested 18 suspects and recovered over 2,000 devices, primarily Apple products due to their high profitability overseas. The Metropolitan Police noted a tripling of phone thefts in London over four years, with criminals increasingly turning to this lucrative trade, selling devices in China for up to £4,000 each.</p>

          <p>Modelo owner Constellation Brands reported stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings but reiterated its lowered full-year guidance, citing macroeconomic headwinds. The company's net sales dropped 15% year-over-year, and operating margin declined partly due to aluminum tariffs. CEO Bill Newlands highlighted efforts in distribution and innovation amidst a challenging consumer demand environment. Constellation previously cut its full-year comparable earnings per share outlook and organic net sales forecast, also noting a trend of lower demand from Hispanic consumers due to concerns about President Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses.

          <p>Larry Ellison, a billionaire tech mogul and friend of President Trump, is poised to significantly expand his media influence as his family's empire potentially acquires CBS, Paramount, CNN, and TikTok. While maintaining a lower public profile than other tech billionaires, Ellison's involvement in such high-stakes acquisitions suggests a growing consolidation of media power. His close ties to the Trump administration add a political dimension to these potential deals, raising questions about the future landscape of media ownership and its implications for public information and political discourse.</p>

          <p>AppLovin shares plummeted after Bloomberg reported that the SEC is investigating the mobile advertising company over its data-collection practices. The probe, reportedly triggered by a whistleblower complaint and short-seller reports, examines whether the company violated agreements on targeted ads. Short-seller firms like Muddy Waters Research have accused AppLovin of "systematically" violating app store terms by impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs to funnel targeted ads without user consent. Despite a strong year for its stock, driven by AI ad-targeting technology, the investigation raises significant concerns about regulatory compliance and ethical data handling.
