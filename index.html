          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student and Fulbright scholar at Tufts University, was detained by ICE and transferred to Louisiana.  Her attorneys argue her detention violates her constitutional rights, citing her support for Palestinians as the reason for the visa revocation. Tufts University president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration supporting Ozturk's release, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. The Justice Department argues that the case should be heard in Louisiana where she is detained.</p>
