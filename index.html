          <p>Europe has established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States heading into the Ryder Cup singles matches, marking their largest ever pre-singles advantage. This article highlights the European team's imperious performance and the significant struggles faced by the American side, including leadership issues and the poor form of top players like Scottie Scheffler. The event was further complicated by controversial crowd behavior, with European players such as Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry reportedly subjected to personal insults. Despite the contentious atmosphere and American capitulation, Europe is now poised to retain the trophy, requiring only two and a half more points for a decisive victory.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced a historic flop at the Ryder Cup, losing his first three matches and becoming the first American to lose in all four opening sessions. Despite his recent dominance in stroke-play, the team format exposed vulnerabilities in his game, particularly his putting, which appeared fragile under pressure. This article details how Scheffler, typically known for managing his emotions, showed signs of unraveling, raising questions about his mindset in team events.

          <p>Devastating heavy rainfall in Arizona has resulted in at least four confirmed deaths, with three individuals found in Globe and another in suburban Phoenix. The rural community of Globe, one of Arizona's oldest mining towns, experienced severe inundation, leading to approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks being swept through the downtown area, creating a hazardous situation.

          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is being critically examined, with experts expressing skepticism despite anecdotal evidence. Collagen, a vital protein for skin integrity, naturally declines with age. This article explains that while companies now use smaller collagen peptides for better absorption, their direct impact on skin is uncertain, as they may support other organs. Dermatologists recommend marine collagen over bovine or vegan types, but ultimately suggest sunblock, a healthy diet, and procedures like laser stimulation or microneedling as more proven methods for skin health.</p>
