          <p>A 32-year-old migrant, Mohammed Sharwarq, has been sentenced to 16 weeks in jail for a series of assaults on staff and residents at an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex. The court heard that Sharwarq, who was reportedly suffering a mental breakdown, attacked four individuals, including a head chef and a cleaner. His defense stated he was traumatized by the war in Syria and now wishes to return, despite the ongoing conflict. A sexual assault charge was dropped by the prosecution before the hearing concluded.</p>

Recent examples include the Netflix film "The Thursday Murder Club," starring Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, and the popular Hulu series "Only Murders in the Building," led by Steve Martin and Martin Short. These productions highlight a trend where seasoned performers not only draw large audiences but also bring depth and experience to their roles.

The accession is expected to foster greater economic integration and political stability for the young nation, which gained independence in 2002. While membership offers new opportunities for trade and investment, there are internal concerns about whether the benefits will translate into job creation for its youthful population. The country is recognized as the most democratic in Southeast Asia, a credential that has supported its bid.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to announce an agreement with Pfizer aimed at voluntarily reducing the cost of its medications for Medicaid recipients. The deal reportedly includes discounted drug prices and a three-year pause on potential pharmaceutical tariffs, contingent on Pfizer building manufacturing facilities within the United States. This move is part of the administration's broader effort to align U.S. drug prices more closely with the lower costs found in other countries. The announcement follows a deadline Trump gave to Pfizer and other drugmakers to take action on lowering prices.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have recommended that Sean 'Diddy' Combs be sentenced to at least 11 years in prison for his conviction on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution. In a sentencing memo, they argued that despite his acquittal on more serious charges, the punishment should reflect his "decades of unchecked violence" and the psychological and physical damage inflicted on his victims. The recommendation far exceeds the defense's request for time served. Letters from victims, including Cassie Ventura, were submitted to the court urging a sentence that reflects the harm he caused.</p>

          <p>In an unusual address to top military leaders, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outlined a vision for a cultural shift at the Pentagon focused on a heightened "warrior ethos." He announced that combatants will be required to meet the "highest male standard" in physical fitness tests, a move he acknowledged may exclude some women from service. Hegseth stated the new standards must be uniform and gender-neutral, while also vowing to end policies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, which he referred to as "woke garbage." President Trump also spoke at the event, reinforcing the call to reawaken the military's warrior spirit.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are prepared to risk a partial government shutdown to secure an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire this year. The party is insisting that the subsidies be included in the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, needed to keep the government operating. Democratic leaders argue that ensuring healthcare affordability for millions of Americans is a critical priority that cannot be delayed.

The situation was further inflamed when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi linked the team's victory to a recent military operation against Pakistan.

          <p>China has introduced a new K visa program designed to attract young foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by offering streamlined entry and employment opportunities. However, the initiative has sparked criticism within the country amid a competitive domestic job market. Public concern is growing that the program may put local graduates at a disadvantage, leading to calls for greater transparency and stricter oversight to ensure fairness. The government has yet to release detailed eligibility criteria for the new visa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are facing higher coffee prices, which have surged by nearly 21% over the past year. The price spike is driven by a combination of factors, including droughts in major coffee-producing regions like Brazil and significant U.S. tariffs, including a 50% levy on Brazilian beans. Since the U.S. imports the vast majority of its coffee, these global pressures are directly impacting costs for roasters and retailers. Coffee chains are now grappling with how to manage these increased expenses, with many indicating that price hikes for customers are inevitable. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers another interest rate cut in October, financial experts are weighing the potential effects on mortgage rates. While a Fed cut often leads to lower borrowing costs, many analysts believe the market has already anticipated and priced in a 0.25% reduction. Consequently, the immediate impact on mortgage rates may be less significant than some borrowers hope. Experts note that mortgage rates are more directly influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield and broader economic data, which could cause rates to shift even before the Fed's official announcement.

          <p>Spain's meteorological agency has issued a red alert for the islands of Ibiza and Formentera due to the threat of extreme rainfall and severe flooding.

Emergency services have been deployed to rescue individuals trapped in vehicles and homes, and several main roads have been closed. Authorities have urged residents and tourists to avoid travel, stay away from low-lying areas, and seek higher ground if necessary, as the storm also brings a risk of thunderstorms.</p>

While essential services and mandatory spending like Social Security would continue, many other government functions would be disrupted. National parks and Smithsonian museums could close, and the economic impact could be significant, recalling the 35-day shutdown in 2018 that cost the economy an estimated $3 billion.</p>

His departure marks a capitulation after a months-long standoff with the state judiciary, which convicted him and barred him from holding political office for six years for flouting the decisions of the international High Representative. Dodik's withdrawal ends a period of intense political crisis during which he repeatedly threatened secession, and it now clears the way for an early presidential election in November.</p>

According to local reports and acquaintances, the 40-year-old shooter, who was killed by police, harbored a virulent hatred of the Mormon religion, which he frequently called "the antichrist." This animosity reportedly developed after a relationship with a church member ended years ago. The attack, where the suspect rammed his truck into the church before opening fire, has been labeled a "targeted act of violence" by authorities.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in a precarious political position after agreeing to a U.S.-brokered peace plan for Gaza that includes provisions he has long opposed. The deal risks the collapse of his governing coalition, as his far-right allies have threatened to leave if he makes concessions, particularly any that could lead to a Palestinian state. This analysis suggests Netanyahu's agreement may be a strategic calculation, potentially banking on Hamas to reject the deal, which would allow the war to continue with renewed American backing while shifting the blame for the diplomatic failure.</p>

He argued that these demands are irrelevant to the immediate need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government open and suggested that a debate on ACA reforms could happen at a later time.</p>
