            <p>A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson cautioned nations against conceding to US trade pressures and restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. The spokesperson emphasized that appeasement would not bring peace and warned of resolute countermeasures if any party compromised China's interests. This response follows reports of the US planning to pressure countries into imposing new trade barriers against China through tariff negotiations. The US Treasury Department and the US Trade Representative have been asked for responses to these reports. Optimism Score: 40</p>

            <p>Ukraine's military reported a series of Russian drone attacks across multiple regions shortly after the expiration of a 30-hour Easter truce declared by Moscow.

            <p>A review of the second season of HBO's *The Last of Us* critiques the show's shift towards unrelenting cheerlessness and undiluted pain, contrasting it with the first season's exploration of building bonds in impossible circumstances. While acknowledging moments of ingenuity, the review argues that the show's plot detours feel awkwardly inserted and that the limited imagination becomes more glaring as the season progresses. The review concludes that the show, by leaning so far into its characters' anguish, has become more circular and suffocating in its storytelling. Optimism Score: 40</p>
