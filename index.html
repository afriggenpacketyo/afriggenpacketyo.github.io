          <p>An article discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, a view disputed by many autism scientists. Kennedy, now a health official, has declared autism an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù and launched a research project to examine environmental suspects. However, experts argue that the increase in autism rates is mainly due to expanding definitions, awareness, and screening, with genetics playing a significant role. Researchers fear Kennedy‚Äôs focus could distract from genetic research that has led to promising new therapies.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis in its schools, leading to temporary closures and inspections. The city's health officials initially sought federal support from the CDC but were denied assistance due to restructuring within the Department of Health and Human Services. With limited resources, Milwaukee is proceeding with its own inspections and lead water line replacements, highlighting the challenges cities face when federal aid is unavailable during public health emergencies. The lack of federal expertise leaves the city to navigate a novel health threat on its own.</p>

          <p>The European Union has voiced strong disapproval of Donald Trump's plan to double US tariffs on steel and aluminum, a move that threatens to disrupt ongoing trade negotiations. The US president announced the tariff increase from 25% to 50% at a rally in Pittsburgh, citing the need to boost local industry and national supplies. The European Commission warned that this decision adds uncertainty to the global economy, increases costs for consumers and businesses, and undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution. The EU is prepared to impose countermeasures in response to the tariff increase.</p>

          <p>The popular Mexican band Grupo Firme announced the cancellation of their performance at a California music festival after the U.S. government suspended the musicians' visas. This action follows a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting Mexican artists who play music that glorifies cartel violence. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico stated that visa cases are confidential, and Grupo Firme had recently distanced itself from music glorifying criminal groups. The band's announcement came shortly after the deaths of five musicians from Grupo Fugitivo, highlighting the dangers faced by musicians in cartel-affected regions.</p>

The WFP spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said that a decision was taken to let people take aid in the event of crowds.
