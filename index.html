          <p>President Donald Trump met with over 30 business leaders from top American companies in Saudi Arabia during his Middle East tour, providing executives an opportunity to network with Saudi investors and display support for American industry. The lunch was hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and many attending companies previously contributed to Trump's inauguration fund. The event occurs amidst challenges posed by Trump's tariff and trade policies, leading corporate leaders to seek alignment with the administration. Some executives have already announced deals secured during the trip, underscoring the high stakes and potential benefits of these engagements.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in e-commerce, but warned that President Trumpâ€™s tariffs may lead to price increases. The retail giant's U.S. store sales rose over 3 percent, with e-commerce sales jumping more than 20 percent and achieving its first profitable quarter. While Walmart maintained its full-year financial forecast, executives expressed concerns about the impact of tariffs on the company's bottom line. CEO Doug McMillon stated that Walmart will strive to keep prices low but may not be able to absorb all tariff-related pressures due to narrow retail margins.

          <p>Bombas, the sock and T-shirt company known for its appearance on Shark Tank, is appointing Jason LaRose, formerly of Under Armour, as its new CEO, while founder David Heath transitions to executive chair.

LaRose plans to increase wholesale revenue from 7% to between 10% and 20% and explore opening physical stores. The company's revenue has grown 22% this fiscal year, with footwear sales expanding rapidly, but socks still show steady growth.

          <p>The UK government is engaging in talks with other nations to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The proposals focus on countries in the western Balkans, but Albania has stated they are not involved in the discussions. This initiative differs from the previous Rwanda scheme and aims to address the increasing number of individuals crossing the English Channel. The return hubs would only apply to asylum seekers without further routes of appeal in the UK, and Starmer emphasized the importance of this innovation for managing migration.</p>

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of "dry texting" and other passive-aggressive communication methods used by teenagers to avoid direct conflict. Experts suggest that ambiguous signals like leaving someone on read or unfollowing them on social media can create anxiety and confusion. While phones can sometimes help teens resolve conflicts by providing time to think, they can also disrupt the development of conflict resolution skills. Some teens find that phones make it easier to ignore someone they donâ€™t want to talk to, leading to feelings of being excluded or not worth a real explanation.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported a slight dip in first-quarter profit and announced it will raise prices due to increased costs from President Trump's tariffs.

Fiscal hawks are alarmed, with major bond investors like Stephen Jen warning of a potential "disaster." Despite Trump's claims of securing deals to bolster American businesses, long-dated bonds have not rebounded, suggesting bond vigilantes may check the Trump agenda if the proposed budget vastly increases the national debt.</p>

The government first granted the bird federal protection in 2014, which was then tossed out in 2015, and then relisted in 2023.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after it grew by more than expected in the first three months of the year. The 0.7% growth was described as "very encouraging", although shadow chancellor Mel Stride cautioned against premature celebration. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts warned that the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue. The Labour government made boosting the economy its top priority when it came to power last year.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of the year, exceeding expectations, but this level of growth is not predicted to last. Higher growth rates typically mean more jobs are created and people have more money to spend. The UK's growth rate was the highest in the G7, despite the impact of US tariffs. However, the full effects of Trump's tariffs are yet to be seen, and economists expect UK exports to the US may fall, slowing growth.</p>

Republicans are divided over spending cuts, with fiscal conservatives arguing for more cuts and moderates concerned about the impact on working-class Americans.

Scientists believe the bloom was driven by a marine heatwave and calm marine conditions.

Trump's views on white farmers in South Africa have been influenced by meetings with Afrikaner activists and conversations with golfer Gary Player. The administration's actions reflect a focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs and a belief that white South Africans are being persecuted.
