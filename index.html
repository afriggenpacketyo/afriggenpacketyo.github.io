          <p>The article examines the often-overlooked role of personal finance, including pensions, investments, and banking decisions, in contributing to the climate crisis by funding fossil fuel projects. It highlights that switching to a sustainable pension provider can significantly reduce a person's carbon footprint, dwarfing the impact of other lifestyle changes. The world's largest banks have invested trillions in the fossil fuel industry since the Paris Agreement, funding expansion plans that contradict climate warnings. While it's challenging to quantify the precise impact, experts emphasize that our money, even in current accounts, can indirectly support fossil fuel companies, therefore it's crucial to consider green finance alternatives such as green banks and sustainable investment funds. The summary underscores the need for greater awareness and regulation in the green finance sector to combat greenwashing and promote transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite international calls for de-escalation, Russia and Ukraine have continued their cross-border drone attacks, with Ukrainian officials reporting that they intercepted 288 drones and all missiles, while Russia claims to have downed 128 Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating that Russia can only be brought to justice through force, specifically the force of the United States and Europe, and urged for tougher sanctions. President Trump criticized Putin's actions, expressing his disapproval of the ongoing violence, but also attacked Zelenskyy for causing problems with his statements. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia appreciates Trump's assistance in organizing the negotiation process and is closely monitoring the emotional reactions connected to the peace process. The article highlights the growing intensity of the conflict and the challenges in achieving a ceasefire or peace deal, with both sides trading accusations and appeals for international intervention. The summary provides context on the ongoing conflict, the perspectives of key leaders, and the implications for international relations. The ongoing strikes are evidence that Moscow is not genuine in its public appeals for peace.</p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a program to temporarily host international students from Harvard University if the U.S. government moves to bar them from studying at the American institution. This action is inspired by a similar program launched in 2022 to support researchers and students affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing research labs and accommodations free of charge. The U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has sought to end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, but a temporary injunction issued by a U.S. federal district court has allowed international students to remain enrolled while the legality of the administration's decision is reviewed. The Japanese university is still exploring the details of the potential program.</p>

          <p>Members of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), a key party in the ruling coalition, are urging a cessation of weapon supplies to Israel due to concerns over humanitarian disasters and violations of international law in Gaza. Adis Ahmetovic, a foreign policy spokesperson for the SPD, emphasized that German weapons should not contribute to such crises. Ralf Stegner, also from the SPD, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the need to end the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population and adherence to international law. While Germany has historically supported Israel's security due to its responsibility stemming from the Holocaust, these lawmakers argue that the current situation in Gaza and the West Bank does not justify continued arms shipments.</p>

          <p>LEVA, an autonomous delivery robot developed by ETH Zurich, is designed to navigate complex environments and autonomously lift and carry heavy cargo. Combining wheels and legs, LEVA can roll on smooth surfaces and walk or climb over obstacles like stairs and curbs. Equipped with GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras, LEVA can perceive its surroundings, avoid obstacles, and align itself for cargo pick-up and drop-off. LEVA can lift and carry boxes weighing up to 187 pounds, making it suitable for various applications, including package delivery, farm supply transport, construction site material handling, and emergency response, which means faster, more reliable deliveries, especially in urban areas. The team is working to improve LEVA's energy efficiency, stair-climbing ability, and autonomous operation for real-world deployment.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's attacks on Harvard University, which began after the university refused to comply with demands regarding viewpoint diversity. Kristi Noem's revocation of Harvard's certification to host international students was temporarily halted by a court order. The author argues that these attacks extend beyond Harvard and higher education, representing a weaponization of the state against anyone who incurs Trump's displeasure. The administration's actions, including freezing research funds and making unsubstantiated claims, align with authoritarian populist tactics. The author urges universities to stand together and educate the public about the broader implications of these attacks, which harm American soft power and innovation.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is facing criticism from environmental groups for accepting campaign contributions from the oil industry while running for governor in 2026, despite his past record as an environmental champion. Villaraigosa defends his support for the oil industry by warning of potential gas price increases due to refinery closures and advocating for an "all-of-the-above" energy approach. Environmental activists view his actions as a violation of a previous pledge not to accept contributions from oil companies, while Villaraigosa argues that the current economic climate necessitates a focus on working-class Americans' cost-of-living concerns. Political analysts suggest that Villaraigosa is positioning himself as a moderate in the governor's race, potentially appealing to voters concerned about the rising cost of living in California.</p>

In addition to tariffs, the leaders are likely to discuss the civil war in Myanmar and stress the need for humanitarian assistance.

          <p>King Charles is scheduled to visit Canada for the first time since his coronation to deliver the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th session of Canada's parliament. This marks the first time a king has opened a new session of parliament, with the last monarch to read the speech being Elizabeth II in 1977. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to the King is seen as a strategic move amid strained relations between Canada and the U.S. The visit will include a tree-planting ceremony, meetings with Canadian leaders, and a military escort to the Senate for the throne speech, highlighting the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown.</p>

          <p>Author Sir Salman Rushdie has stated that he is "pleased" with the maximum possible prison sentence given to his attacker, Hadi Matar, who was jailed for 25 years for attempted murder after stabbing Rushdie in 2022.

He also paid tribute to the BBC's former creative director, Alan Yentob, who recently passed away, praising his friendship and support.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court has overturned the perjury conviction of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. The allegations stemmed from Kurz's statements regarding his role in appointing executives for the ÖBAG state holding company in 2020. Kurz argued that he was interrupted during his testimony and that the judge was biased. Despite the acquittal, Kurz remains under investigation for corruption in a separate case involving the alleged embezzlement of state funds. He resigned as chancellor in 2021 amid allegations of financial impropriety.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian cities following indications that President Trump is stepping away from diplomatic efforts to secure a truce. Ukrainian officials reported numerous casualties as Russian forces launched heavy missile and drone barrages. Analysts suggest that Russia is exploiting the situation as the United States reduces military assistance to Ukraine. While Trump condemned the attacks, he has not committed to providing additional military aid. Russia continues to upgrade its arsenal, making it more difficult for Ukraine to intercept incoming missiles. Valery Zaluzhny, a former top commander of Ukraine’s military, warned of a grim future for the country.</p>

The film, which interviewed ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, exposed the collaboration and indifference of many French people during the war. Although controversial, the film was highly influential and paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France.

Trump criticized Cook publicly and threatened new tariffs, impacting Apple's global supply chain. The shift comes amidst other challenges for Apple, including a legal defeat in an App Store trial and doubts about its competitiveness in artificial intelligence.

Domestic battery factories rely on Chinese components and federal subsidies, but tariffs have already increased costs for U.S. buyers.

This policy shift could affect the pace at which the U.S. transitions to renewable energy and the cost of electricity.

          <p>President Trump's recent actions suggest he envisions a world where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This concept, reminiscent of 19th-century imperialism, is reflected in Trump's desire to expand American influence in the Western Hemisphere and his praise for leaders Putin and Xi. Trump's approach to Ukraine and his stance on trade are seen as consistent with this vision. However, efforts to establish spheres of influence have faced resistance, and the long-term implications of this approach remain uncertain.
