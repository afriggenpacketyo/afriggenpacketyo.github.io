            <p>The stock market experienced a significant surge after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on "reciprocal tariffs" for most countries, coupled with a reduction to 10% effective immediately. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by 7.9%, the S&P 500 climbed 9.5%, and the Nasdaq composite index increased by 12.2%. China is a notable exception, as Trump is increasing tariffs on goods imported from that nation to 125% due to perceived disrespect towards world markets. The market's rise comes after a period of investor anxiety fueled by the escalating trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson postponed a vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint, which would fund President Trump's agenda, due to dissatisfaction from a subset of Republican members. Johnson had been working with Trump to persuade GOP holdouts to support the legislation, which requires near-unanimous Republican support to pass the House. The postponement follows a narrow passage of a procedural rule that included the budget blueprint, indicating significant internal divisions within the Republican caucus. The vote was also connected to blocking future House votes on rescinding Trump's tariffs.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. lauded the U.S. measles response as a "model for the rest of the world," drawing comparisons to higher case numbers in Europe. However, experts caution against broad comparisons due to disparities in healthcare access, vaccination coverage, and surveillance systems. While the U.S. has seen over 600 cases this year, primarily linked to an outbreak in Texas, Europe's numbers are driven by specific countries with lower vaccination rates. The discussion underscores the importance of vaccination and accurate data analysis in public health.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed a method to overcome metal fatigue by transforming common stainless steel into a stronger, more resilient material suitable for aerospace and high-grade applications. By twisting the steel's internal structure, the team more than doubled its yield strength and increased its resistance to fatigue damage by up to 10,000 times. Potential applications include undersea pipelines and engine components, offering technological support to high-end equipment manufacturing and engineering sectors. The process involves altering the material's internal structure without visible changes to the surface.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's assault on global trade has scrambled ideological alliances, with the Chinese Embassy promoting a 1987 video of Ronald Reagan inveighing against protectionism. A Republican senator told Trumpâs trade representative that he would give the administration space to test its ânovel approachâ but wanted to know: âWhose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?â This highlights the uneasy truce within the Republican party regarding Trump's trade policies.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has ordered the justice department to investigate a whistleblower and a cybersecurity director who refuted unfounded claims of election fraud. The US president signed memorandums targeting Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs, former homeland security officials who served in the first Trump administration. Taylor had worked in the George W Bush administration and as a senior aide on Capitol Hill. Trump also took action against Krebs, who served as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>

These include avoiding panic, recognizing the risks of greed, understanding the president's inclination for drama, and investing in strong companies. Cramer emphasizes that investors should stay the course, avoid short-selling good companies, and anticipate potential policy shifts from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again. Politically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. But is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?</p>

But Villa are unbeaten in front of their own fans this season in the Champions League - even recording a home league phase win over six-time winners Bayern Munich.</p>
