        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court considered whether President Trump could continue deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles to aid federal immigration authorities, facing skepticism from the judges regarding the state's arguments against the mobilization. The Justice Department argued that the president's decision was unreviewable by the courts, warning that siding with California would put judges in conflict with the commander-in-chief, while California argued that the deployment circumvented the governor and risked escalating tensions. Judges questioned both sides on the scope of presidential authority and the necessity of consulting with the governor, as the legal battle centered on whether Trump exceeded his authority under Title 10 in response to protests against immigration raids. The court's decision will determine the extent of presidential power in deploying the National Guard during domestic unrest.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering a military strike against Iran amid escalating tensions, demanding that Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei "surrender" in the ongoing conflict with Israel. Trump warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows his location, stating that U.S. patience is wearing thin. While Trump indicated he doesn't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers, he made it clear that he seeks Iran's "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by masked ICE agents at federal immigration court while observing proceedings. Lander was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of court, with his office stating he was there to prevent ICE arrests. He was later released, with charges dropped, and expressed concern for the individual he was assisting, who remains in ICE detention without legal representation. The incident sparked outrage from officials like Governor Hochul and the ACLU, who condemned it as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy, while Lander's wife described the event as a violation of due process.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are expressing alarm over proposed changes to Medicaid within President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," particularly regarding the provider tax rate. The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill lowers the provider tax rate in Medicaid expansion states, a move that some Republicans fear could harm rural hospitals and jeopardize benefits for working Americans. Senator Hawley criticized the changes, arguing they would negatively impact states with rural hospitals, while Senator Murkowski also expressed dissatisfaction with the Medicaid provisions. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Oz defended the changes, stating that the provider tax is often used to benefit institutions with government connections rather than those most in need.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in a multiday effort to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, including the underground uranium enrichment site at Fordo. Fordo is believed to be a key location for Iran's nuclear weapons program. While some of Trump's advisors agree on the course of action, there is not full agreement among Mr. Trump's closest advisers on how to proceed. Trump has stated the U.S. now has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran" and knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, while also issuing a warning to Iran not to touch U.S. troops.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates a reduction in the company's corporate workforce in the coming years due to the increasing use of AI agents in the workplace. Jassy stated that as generative AI tools are implemented, fewer people will be needed to perform certain jobs, leading to efficiency gains across the company. Amazon is investing heavily in AI technology, with plans to develop numerous AI agents to automate tasks and free up human workers for more creative roles.

The posts sparked immediate backlash from Democrats, who condemned Lee for politicizing the tragedy and inciting violence, and Senator Klobuchar stated that she had a "good discussion" with Lee, and was glad he took them down.

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The law will prevent women who terminate their pregnancies outside of the current legal framework from being prosecuted, although anyone assisting a woman in getting an abortion outside the legal framework will still be penalized. The amendment was put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi and won support from 379 MPs. While the new clause will not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, campaigners welcomed the decision, while the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said it was "horrified" by the vote.</p>

          <p>Israel's military campaign against Iran has raised questions about its true objectives, with some suggesting it aims to overthrow the Islamic Republic rather than solely dismantle its nuclear program. While Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated that stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions is the primary goal, the targeting of Iranian state infrastructure and military leaders indicates a broader agenda. The situation has divided the Trump administration, with some officials advocating for regime change while others prioritize de-escalation and diplomacy. A regime change may lead to instability in the region.</p>

          <p>The Republican's budget package proposes expanding work requirements for millions of Americans receiving Medicaid and food stamps, a move that some experts say will be ineffective. While Republicans argue that tying federal aid to work encourages employment and prevents people from "gaming the system," research indicates that work requirements often lead to recipients losing benefits due to administrative hurdles and other challenges. Studies have shown that work requirements do not necessarily boost employment and may disproportionately affect older Americans and those with health issues. The new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance.</p>
