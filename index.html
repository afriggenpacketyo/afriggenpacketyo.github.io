          <p>The Minnesota Vikings publicly condemned the racist messages directed at defensive back Isaiah Rodgers following the team's loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Rodgers himself shared the hateful comments, which included racial slurs, on social media, stating that racism is real and these were not even the worst he had seen. The team's official statement expressed disgust and firmly declared there is no room for racist words or actions in sports or society. This incident highlights the persistent issue of online racial abuse targeting athletes and underscores the importance of collective action to combat such prejudice and ensure player well-being.</p>

          <p>Demolition has begun on parts of the White House's East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump's planned $250 million ballroom. Trump announced the "much-needed" project on social media, claiming it is privately funded by "generous Patriots" and "Great American Companies" at no cost to taxpayers. The East Wing, last modified in 1942, is being "fully modernised" as part of the process, which is expected to be the largest addition to the presidential residence in over a century. Concerns about transparency and historical preservation have been raised by historians and critics.</p>

          <p>The body of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman missing for two weeks, was found buried in a shallow grave behind an abandoned Philadelphia school following an anonymous tip. Authorities confirmed her identity through DNA tests. Keon King, 21, has been arrested and charged with kidnapping, stalking, and other offenses in connection with her disappearance, with prosecutors expecting to bring homicide charges. Evidence includes cellphone contact, a stolen and burned vehicle linked to King, and extensive video surveillance. Investigators believe other individuals may have been involved after the fact, with the investigation ongoing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police's new lead on phone theft, Commander Andy Featherstone, admitted the force's efforts have not been "good enough," with only just over 1% of phone thefts resulting in a charge or conviction. He highlighted a revised strategy targeting organized crime, which recently led to 18 arrests and the seizure of 2,000 handsets, believed to be linked to 40% of London's phone thefts. The Met notes that organized crime groups find phone theft lucrative, with devices fetching high prices abroad. This commitment signals a more serious approach to tackling the rising "epidemic" of phone thefts in the city.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with US President Donald Trump, securing renewed commitment to the Aukus defense pact and a critical minerals investment deal. Despite the positive outcome, Australia harbors growing doubts about the reliability of its long-standing US alliance, particularly under Trump's "America First" policies, which previously imposed tariffs. The review of Aukus and challenges in securing a meeting fueled anxieties in Canberra, reflecting a broader shift in Australian sentiment. While the alliance remains crucial for countering China's regional influence, a critical eye is now cast on the relationship.</p>

          <p>The UK's new sentencing bill, designed to alleviate dangerously overcrowded prisons, proposes an "earned progression scheme" allowing some offenders early release after serving a third of their sentence for good behavior. The Conservative opposition argues this would cut jail time for over 2,000 individuals convicted of serious crimes, including sexual assault, stalking, and grievous bodily harm, calling it a "betrayal of victims." Labour, in turn, accuses the Tories of hypocrisy for creating the prison crisis. The debate centers on balancing prison capacity with public safety and victim concerns, with the bill facing amendments.</p>

          <p>Decades of US-Colombia alliance are jeopardized as relations hit a new low, marked by increased US airstrikes off Colombia's coast and a bitter exchange of insults between President Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Trump labeled Petro an "illegal drug dealer" and threatened to suspend aid and impose tariffs, while Petro accused the US of murder following a strike that allegedly killed a Colombian fisherman. Petro also criticized the US military buildup in the Caribbean, seen as an attempt to oust Venezuela's leader. This crisis threatens regional stability and could empower drug traffickers, according to analysts.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the government shutdown, now in its third week, is "likely to end sometime this week." He suggested that moderate Democrats might be pressured to move forward after this weekend's "No Kings" protests. Hassett also warned that the Trump administration might impose "stronger measures" if Democrats do not cooperate, highlighting the partisan gridlock over federal funding and healthcare protections. The Senate has repeatedly failed to pass a short-term resolution, with Democrats insisting on including enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

Nuno, yet to secure a win after three games, acknowledged the team's poor performance and the fans' anxiety, emphasizing the players' responsibility to earn back support. The protests, organized by Hammers United, demand the departure of chairman David Sullivan and vice-chair Karren Brady, citing unkept promises and a lost club essence.</p>

While younger generations are more worried about a future recession, Gen X shows the least confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability to combat inflation.

He highlighted strong demand, pricing stability, and future growth potential from new devices like a foldable iPhone and lucrative monetization of its ecosystem, such as Google's default search engine payment.

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the US agency responsible for safeguarding the country's nuclear stockpile and preventing proliferation, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees as the government shutdown enters its 20th day. This unprecedented move for the NNSA leaves fewer than 400 staff, with a spokesperson stating they "are left with no choice." While the nuclear stockpile remains secure, the furloughs are expected to hamper efforts to modernize older weapons.

          <p>A US appeals court has overturned a temporary restraining order, ruling that the Trump administration can deploy Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, despite objections from local officials. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel found it likely that the President lawfully exercised his authority, contrasting with a lower court's finding that Trump's claims about the city were "untethered to the facts." While this specific ruling allows federalization of Oregon troops, a broader order still prevents any state's National Guard from deploying to Portland for now. The decision highlights an ongoing legal and political battle over federal military deployments in Democratic-led cities.</p>

This "slop"—spammy, contextless AI material—is pervasive, from social media feeds to news and propaganda, leading to widespread disorientation and doubt about content authenticity. The article argues that this trend represents a "creativity without craft," where the frictionless generation of ideas devalues the meaningful labor of human creation. This influx of synthetic junk threatens to degrade the quality of information, erode human connection, and create feedback loops of recursive, error-prone data.</p>

The Home Office denied claims of watering down the inquiry, reaffirming its commitment to a robust investigation and stating it will not shy away from reporting racial or religious motives behind grooming gangs.</p>
