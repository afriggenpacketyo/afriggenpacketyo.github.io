          <h2>Trump and Netanyahu Clash Over Iran Nuclear Deal Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration engages in nuclear deal negotiations with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is reportedly advocating for military action against Iranian nuclear facilities, creating tension between the two leaders. Netanyahu believes Iran's perceived vulnerability presents a limited window for attack, while Trump favors leveraging Iran's weakness to negotiate a peaceful end to its enrichment program, backed by the threat of military force if talks fail. This account is based on interviews with officials in the United States, Europe, and Israel, who have been involved in the diplomacy and the debate between the American and Israeli governments. Trump has acknowledged warning Netanyahu against launching an attack while negotiations are underway, further highlighting the disagreement between the two allies. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Skittles in the US are now manufactured without titanium dioxide, a color additive that was banned in the European Union in 2022 due to potential health risks. Mars, the maker of Skittles, stated that it stopped using the ingredient in its US Skittles portfolio at the end of last year, after years of criticism. The move follows concerns about processed foods to the front of public health debates, and Mars had previously committed to removing all artificial colors from its foods by 2016. The company did not specify if the change would extend to Skittles sold outside the US, but emphasized its commitment to product safety and quality. The optimism score is 75.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FEMA has rejected North Carolina's request for 100% federal cost-sharing for Hurricane Helene relief, a decision that Governor Josh Stein says will cost the state's residents millions of dollars. The cost-sharing request stemmed from a Biden administration directive to match 100% of state funds for disaster cleanup, but the acting FEMA administrator cited a lack of justification for extending this arrangement. This denial occurs as the Department of Homeland Security considers eliminating FEMA while maintaining state disaster funding, with Secretary Kristi Noem criticizing FEMA's performance. An internal review also indicated that FEMA is unprepared for the upcoming hurricane season, citing staffing limitations and coordination issues. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Irish rap group Kneecap has cancelled its performance at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow due to police concerns about safety. These concerns arose after a band member was charged with a terror offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig. Additionally, criticism stemmed from 2023 footage appearing to show a band member making controversial statements about political figures. The band will perform at the Glastonbury festival and will hold a separate show at Glasgow's O2 Academy as compensation for the cancellation. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges due to declining sales in China, slumping demand for electric vehicles, and new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company has scaled back its forecast for the year by approximately $2.2 billion and expects a drop in profit margin.

          <p>A California inmate, Heraclio Sanchez Rodriguez, is accused of leading a major drug trafficking network in Alaska from his prison cell, with a lawyer, Justin Facey, allegedly assisting him. Facey, now charged with drug and weapons offenses, reportedly referred to his work with Sanchez as being part of “the cartel.” Text messages revealed Facey discussing drug deliveries, laundering money, and even arranging for a private plane to help an associate evade arrest. Prosecutors claim Facey became a drug dealer himself after his law license was suspended, boasting about his newfound wealth due to his connection with Sanchez. The optimism score is 15.</p>

          <p>China has shifted from being a major lender to the largest debt collector in the developing world, potentially undermining poverty reduction efforts and fueling instability.
