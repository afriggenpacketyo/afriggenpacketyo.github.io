        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Betfred's co-founder, Fred Done, has warned that a proposed increase in gambling taxes by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves could force the closure of all 1,287 of the company's high street shops, placing 7,500 jobs at risk. He stated that even a moderate tax hike to 35-40% would eliminate profitability, echoing similar concerns from other betting firms like William Hill. The potential tax increase, suggested as a way to fund child poverty reduction, is seen by the industry as economically reckless and could drive betting to untaxed offshore markets.

          <p>Over the past four decades, China's Baijitan National Nature Reserve has made significant strides in combating desertification in the arid Ningxia region. The reserve has effectively pushed back the encroaching Mu Us Desert by more than 20 kilometers, safeguarding the regional capital of Yinchuan and the vital Yellow River. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts covering tens of thousands of hectares, the project has stabilized vast areas of drifting sands. What was once a severe threat to agriculture and livelihoods has been transformed into a successful example of ecological restoration.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor reporting on the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski discovered a surprising link to her own past. The central figure in the case, Shymanski's ex-wife Heather Snyder, was the reporter's high school acquaintance. While Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, Snyder herself was never charged despite being the only known link between the victim and the killer. The article delves into the reporter's exclusive interview with Snyder, who addressed suspicions from the victim's family and explained her decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment at Holbrook's trial.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of committing "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after a US strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters. Petro stated the vessel belonged to a fisherman with no drug ties and was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure. The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement that the US had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," killing two people. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly US strikes in the Caribbean aimed at curbing drug trafficking, which have been criticized by UN experts as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians within Gaza, which it says would be a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department stated such an act would undermine recent progress and that measures would be taken to protect Gazans and preserve the ceasefire. Hamas has rejected the US statement as false, even as it has been re-establishing control in the region. The warning comes as the first phase of the ceasefire deal, involving hostage and prisoner exchanges, is still in progress.</p>

          <p>German historian Jürgen Matthäus has identified the Nazi gunman in the iconic and harrowing photograph known as "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa." The perpetrator is believed to be Jakobus Onnen, a member of the SS Einsatzgruppe C, which was responsible for mass murders in Eastern Europe. The breakthrough came after the discovery of a higher-quality print of the photo, which correctly placed the atrocity in Berdychiv, Ukraine, in July 1941. With the help of a relative's tip and AI-based facial recognition, Onnen was identified with 99% certainty, providing a name to the perpetrator in one of the Holocaust's most chilling images.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris stated that former President Joe Biden made a "big mistake" by not inviting Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a 2021 White House event focused on electric vehicles. Speaking at a summit, Harris argued that despite Tesla's non-unionized workforce, it was illogical to exclude the nation's leading EV manufacturer from such an important discussion. She believes the snub, widely seen as a pro-union gesture, deeply affected Musk and may have influenced his subsequent political alignments. In her new memoir, Harris wrote that Musk "never forgave" the exclusion, which she felt alienated a key innovator.</p>

This comes as King Charles III faces calls to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following Andrew's decision to relinquish his other titles like Duke of York. The developments add to the pressure on the prince over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with Prince William also reportedly unsatisfied with the current outcome.</p>

Both sergeants were stabbed and slashed before a third officer, PC Marcus Wolstencroft, subdued the assailant with a Taser.

          <p>Despite a significant summer spending spree, Liverpool has experienced a downturn in form, which this article attributes in part to the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. The analysis highlights how the team is missing his exceptional on-ball quality, particularly his ability to use his weaker foot and play long, switching passes to bypass high presses and break down defensive blocks. His absence has forced tactical compromises, such as new signing Florian Wirtz playing deeper, which limits his attacking effectiveness. The team's struggles in building play from the back are now a key vulnerability for opponents to exploit.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Lufthansa and Salesforce, have recently announced significant job cuts, citing the increased efficiency and adoption of artificial intelligence. However, some critics and academics argue that AI is being used as a "good excuse" or a scapegoat for layoffs that may be due to other factors, such as overhiring during the pandemic. Experts suggest that blaming AI allows companies to appear innovative while deflecting from potential mismanagement or economic slowdowns. Despite the headlines, recent economic data indicates that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual frequency and desire to decrease after the initial passionate phase of a long-term relationship, according to psychologists. This shift is partly hormonal, as the bonding hormone oxytocin, which becomes more prominent over time, can dampen the hormones that drive initial sex drive. Research also highlights a discrepancy between physical and psychological arousal, particularly in heterosexual women, whose satisfaction is often not prioritized. Experts emphasize that open communication about needs, maintaining physical affection, and prioritizing intimacy are key for couples to navigate this natural change and maintain a satisfying relationship.</p>

          <p>UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava overcame a late-game knee injury to lead a dramatic game-winning drive, securing a 20-17 comeback victory against Maryland. After being cleared to return with just 35 seconds left, Iamaleava guided the Bruins into field goal range in four quick plays. Kicker Mateen Bhaghani then converted a 23-yard field goal with two seconds remaining to seal the win. The victory marks UCLA's third consecutive win, continuing an improbable midseason turnaround after starting the season 0-4 and pushing their record to 3-4.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 5 Freeway in Southern California was closed for several hours on Saturday for a live-fire military event at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance. The closure, affecting a route used by approximately 80,000 drivers daily, was implemented despite the Marine Corps' initial assurance that no public highways would be affected. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the event as an "absurd show of force" and a dangerous disregard for public safety. The Marine Corps stated it did not request the closure, which was recommended by the California Highway Patrol due to safety risks.</p>
