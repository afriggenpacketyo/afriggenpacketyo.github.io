          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Immigrants' Right to Challenge Detention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 05:12:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stephen Miller, a White House aide, indicated that the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of suspending immigrants' right to challenge their detention in court before deportation, citing the Constitution's provision for suspending habeas corpus during an invasion. Legal experts, however, argue that only Congress has the authority to suspend habeas corpus and that the administration's justification of an 'invasion' by migrants is legally dubious, especially given recent court rulings. This move signals a significant escalation in the administration's conflict with the courts over immigration policies, potentially leading to further legal challenges and constitutional debates.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer associated with the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement, as the next U.S. Surgeon General. Means, who describes herself as a 'former surgeon turned metabolic health evangelist', has gained prominence through her book 'Good Energy' and appearances on popular podcasts, advocating for alternative health approaches and expressing vaccine skepticism. Her views align with those of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., focusing on tackling chronic diseases and promoting a healthier food supply, but her lack of board certification and controversial stances have raised concerns among medical professionals.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, is suing Google for complying with a decree by former U.S. President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mexico argues that Google should differentiate between the U.S. and Mexican territorial waters when applying the name. Google claims its policy is to follow official U.S. government geographic designations, but Mexico's Foreign Ministry has sent letters requesting the company not to label Mexican waters with the new name.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a music conductor diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS) and adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS). After medications became less effective, Laycock underwent brain implant surgery and received DBS therapy, which delivers electrical currents to specific areas of the brain. He later transitioned to aDBS, a more advanced form that adapts stimulation in real time to better control fluctuating symptoms. As a result, Laycock's tremors are nearly gone, and his dyskinesia is well-managed, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supplies, aiming to leverage economic dependence as a tool against foreign pressure. This involves increasing exports, investing heavily in manufacturing, and utilizing economic warfare tactics like export controls. While China still relies on the West for some advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize supply chains marks a significant challenge to U.S. supremacy and may lead to a divided world with competing spheres of influence. However, this strategy also carries costs for China, including strained relations with trading partners and economic imbalances.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in 1972, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere, raising concerns about where it might land. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for over 50 years and is now spiraling back towards Earth. Experts estimate that some parts of the spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, could survive the re-entry, though the exact landing location remains unknown and the risk of injury on the ground is low.</p>
