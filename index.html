            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, accusing Senator Chris Van Hollen of supporting a gang member and public safety threat. Homan argued that the administration acted within the law, citing the Alien Enemies Act, while Van Hollen emphasized the importance of due process. The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, and the case has sparked debate over the due process rights of undocumented immigrants. Optimism score: 30</p>
