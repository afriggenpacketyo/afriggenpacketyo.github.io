          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 annually, with students with disabilities eligible for up to $30,000, and home-schooled students getting $2,000 a year. While supporters like President Trump and Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrate this as a victory for parental freedom and educational options, Democrats such as State Senator Sarah Eckhardt argue it will siphon funds from underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families already in private education.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will be honored with a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his refusal to endorse false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Pence, as Vice President, resisted pressure from Trump to overturn the election results during the Congressional certification on January 6, 2021, despite facing public criticism and threats, including chants of "hang Mike Pence" during the Capitol riot. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for prioritizing the constitutional transfer of presidential power, a decision that has distanced him from Trump and the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Teuchitlán, Mexico, José Murguía Santiago, has been arrested as part of an investigation into a suspected drug cartel training camp where human remains and clothing were discovered. The investigation focuses on possible omissions or complicity of authorities with the Jalisco New Generation cartel, known for its extreme violence. The "ranch of horror" was initially discovered in September 2024, but a more thorough search months later revealed additional evidence, raising questions about the initial investigation. The cartel allegedly used the ranch to train newly recruited gunmen, and authorities have arrested about a dozen others in connection with the case.</p>

          <p>According to this article, President Trump's expansion of executive power goes beyond traditional conservative legal theories, drawing on a longer tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule. Thinkers like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule, along with the Claremont Institute, provide the intellectual basis for this approach, which seeks to roll back the administrative state and consolidate power in the presidency. This perspective views liberalism as weak and emphasizes the need for a sovereign decider, leading to concerns about the transformation of the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers.</p>

Crawford, though a highly skilled boxer, will move up two weight divisions to challenge Álvarez, raising concerns about his size disadvantage. Despite Crawford's talent, Julio César Chávez predicts Álvarez will win by knockout, similar to Álvarez's fight against Amir Khan, where Khan performed well until the size difference became too much. With the event promoted by Turki Alalshikh and Dana White, some suspect the fight will be another mismatch, continuing the trend of unequal matchups in Álvarez's recent fights.</p>

          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth anticipates a difficult confirmation hearing for Mike Waltz, nominated as U.N. ambassador after his departure as President Trump's national security adviser. Duckworth argues that Waltz is unqualified due to his participation in a Signal chain that inadvertently included a journalist and contained classified information. She believes everyone involved in the chat should be terminated, asserting that Waltz is "failing up" into the ambassador role. Duckworth also criticizes Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and expresses concerns about Marco Rubio juggling multiple roles.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and cost overruns, raising questions about America's ability to build large-scale infrastructure. The project, initially intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now focused on a 171-mile segment between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser disputes claims that land acquisition is the primary cause of the delays, citing other factors such as environmental reviews and lack of funding. The project has disrupted farmland and local communities, leading to complex negotiations over compensation.</p>

The phrase is often a symptom of a deeper dysfunction, namely the fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. It's better to communicate what you need clearly, without shame or comparison.</p>
