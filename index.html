          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham discusses the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk within the broader context of American history. He posits that political violence often emerges when the nation confronts existential questions about identity and belonging, leading to profound societal friction. Meacham warns that using violence to settle political disputes violates the American principle of peaceful debate and dissent, and he urges leaders to learn from historical precedents of overcoming division to navigate the country through this perilous time.</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist James Fallows offers a commentary on the recent wave of political violence in America, including the killing of Charlie Kirk, drawing parallels to the tumultuous 1960s. He warns that cycles of political violence are deeply damaging and self-reinforcing, and cautions against loose talk of "civil war." Fallows urges for generous immediate reactions, citing President George W. Bush's outreach to American Muslims after 9/11 and Robert F. Kennedy's impromptu speech on the night of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination as examples of leadership that can help tame societal savageness.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III weighed in on the viral "Phillies Karen" incident, where a fan aggressively demanded a home run ball from a father and his young son. Griffin sided with the family, stating that since the woman dropped the ball, she forfeited her claim to it, and humorously advised her to get "better hands." He also recounted an odd fan interaction from his own career, where a person who appeared to be in a wheelchair to get an autograph was later seen walking freely, highlighting the extreme lengths some fans will go for memorabilia.</p>

          <p>In a joint interview, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford addressed the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the escalating political division in the United States. Both senators condemned the violence, attributing the rise in extremism to the polarizing effects of social media algorithms that amplify anger and extreme views. They discussed the increasing security threats faced by public officials and their families, and called for bipartisan efforts, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate online harms and encourage civil discourse.</p>

          <p>Following a large protest in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the national flag will not be surrendered to those who use it to promote violence and division. The "Unite the Kingdom" march drew over 150,000 participants and resulted in clashes with a smaller counter-protest, leaving 26 police officers injured. Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation will not be tolerated, asserting that the flag represents Britain's diversity, tolerance, and respect.</p>

          <p>France staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Ireland 18-13 in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, securing their spot in the semi-finals. Ireland established a dominant 13-0 lead in the first half, but failed to capitalize further despite France receiving two yellow cards. A crucial defensive stand by the French at the end of the half proved pivotal. In the second half, France scored 18 unanswered points, with a key breakaway try from Joanna Grisez sealing the victory and ending Ireland's hopes of reaching their first semi-final since 2014.</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition, "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offering a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While his peers focused on traditional subjects, Caillebotte's work distinctively centered on male figures in domestic and urban settings, sometimes in ways that scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition explores the unique, and at times sensuous, nature of his paintings, inviting modern interpretations of his artistry and his focus on the male form, and solidifying his place within the Impressionist movement beyond his famous work, "Paris Street; Rainy Day."</p>

The Romanian military tracked the drone before it disappeared from radar, stating it did not fly over populated areas.

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are weighing in on the key matchups and potential champions. The Minnesota Lynx, driven by a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, are seen as a top contender, led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier and the league's best defense. The Las Vegas Aces, however, are entering the postseason on a 16-game winning streak and remain a formidable threat for a third title in four years. Analysts also discuss which high seeds are at risk and which players will be most crucial to their team's success.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that every person, regardless of their status, should be held accountable under the law and that the Prince has not faced sufficient consequences. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability, but her family insists that justice has not yet been served.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a state law passed in August that permits individuals with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses. While it is not yet clear if the suspected shooter was legally carrying the weapon, the incident highlights the ongoing debate over gun laws in the state. Utah has some of the nation's most permissive gun regulations, including permitless carry and a lack of 'red-flag' laws, reflecting a legislative belief that widespread gun ownership can deter crime, a stance now being questioned in the context of targeted political violence.</p>

          <p>The administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may be increasing the burden on parents, particularly mothers, by promoting strict and sometimes scientifically unsupported dietary rules. The movement's condemnation of common ingredients like seed oils and processed foods forces parents into time-consuming and expensive shopping habits, often requiring visits to multiple stores to find compliant products. Critics argue that while the campaign aims to improve children's health, it lacks substantive policy support and places additional psychological and financial stress on families already struggling with food insecurity and budgeting.</p>

Despite the team's winning record, Manning's difficulties have raised concerns about the Longhorns' viability as title contenders as they head into their challenging SEC schedule, though his coach and teammates have publicly expressed continued confidence in him.</p>

          <p>This analysis examines the successful New York mayoral primary campaign of progressive Democrat Zohran Mamdani and considers what lessons the UK's struggling Labour party might learn. Mamdani's success is attributed to a sharp focus on economic issues like housing affordability, championing clear and compelling policies such as free bus transport, and crafting a strong narrative that picks a side against the wealthy elite. His savvy use of social media to connect with voters is contrasted with Labour's challenges in communicating a coherent vision and connecting with the public's primary concerns.</p>

The complex surgery was conducted as explosions shook the hospital, ultimately saving Kira's life and offering her a chance at recovery after years of severe heart problems.</p>

The contents have intensified calls for transparency, particularly regarding Trump's failure to release all documents related to Epstein despite campaign promises to do so.
