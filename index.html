          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following a report indicating a significant slowdown in private sector job growth. Trump, via Truth Social, insisted that Powell should immediately lower interest rates, arguing that Europe has already done so extensively. The ADP report revealed a substantial miss in job creation, falling far short of expectations and marking the lowest monthly reading in over two years. Trump has repeatedly pressured Powell to cut rates to stimulate economic growth, even suggesting he might fire the Fed chair, though he later walked back this threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government, under its new conservative-led coalition, is exploring a streamlined process to designate countries as safe origins to curb asylum seeker numbers. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet has approved a draft policy that would allow such declarations via a simple statutory order, removing the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt framed this as a key component of a broader strategy to overhaul asylum procedures. However, opposition parties and NGOs have criticized the draft, citing concerns about its compatibility with German law and potential impact on asylum seekers' rights.</p>

          <p>Increased investor demand for the Swiss franc, considered a safe haven asset, is causing deflationary pressures in Switzerland. The franc has appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, making imports cheaper and contributing to negative inflation in May. This deflationary trend could push the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to reintroduce negative interest rates and intervene in currency markets to combat the franc's appreciation. Economists predict the SNB may cut its key interest rate further, potentially returning to negative territory before the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, has resigned from her role overseeing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. This decision follows an order from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to update the agency's guidance, a move that Panagiotakopoulos felt compromised her ability to help vulnerable populations. Kennedy's directive included excluding pregnant women from the vaccine recommendations, which contradicted expert advice on the risks of severe COVID-19 in this group. The resignation highlights concerns about political interference in public health decisions and the integrity of the CDC's vaccine guidance process.</p>

          <p>Executives at major corporations, including Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi, have voiced concerns about the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. The on-again, off-again approach to tariffs has prompted some companies to put hiring and investment plans on hold. A survey of CEO confidence fell to its lowest level since 2022, with more than half expecting conditions to worsen over the next six months. The uncertainty puts businesses in a bind because they cannot evaluate the costs and benefits of important long-term decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that following the MIND diet, a blend of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The research, conducted by the University of Hawaii at Manoa, found that people aged 45 to 75 who adhered to the MIND diet were less likely to develop these conditions. The diet emphasizes leafy greens, berries, nuts, olive oil, and other brain-friendly foods. The focus is on building healthy habits over time and reducing consumption of processed snacks, sugary drinks, and alcohol.</p>

          <p>A report by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has criticized train companies for unfairly penalizing passengers for minor ticketing errors. The ORR found that Britain's fare system is overly complex and that rail firms are taking disproportionate action against travelers. The inquiry was launched after numerous passengers were prosecuted over small amounts of money, often due to genuine mistakes. The report recommends that rail firms should stop criminalizing innocent errors and adopt a more reasonable approach to fare enforcement.</p>
