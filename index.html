          <p>Geely Auto, China's second-largest carmaker, announced it will cease building new car plants due to significant global overcapacity, as stated by Chairman Li Shufu at the Chongqing Auto Show. This decision reflects the intense price war in the Chinese automotive market, where companies like BYD and Leapmotor have slashed prices to maintain market share. Geely will instead focus on enhancing its technological capabilities to become a key player in the future of mobility, amidst concerns that most Chinese companies are struggling to maintain profitability. The move signals a strategic shift towards improving existing resources rather than expanding production capacity. </p>

          <p>Australian all-rounder Beau Webster discussed his journey from a part-time off-spinner to a seam-bowling all-rounder, a transition that significantly impacted his cricket career.

He recounts overcoming skepticism from teammates like Usman Khawaja, who initially viewed his pace bowling as a gimmick.

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of 34.5% in May, marking the steepest drop since February 2020, due to ongoing trade tensions and tariffs.

This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Chinese officials are expected to meet with U.S. trade representatives in London for renewed trade talks, as markets watch for potential further monetary easing measures from Beijing.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting citizens from twelve countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, from entering the U.S., has gone into effect. This ban is broader than the initial 2017 ban and includes countries like Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Haiti, while also imposing heightened restrictions on Venezuela. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and targets non-white countries, sowing division and vilifying communities seeking safety and opportunity. The announcement of the ban has been overshadowed by protests in Los Angeles over Trump's deportation raids. </p>

          <p>India's $80 billion investment in coal-fired power plants is running into water scarcity issues, with many new projects planned for the country's driest regions. Access to land, often prioritized over water availability, is a key factor in plant locations. This expansion is likely to lead to conflicts between industry and residents over limited water resources, especially in areas like Solapur and Chandrapur. Despite efforts to reduce reliance on coal, it remains a dominant energy source, posing challenges for water management and sustainability. </p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it an abuse of power based on false pretenses. The board argues that the deployment, made without the request of state leaders, is likely to escalate tensions and create chaos. Trump invoked a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, claiming a rebellion against the government, which the board disputes. The board notes that the last time such authority was used over a governor's objections was during the desegregation of the University of Alabama in 1963. </p>
