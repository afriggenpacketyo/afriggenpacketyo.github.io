          <p>CNBC's Make It Book Club will feature "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki in June. The book addresses whether it is foolish to believe people are fundamentally decent, arguing that optimism is supported by science and leads to better outcomes. Zaki suggests a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned by anyone, with research indicating that cynics are often unhealthier, sadder, poorer, and more often incorrect. The book is positioned as particularly relevant for these complicated times, marked by division and distrust. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is maintaining a wait-and-see approach to interest rate cuts due to significant uncertainty in the economic outlook, according to minutes from their recent meeting. Officials expressed concern about the impacts of President Trump's policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, on inflation and economic growth. The minutes revealed discussions about potential trade-offs between controlling inflation and protecting the labor market, with some officials fearing rising inflation expectations. The Fed staff also warned of a possible recession, complicating the decision-making process, and thus the Fed has set a high bar for rate cuts: clear evidence that the economy is weakening.

          <p>President Trump has pardoned reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of bank and tax fraud in 2022. The couple, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," had been serving prison sentences since 2022. Their pardon comes after they alleged serious government misconduct, including an illegal raid and false testimony. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, thanking Trump for standing up against political prosecutions, and their lawyer argued they were targeted for their conservative views.</p>

          <p>The reality comedy "Duck Dynasty" is returning to A&E, mirroring a sense of restoration similar to the political landscape. The show, focused on the Robertson family and their duck-call business, gained popularity by representing traditionalist, Christian, and rural lifestyles often absent from mainstream pop culture. The revival attempts to recapture the original fun while also acknowledging how fame has changed the family and the potential for a new generation to lead the brand. The original series ended in 2017, but the new show highlights themes of generational change, family, and faith, with some cast members having publicly supported Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed reservations about the size of a Boeing 747-8 gifted by the government of Qatar to replace Air Force One, despite initially accepting the offer.

The original offer from Qatar drew criticism from both parties, with some calling it "the definition of corruption."

          <p>Homeland Security agents are conducting unannounced "wellness checks" on unaccompanied migrant children across the United States, raising concerns among immigrants, educators, and advocates.

Critics argue that these visits are a tactic to accelerate deportations, while the Trump administration claims they are necessary to protect children from exploitation.

Unlike some competitors, Porsche manufactures its vehicles exclusively in Germany, making it more vulnerable to these trade pressures.

          <p>A two-ton elephant seal wandered into a residential area in Gordon's Bay, South Africa, surprising residents and prompting a rescue operation. Police and a local security company contained the seal, while animal welfare officials worried about his distance from the ocean. The seal, estimated to weigh around two tons, was eventually sedated and transported back to his natural habitat. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA highlighted the coordination required to ensure the safety of everyone involved during the incident.</p>

Canada's defense minister echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need to boost defense capacity amid growing global threats. The government's agenda includes strengthening defense relationships with European allies and potentially joining Trump's Golden Dome missile defense system, though the latter is contingent on certain conditions.</p>

          <p>A former surgeon who pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 299 people, mostly children, was sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison by a French court. The trial revealed large cracks in the legal and health administrative bureaucracies that failed to take seriously one clear warning sign. Many of the victims felt the trial of Mr. Le Scouarnec was drowned out by that chorus and did not prompt the public outcry and political responses they had hoped for. The crimes were discovered during a police search of Mr. Le Scouarnec‚Äôs home, after he exposed himself to a 6-year-old girl living next door and her parents reported him.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Cats Distinguish Owner's Scent from Stranger's</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 14:11:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that domestic cats can differentiate between the scent of their owner and that of a stranger. Researchers at Tokyo University of Agriculture found that cats spent significantly longer sniffing tubes containing the odors of unknown people compared to those of their owner. This indicates cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odor, although it is unclear if they can identify specific people. Previous studies have shown cats recognize voices and interpret gazes.</p>
