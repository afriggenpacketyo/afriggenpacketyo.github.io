          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu are scheduled to meet at the White House to discuss the ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza and the newly announced U.S. tariffs.

The leaders are also expected to address Israeli-Turkish relations, the Iranian threat, and the International Criminal Court.

His attention to detail, individual coaching, and tactical acumen have been praised by players, contributing to the club's improved performance and a strong vision for the future.

          <p>An article explores the trend of highly optimized morning routines promoted by fitness influencers, questioning whether they represent a healthy pursuit of vitality or a form of toxic masculinity. The author examines the viral routine of fitness influencer Ashton Hall, noting its rigidity and the subservient role of women in the video. The piece argues that while seemingly benign, such content can promote regressive ideas about masculinity and reinforce patriarchal norms. It suggests that these subtle influences can be more dangerous than overtly misogynistic content.</p>

          <h2>Economists Question Trump's Tariff Formula, Cite Inflation of Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 14:41:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are challenging the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it inflates the rates. They say the formula is based on flawed assumptions about the elasticity of import prices. By adjusting these assumptions, the economists suggest that the tariff rates would be significantly lower. The Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used by the Trump administration are higher than actual rates. These criticisms raise concerns about the accuracy and justification of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Luis Enrique has successfully transformed Paris St-Germain by instilling a philosophy focused on team structure and positional discipline. Initially hesitant about the job due to the club's emphasis on individual stars, Enrique prioritized building a cohesive team. He enforced defensive responsibilities on even star players like Mbappe and prioritized structure over individual brilliance. Enrique's approach involved direct engagement with players and a commitment to his footballing beliefs, leading to PSG's title win.</p>

          <p>With President Trump's tariffs expected to increase prices, some U.S. consumers are stocking up on goods. However, experts advise against going into debt to beat the tariffs, urging consumers to buy only what they can afford. While stocking up may make sense for some items, experts caution against panic buying and emphasize the importance of long-term financial planning. The supply chain is currently in better shape than during the pandemic, minimizing the risk of widespread shortages.</p>
