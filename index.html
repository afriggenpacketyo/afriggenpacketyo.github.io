          <p>Australia's women's cricket team, led by captain Alyssa Healy, secured a remarkable victory against India in the World Cup by successfully chasing a record-breaking target. India set a formidable total of 330 runs, the highest ever conceded by Australia in a one-day international, powered by a strong opening partnership. In response, Healy delivered a masterful performance, scoring 142 runs off 107 balls to anchor the chase. Despite a late-game rally from India's bowlers, Australia reached the target with six balls to spare, marking the highest successful run chase in women's ODI history.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has responded defiantly to new US tariff threats, stating that while Beijing does not want a trade war, it is not afraid of one. The statement came after the US promised 100% tariffs on certain imports in retaliation for China's new export controls on rare earth minerals. Beijing defended its controls as legitimate and accused the U.S. of employing a "textbook double standard" by abusing the concept of national security for its own protectionist measures. The escalating tensions have shaken global markets and cast uncertainty over a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated that despite rhetoric, the White House has not taken sufficient action to counter Russia, noting that bipartisan sanctions bills have stalled. Himes also raised serious legal concerns about recent US lethal strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels near Venezuela, labeling them as potentially "illegal killings" that lack clear legal authority or congressional oversight. Additionally, he discussed the ongoing government shutdown, highlighting the financial strain on military families in his home state of Connecticut.</p>

          <h2>Expert Outlines Seven Practices to Avoid for Raising Mentally Strong Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 13:32:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To cultivate mental strength in children, parents should avoid certain common behaviors that can inadvertently create weakness. According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families, these practices include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, and silencing their big emotions. Instead, parents are encouraged to let children face age-appropriate challenges, take responsibility for their own mistakes, and validate their feelings to build resilience. The article emphasizes that fostering autonomy, avoiding making children responsible for parental emotions, and teaching the value of rest are also crucial for developing emotionally healthy and self-reliant individuals.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts Pro Bowl cornerback Charvarius Ward was ruled out of Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals after suffering a concussion during pre-game warmups. The injury occurred when Ward unexpectedly collided with his teammate, tight end Drew Ogletree. Medical staff attended to him on the field before he was diagnosed and removed from play. This incident marked the second unusual pre-game injury for the Colts, as quarterback Anthony Richardson was also sidelined by an eye injury from a broken workout band. Ward is in his first season with the Colts after successful tenures with the 49ers and Chiefs.</p>

          <p>Several women are taking Meta to task over its advertising algorithms, which continued to target them with baby and pregnancy-related ads after they experienced miscarriages or stillbirths. The constant, painful reminders caused significant emotional distress, forcing some to leave social media platforms. While Meta offers settings to opt out of topics like "parenting," users report these controls are ineffective and do not specifically address pregnancy. The article highlights a recent lawsuit that forced Meta to stop using one user's personal data for direct marketing, but the broader issue remains unresolved for many, raising questions about the company's ethical responsibilities.</p>

          <p>As a ceasefire with Israel takes hold, Hamas is visibly reasserting its control in parts of Gaza, with its internal security forces appearing on the streets and reportedly apprehending alleged collaborators. The group has announced a campaign to arrest individuals accused of spying for Israel, while also engaging in clashes with rival clans challenging its authority. This resurgence of Hamas's power highlights the unresolved question of who will manage security in the territory long-term. The US-brokered peace plan calls for Hamas to be disarmed and replaced by an international stabilization force, but the implementation of such a transition remains a major logistical and political challenge.</p>

          <p>Forty years after Palestinian American activist Alex Odeh was killed by a pipe bomb at his Santa Ana office, his murder remains unsolved, serving as a painful reminder of the threats faced by the Arab American community. Odeh was the West Coast director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee when he was assassinated in 1985. For many, his case symbolizes both the dangers of activism and a call for resilience, with his name recently invoked by student protesters. The FBI investigation is still open, with a $1 million reward offered for information, but for Odeh's family and community, the long wait for justice continues.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir and interview, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on his career and expresses concern about the current state of the nation's highest court. Kennedy, who served for 30 years and was often the pivotal "swing vote," stated that he finds some of the court's recent opinions "a little bit too personal and confrontational." He defended his landmark decisions on abortion rights and same-sex marriage, some of which have since been challenged or overturned by the current conservative majority. Kennedy emphasized the importance of civility and reasoned discussion in public life, warning that its absence puts democracy in danger.</p>

Skye Mountain Rescue Team, along with search dogs and assistance from other rescue services, conducted extensive searches over two days in challenging terrain and poor visibility, but have so far been unsuccessful in locating him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deployment of Border Patrol agents in major US cities far from the border is raising concerns among legal experts and human rights advocates about the agency's aggressive enforcement tactics. Traditionally focused on rural border areas, agents are now a visible part of the administration's urban immigration raids, leading to violent confrontations in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. Critics argue that these agents are not trained for community policing and may be misapplying their broader search-and-seizure authorities, which are typically limited to a 100-mile zone from any international boundary. This expansion of their role is seen as a force multiplier for the administration's mass deportation goals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Harvard Business Review study indicates that artificial intelligence tools are contributing to a rise in "workslop," defined as AI-generated content that appears complete but lacks real substance. Over 40% of surveyed employees reported receiving such low-quality work, which is reportedly harming overall productivity. The article argues that while the technology itself is imperfect, the primary responsibility for this issue lies with employers. It suggests that failures in implementation, such as a lack of proper training, clear policies, and defined metrics for success, are the root cause, rather than the AI tools themselves.
