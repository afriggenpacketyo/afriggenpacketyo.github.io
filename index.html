          <p>Following days of clashes between law enforcement and protesters in Los Angeles sparked by immigration enforcement operations, President Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard. The move was criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who called it an inflammatory escalation. Protests continued for a third day, with demonstrators blocking freeways and vandalizing vehicles, leading to multiple arrests and injuries to law enforcement officers. The unrest follows a large-scale ICE operation in the city that resulted in numerous arrests, including a domestic abuser and a child rapist, according to ICE. The deployment was also criticized by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who called it a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. Optimism score must be considered in light of the violent context.</p>

          <p>The UK government has proposed expanding the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, to cover a larger area of its offshore Marine Protected Areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal, which follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling, would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2, covering 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs. A 12-week consultation will seek input from the marine and fishing industry.</p>

          <p>China is heavily involved in the construction, operation, and maintenance of Egypt’s New Administrative Capital, a city designed to house over 6 million people and alleviate congestion in Cairo. China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) is the primary contractor for the central business district, including Africa's tallest skyscraper, and has signed a protocol to operate and maintain the CBD. This partnership cements Chinese companies as key players in Egypt’s infrastructure development and positions Cairo as a gateway for China's Belt and Road Initiative into Africa and the Middle East. The new capital has served as Egypt's official seat of government since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's third-term inauguration.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in May, marking the sharpest decline in more than five years, while overall exports growth missed expectations. The decrease is attributed to the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S., though a trade truce was reached mid-month. Imports from the U.S. also fell, and China's trade surplus with America shrank considerably. Despite the decline in exports to the U.S., China saw increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa.</p>

          <p>A contractor in Syria discovered an ancient Byzantine tomb complex while clearing rubble in Maarat al-Numan, Idlib province. The tomb, believed to be over 1,500 years old, contains two burial chambers with stone tombs, and features a cross etched into a column. The discovery adds to the rich collection of archeological sites in Idlib, which has suffered significant damage during the Syrian civil war. Residents hope the discovery will lead to economic renewal through tourism.</p>

          <p>The deployment of federal agents and the National Guard in Los Angeles, following immigration raids and protests, has raised concerns about the emergence of a police state. Critics argue that Trump's actions, including declaring an emergency and using militarized agents against civilians, are eroding civil liberties. The situation has prompted fears that the infrastructure of a police state could be turned against anyone, leading to further escalations and division. Peaceful protests and the federal courts are seen as key bulwarks against this perceived authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Two Russian human rights experts, now living abroad, observe worrying similarities between America's current political climate and Russia's slide into authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin. They use Russian terms to describe phenomena such as the manipulation of media, the creation of master plans to justify actions, and the suppression of dissent. This analysis aims to provide Americans with a new vocabulary to understand and combat these emerging authoritarian trends.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting citizens from a dozen countries, mainly in Africa and the Middle East, went into effect. The proclamation restricts nationals from several countries from entering the U.S., while partially restricting others.

Critics argue that the ban disproportionately affects African countries and is rooted in bigotry, while the administration claims it addresses national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A New Orleans police officer, Derrick Burmaster, will face a jury trial in a federal lawsuit for fatally shooting a puppy.
