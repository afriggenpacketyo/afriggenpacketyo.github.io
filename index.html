          <p>With overall mortgage demand weakening despite slightly lower interest rates, homebuyers are increasingly turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to find savings. The share of ARM applications rose as they offer interest rates nearly a percentage point below 30-year fixed rates. This trend highlights the financial pressure on buyers contending with high home prices and economic uncertainty, pushing them toward loans with potential future rate volatility. The market remains tense as both purchase and refinance applications have seen recent declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A legal expert has provided insight into the defense strategy for Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the murder of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The defense will likely focus on maintaining evidence confidentiality to ensure a fair trial and may challenge the aggravating factors to reduce the charge from capital homicide to murder. Potential strategies also include questioning the legality of evidence collection and preparing a mitigation defense to humanize the defendant by highlighting past trauma or mental health issues. The high-profile nature of the case necessitates careful management of public perception from the outset.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry, the tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is currently churning over the central Atlantic and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. While far from the U.S. mainland, its projected path will bring it near the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches for several Caribbean islands. Forecasters predict the storm will bring heavy rainfall, risking flash floods, as well as life-threatening surf and rip currents to the region. The season has been relatively quiet otherwise, with few storms making landfall in the U.S. so far.</p>

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has resulted in the deaths of at least 24 people and injured 47 others during a peaceful protest at a Buddhist festival. The army used a motorized paraglider to drop two bombs on a crowd gathered in the Sagaing region to protest military conscription and call for the release of political prisoners. This incident is part of a broader, bloody campaign of airstrikes by the junta, which has recently been bolstered by new drone technology from China and assistance from Russia. The attack highlights the military's escalating violence against civilians amid the country's ongoing civil war.</p>

Gabriel Attal, once a protégé, stated he no longer understands the president's decisions, while Edouard Philippe called for an early presidential election to resolve the deadlock. In a significant move, former Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne suggested suspending Macron's controversial pension reform, a cornerstone of his legacy, as a potential path to negotiation.

Occupations in technology and finance that rely on cognitive reasoning are most at risk, while roles requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, such as nursing and construction, are more insulated. Experts note that while AI's potential to disrupt is significant, its current impact is more about augmenting human capabilities rather than outright replacing jobs. The technology is still flawed, and most businesses have yet to fully integrate it, leading to a hybrid model where human oversight remains essential.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has issued a warning that global financial markets face an increased risk of a "sharp correction." The potential triggers identified include a souring of investor sentiment toward artificial intelligence or a decline in the perceived independence and credibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The report noted that U.S. stock market valuations, heavily concentrated in a few large tech companies, are stretched to levels reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. Any significant shift in expectations could lead to a market slump with material spillover effects on Britain's financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Xiaomi's founder and CEO, Lei Jun, announced that the initial sales for the company's new 17-series smartphones have "exceeded expectations." Launched just two weeks after Apple's iPhone 17, the new flagship device is part of Xiaomi's strategy to compete more aggressively in the premium smartphone market against rivals like Apple and Huawei. The company reported selling over one million units in the first week, surpassing the performance of its previous series. The strong early demand has reportedly led to stock shortages, reflecting growing consumer confidence in the brand's high-end offerings.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a key political meeting, China's official Communist Party newspaper has published a series of op-eds describing the nation's economy as an "unsinkable economic aircraft carrier." The articles aim to project an image of strength and stability, capable of withstanding both internal and external pressures like trade protectionism. The commentary contrasts China's consistent long-term planning with what it calls the wavering and self-isolating policies of some Western countries. This messaging emphasizes confidence in China's ongoing economic transformation towards innovation-driven and greener growth, framing its future as "fully predictable."</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a mathematics professor diagnosed with autism in adulthood reflects on the challenges and strengths that come with being neurodivergent. The author argues against the narrative that autism is a tragedy to be eliminated, drawing parallels to the eugenics movement and the pushback from the Deaf community. The article emphasizes that autistic traits like persistence, pattern recognition, and focus are valuable assets, particularly in fields like science and mathematics, citing historical figures like Isaac Newton. The piece is a call for inclusion and a reframing of disability, insisting that the world is a better place when people think differently.</p>

          <p>George Legere, a 77-year-old man charged last month with a 1973 murder, has died in a Connecticut prison. Legere was found unresponsive in his cell while already serving a 25-year sentence for a separate cold case involving kidnapping and sexual assault. He had recently confessed to the 1973 stabbing death of 21-year-old Janet Couture, stating he was trying to steal money for drugs when she woke up and recognized him. His confession followed information from another inmate, to whom Legere had provided a written account of the murder to be released after his death.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has urged Europe to bolster its defenses against what she terms "hybrid warfare." Citing a pattern of air incursions, cyberattacks, and damage to undersea cables, she stated these are not random incidents but a deliberate campaign to destabilize the region and weaken support for Ukraine. While not explicitly blaming Russia for every incident, she identified Moscow's aim as sowing division within Europe. The call to action comes as the EU plans joint defense projects, including anti-drone systems, to prepare for potential future threats.</p>

          <p>The team behind the Planet Money podcast explains why preordering a book is so crucial for authors and publishers, using their own upcoming book as an example. Strong preorder numbers serve as a key predictor of success, influencing booksellers' decisions on stocking levels and in-store promotion. All preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases the chances of a book debuting on a bestseller list, creating a snowball effect of visibility and further sales. This inside look at the book business reveals how early consumer support can be a powerful force in determining a book's ultimate success.</p>

The charges stem from his 2020 testimony to Congress regarding his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. Prosecutors allege he misled the Senate about authorizing leaks to the media, a claim that came under scrutiny after a 2018 Inspector General report. The indictment followed public pressure from President Donald Trump, raising concerns among critics about the politicization of the Justice Department and its independence.</p>

These are highly porous, crystalline materials constructed from metal ions linked by organic molecules, creating vast internal surface areas. The Nobel committee highlighted the immense potential of MOFs, which can be used for a wide range of applications, including capturing carbon dioxide, storing toxic gases, and even harvesting water from desert air. Their research has created a new field of chemistry, enabling the design of custom-made materials with novel and highly useful functions.</p>
