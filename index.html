            <p>President Trump underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed, his first since starting his second term, amidst scrutiny regarding his health and fitness for office, especially given his age of 78, making him the oldest president to be sworn in. The White House promised transparency, with Trump's physician expected to release an update on the report, providing as many results as possible. The public has not been provided a detailed look into Trump's health since 2018, and he did not provide any details during the 2024 presidential campaign, despite promising to do so. In 2024, Trump was shot in the ear at a rally and treated for a "Gunshot Wound to the Right Ear," according to GOP Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, who reviewed Trump's medical records from Butler Memorial Hospital.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Tariffs: A Bargaining Chip for a New Global Economic Order?</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 14:30:33 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Stephen Miran, a top economic advisor to President Trump, hinted at a potential White House effort to establish a new global economic order beyond tariffs, suggesting a reform of the international economic system akin to Bretton Woods, possibly dubbed "The Mar-A-Lago Accord." Miran has argued that the dollar's role as the international reserve currency, while beneficial, also strengthens the dollar, making American exports less competitive. Some observers believe Trump's aggressive tariff policy is aimed at strengthening the U.S.'s hand in negotiations for a grand bargain that serves America's economy. UC Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen dismisses these arguments as nonsense, stating that the dollar's role is a minor factor compared to productivity, wages, and innovation.

            <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing Garcia back, but suggested the lower court may have exceeded its authority. Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error," though the government alleges he is an MS-13 gang member, which his lawyer denies. The Supreme Court decision requires the Trump administration to assist in Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and ensure his case is handled as if he hadn't been improperly deported.</p>

            <p>General Motors is reducing production of its BrightDrop electric delivery vans at its CAMI plant in Ontario, Canada, leading to a prolonged shutdown and the elimination of 500 jobs.

The plant will shift from two shifts to one, with a 20-week idling period starting next month. Unifor, the Canadian union representing the workers, expressed disappointment and called for government support to mitigate job losses.</p>

            <p>Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava's absence from spring practice was reportedly due to disagreements over his NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) contract. Iamaleava, who is reportedly set to earn $2.4 million this season, is seeking to renegotiate his deal to $4 million per year. The quarterback, a highly-rated recruit, initially signed with Tennessee's NIL collective in 2022, with a projected $8 million payout over his college career.

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has surged above 4.5% following President Trump's trade actions, causing concern on Wall Street and within the White House. This rise in yields, which move inversely to bond prices, reflects investors dumping U.S. assets amid heightened trade tensions with China and other nations. The increase has complicated the White House's trade approach, with officials acknowledging the bond market's influence on policy decisions. Analysts suggest the administration's focus on low financing costs makes rising Treasury yields a significant concern.</p>

            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is taking a hard line in the trade war with President Trump, signaling that China is prepared to withstand economic pain and stand up to what it views as American "bullying." Xi's strategy involves reducing China's reliance on the United States by expanding trade relations with other countries. Experts suggest that Xi believes China can weather the damage and that the United States will ultimately be the one to concede. China could also retaliate by restricting exports of critical materials and limiting Hollywood films in China.</p>

            <p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav's compensation increased to nearly $52 million, despite the company facing struggles throughout 2024. The lofty compensation plan maintains Zaslav's standing as one of the most handsomely paid executives in America, ahead of his Hollywood counterparts. Cable television pioneer John Malone will step down as a voting member of the board and take on a newly created position of Chair Emeritus. Warner Bros. Discovery has attracted interest from activist shareholders as the company’s stock languishes amid Wall Street’s recognition of the diminishing prospects for basic cable channels.</p>

            <p>President Trump is urging trade partners to buy more U.S. energy as a way to avoid higher tariffs. Trump paused "reciprocal" tariffs on countries except China, and is demanding that the European Union buy $350 billion of American energy to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. The U.S. is the largest oil and gas producer in the world and is the third-largest crude exporter and the largest liquefied natural gas exporter in the world. LNG is "the commodity where there's room for countries to increase their energy imports from the US,"</p>

            <p>President Trump insists that his trade war is "doing really well" despite growing fears of a recession and China's retaliatory tariff hikes. The White House claims the U.S. economy is on the cusp of a "golden age," while dozens of countries are scrambling to make deals to avoid higher tariffs. However, an economic survey revealed that U.S. consumer expectations for price growth have soared to a four-decade high. Some Wall Street figures are unconvinced, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggesting the U.S. is already in a recession.</p>

            <p>Analysts estimate that an iPhone 16 Pro, which is currently priced at $1,199, could increase 25% based on labor costs alone if it were made in the USA. That would make it a roughly $1,500 device. As it's largely a theoretical exercise, there's a broad range of guesses as to how much an all-American iPhone might cost. Apple makes more than 80% of its products in China and a "Made in the USA" iPhone would face serious challenges, ranging from finding and paying a U.S. workforce to tariff costs that Apple would incur importing parts to the U.S. for final assembly.</p>

            <p>China's decision to increase tariffs on U.S. products to 125% has led to a mixed reaction in the stock market. Stocks initially wobbled before gaining momentum, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all rising. The move is seen as a response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, with some analysts raising concerns about the impact on corporate profits and the broader economy. Investors are also flocking to safe havens like gold, which rose more than 2% following China's tariff hike. (not investment advice)</p>
