          <p>The Department of Justice has assigned two out-of-state assistant U.S. attorneys to the case against former FBI Director James Comey, ahead of his arraignment in Virginia. Comey was indicted last month by a grand jury, which heard evidence from Lindsey Halligan, President Trump's appointee as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The charges against Comey, which he denies, relate to making a false statement and obstruction concerning his 2020 Senate testimony on the FBI's Russia investigation. This development follows President Trump's public demands for prosecution against Comey and other political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Federal employees are experiencing severe financial strain as the government shutdown extends into its second week, forcing many to consider drastic measures like garage sales and dipping into savings. Imelda Avila-Thomas, a Department of Labor employee, described the situation as a "double whammy" for her household, highlighting the "desperation and uncertainty" among 750,000 furloughed workers. While backpay is usually expected, President Trump hinted at potentially denying it for some, intensifying concerns. The impasse continues to squeeze family budgets, with workers resorting to cheaper food options and cutting expenses.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming fourth plenum is anticipated to witness the highest turnover of Central Committee members in eight years, driven by ongoing corruption investigations and some officials' deaths. This meeting, scheduled for October 20-23 in Beijing, will focus on outlining the nation's next five-year plan. The current committee, formed in 2022, has already seen replacements, including former foreign minister Qin Gang, whose resignation was accepted under circumstances suggesting a criminal investigation.

          <p>An analysis investigates whether Donald Trump's 2024 winning coalition is eroding amidst his first year in office, marked by various controversial policies and clashes. While some slippage in support is noted, particularly among Hispanic/Latino Americans and young people, the article suggests it's not a complete collapse. A majority of Republicans and conservatives remain supportive, but economic perceptions pose the biggest risk to this alliance. The article concludes that many voters in Trump's coalition were driven by dissatisfaction with the status quo, and their continued economic unease could shift their allegiance in future elections.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is advocating for a significant expansion of export controls on chip manufacturing equipment to China and greater alignment from international allies. Congressman John Moolenaar emphasized that "countrywide technology controls are the only way" to limit Chinese semiconductor advancement, stressing the need for synchronized restrictions with partners like the Netherlands and Japan. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party's report argues that existing restrictions are insufficient, as Chinese entities can still cooperate to evade U.S. controls. This push reflects growing concerns over national security and technological competition with China.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is examining a Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, raising questions about free speech versus professional conduct. Kaley Chiles, a Christian counselor, argues the law unconstitutionally restricts her ability to discuss gender dysphoria and sexual orientation with young patients. Colorado maintains the law regulates medical treatments deemed unsafe and ineffective, not speech, to protect vulnerable minors. Justices expressed skepticism about the state's interpretation, with concerns raised about potential viewpoint discrimination if certain therapeutic approaches are permitted while others are banned.

          <p>U.S. airports, including Denver, Newark, and Burbank, experienced significant flight delays due to ongoing shortages of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by the government shutdown.

          <p>An opinion piece challenges Donald Trump's portrayal of Portland as a "war zone" or "battlefield," arguing that the reality on the ground is a small, mostly peaceful protest against federal actions. The author, a former CNN journalist, describes the scene as more satirical than violent, with federal deployments appearing as a "spectacle" to manufacture a narrative of chaos. The article critiques Trump's use of militarized optics to frame critics as insurgents, drawing parallels to authoritarian tactics used globally. It raises concerns about the erosion of democratic principles and the potential for the military to be used against citizens.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that inhalers for asthma and COPD generated an estimated 24.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in the U.S. from 2014-2024, comparable to over 530,000 gas-powered cars annually. Metered-dose inhalers, which use potent hydrofluoroalkane propellants, are the primary contributors. Researchers emphasize that these emissions worsen global warming, potentially exacerbating the very respiratory conditions they treat. The article highlights a significant opportunity to mitigate this environmental impact by utilizing lower-emission alternatives, such as dry powder or soft mist inhalers.</p>

She refused to discuss an alleged bribery scheme or her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, often resorting to personal attacks against her questioners. Democrats expressed dismay at the lack of answers, accusing Bondi of weaponizing the Justice Department to protect President Trump and target his political adversaries. Bondi, however, defended her focus on combating illegal immigration and violent crime.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has expressed disinterest in Bad Bunny's upcoming Super Bowl LX halftime performance, claiming he has "never heard of him" and criticizing the choice. Newsmax host Greg Kelly prompted Trump by noting Bad Bunny's anti-ICE stance and accusations of racism. Trump dismissed the selection as "crazy" and "absolutely ridiculous," despite the artist's global fame. This follows Bad Bunny's previous concerns about ICE enforcement impacting his U.S. concert dates and recent right-wing backlash to his Super Bowl gig. The artist, in turn, highlighted the performance as a win for all Latinos, asserting their indelible contribution to the country.</p>

          <p>Illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border have plummeted to their lowest level in over 50 years, with federal data indicating fewer than 9,000 apprehensions per month during Donald Trump's first eight months in office. This marks a significant decrease from the 238,000 migrant stops in fiscal year 2025, which included four months of the previous administration. The White House credits Trump's executive orders, including increased troop deployment, an end to asylum requests, and expanded ICE powers, for this "progress on border security."

          <p>Los Angeles residents are set to experience a dramatic increase in trash collection fees after the City Council finalized a rate hike, effective mid-November. The decision addresses a long-standing subsidy of approximately $500,000 daily, which contributed to the city's nearly $1-billion budget deficit. Fees for single-family homes and smaller apartments will more than double, with additional increases planned over four years. This move, prompted by rising operational costs and a 17-year freeze on fees, aims to bring charges in line with actual service costs, though it will add to residents' already soaring cost of living.</p>
