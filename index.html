          <p>Renowned author Sir Philip Pullman has strongly criticized the practice of using writers' books to train artificial intelligence (AI) software without providing compensation or recognition, labeling it a "wicked system." He argues this "scraping" amounts to theft, potentially destroying growth in creative fields, and urges the UK government to immediately change copyright laws. Pullman believes authors deserve payment for their intellectual property, likening the indiscriminate data collection to a trawler killing everything at sea. His call comes as the government has launched a consultation and established expert working groups on AI and copyright, highlighting the urgent need for legal reform to protect creative industries in the evolving digital landscape.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly declined Wednesday as investors assessed Japan's trade data and new political leadership. While Japanese exports rose 4.2% year-on-year in September, ending a four-month decline, and saw robust growth to Asia, overall figures missed analyst expectations. SoftBank shares notably plunged over 5% amid this regional market activity. The context includes the recent swearing-in of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her cabinet, with her economic policies anticipated to potentially weaken the yen and benefit exporters, adding a layer of political assessment to the economic indicators.

His unexpected passing was announced by the Charlotte Chess Center, where he served as a coach, though no specific cause of death was provided. The global chess community widely mourns the loss of this talented player, commentator, educator, and cherished member who inspired many.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November to bolster security for upcoming major city events, including the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick confirmed the deployment, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, emphasizing it as a partnership to act as a "force multiplier" for the understaffed police department. Despite a recent New Year's Day terror attack, the city has seen a decrease in crime across most categories compared to last year. This article highlights proactive security measures and collaborative law enforcement efforts to ensure public safety during high-profile gatherings.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has asserted that the national inquiry into sexual assault gangs in England and Wales will maintain its focused scope and not be "watered down." Her statement follows the resignation of three abuse survivors from the inquiry panel, who expressed concerns about potential scope broadening and the suitability of chairperson candidates. Mahmood also confirmed the inquiry would explicitly examine the ethnicity and religion of offenders. Despite survivor frustration over delays and fears of a "cover-up," the government insists its commitment remains to a laser-focused investigation. This article highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing historical abuse and ensuring victim trust in official processes.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with a surge in copper wire theft, plunging many communities into darkness and incurring millions in repair costs, as exemplified by the unlit Sixth Street Bridge. This widespread issue, contributing to over half of streetlight outages, poses significant safety concerns, with one district attorney linking it to a fatal shooting. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, increasing accountability for junk dealers and penalties for purchasing stolen public materials. The city is also exploring solar lighting as a preventative measure to mitigate future thefts.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports rebounded in September with a 4.2% year-on-year increase, snapping a four-month decline, largely due to robust growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to tumble by 13.3%, especially in auto shipments, despite a trade deal that lowered tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a significant driver of overall growth. The data emerges as Japan welcomes its first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, whose loose monetary and fiscal policies are expected to weaken the yen and benefit exporters, contributing to market shifts.

          <p>This article analyzes why President Trump achieved a breakthrough in the Gaza ceasefire but struggles to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, attributing the difference to varying levels of leverage. In Gaza, Trump's long-standing pro-Israel stance and political ties to Arab nations provided unique influence over Prime Minister Netanyahu. Conversely, in the Ukraine conflict, Trump's inconsistent approach—swinging between threats and concessions to both Putin and Zelensky—has yielded little effect.

          <p>A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of different antidepressants, revealing significant variations between drugs. The research, analyzing 151 studies of 30 common medications, found some drugs could cause weight changes of up to 2kg or heart rate variations of 21 beats per minute within eight weeks. Academics emphasize these differences are crucial for personalized treatment, calling for antidepressants to be matched more closely to individual patient needs and health conditions.

          <p>UK supermarket prices, exemplified by a 134% rise in orange juice since 2020, have become "sky high" due to a "perfect storm" of factors. This article details how disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on single-nation supply, trade wars, and new packaging regulations have driven up costs. The case of orange juice, affected by citrus greening and droughts in major producing regions like Brazil and Florida, illustrates broader trends impacting staples like beef, butter, and coffee. Experts question if these price hikes are temporary or a permanent shift, suggesting the UK's import dependency makes it vulnerable to future shocks.</p>
