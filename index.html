          <p>Japan and the United States have yet to reach a consensus on tariff issues, according to Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, following talks in Washington. Despite ongoing differences, both countries aim to finalize a mutually beneficial trade agreement by mid-June. Akazawa reiterated Japan's stance that the Trump administration's additional tariffs should be removed promptly due to their adverse impact on the Japanese economy. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump plan to meet around the G7 summit in Canada to discuss the progress.</p>
