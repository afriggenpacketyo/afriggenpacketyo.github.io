          <p>Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who gained prominence after 9/11, has died at the age of 69 after a private battle with illness. Kerik coordinated emergency response efforts after the World Trade Center collapse and was recognized with over 100 awards for his service. However, he later pleaded guilty to eight felonies in 2009, including tax fraud and lying to the White House, serving nearly three years in prison. He was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020 and became a vocal critic of the criminal justice system, also working with Giuliani to investigate election fraud claims after the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Natalie Phelps, a 43-year-old cancer patient, reports delays in her life-saving treatment due to cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented by the Trump administration. Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, is part of a cell-based immunotherapy trial at the NIH, but staff reductions have caused delays in her treatment timeline. Despite HHS statements claiming no cuts to clinical trials, Rosenberg, the doctor leading the trial, confirmed that patients are experiencing delays due to staff cuts and purchasing slowdowns. The delays have caused stress and uncertainty for Phelps, who is advocating for her treatment to start sooner.</p>

          <p>Nathan Laatsch, an IT specialist employed by the Defense Intelligence Agency, was arrested and charged with attempting to provide classified information to a foreign government. The FBI began investigating Laatsch in March after receiving a tip that he offered to provide classified information due to his disagreement with the current administration's values. Laatsch allegedly transcribed classified information into a notepad at his desk and hid it in his socks, intending to deliver it to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign emissary.

          <p>China has revealed the world's first AI nuke inspector, a technology developed by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy. The project aims to bolster China's position in international disarmament talks and involves training the AI using sensitive nuclear data, while ensuring it does not leak tech secrets. This initiative is built on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists, facing hurdles in convincing military leaders and skeptical nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods.

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership due to dissatisfaction with the agency's levels of immigration arrests and deportations. Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, while Robert Hammer, who leads ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, has been reassigned. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff, has stated the administration is pushing ICE to carry out a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day, which would be an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Major USDA cuts are severely impacting food banks and school food programs in North Carolina, with local growers and food banks facing significant losses in funding. The Trump administration's cuts to the Local Food for Schools program and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement have resulted in reduced access to local foods for children and increased strain on food banks. Pine Knot Farms, a local grower, has seen a devastating loss of revenue, while the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina faces a $2 million reduction in aid.

          <p>The federal government will begin revoking the visas of some Chinese international students, including those studying in "critical fields," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday â€” the latest restriction on foreign students. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. blasted the announcement, saying it is "firmly opposed to this politically motivated and discriminatory action," and urged the administration to "immediately correct its mistakes and ensure the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will begin revoking visas of some Chinese international students, particularly those in "critical fields," according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The government will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. has criticized the announcement, calling it a "politically motivated and discriminatory action." This decision follows increasing scrutiny of ties between U.S. higher education and China, with some Republicans pressing universities to cut ties with Chinese institutions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily suspend a lower court ruling that invalidated some of its tariffs. The lower court had ruled that Trump overstepped his power by imposing the duties, but the appeals court's decision allows the tariffs to remain in effect while the case is litigated. White House officials criticized the initial ruling as judicial overreach and stated that the administration will continue to fight for its tariff policies. The next hearing is scheduled for June 5.</p>

A senior UN official has expressed diminished hope that negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will lead to a deal to halt fighting.

Positive sentiment fell from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, with many business travel buyers anticipating reductions in employee trips and spending. Concerns include rising business travel costs and problems processing visas, leading some companies to consider relocating events from the U.S. to other countries.

Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, and compelling valuations along with falling interest rates make diversifying away from U.S. equities more attractive.
