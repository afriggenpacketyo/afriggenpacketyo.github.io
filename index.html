          <p>Following an alleged Israeli missile strike that killed Iranian military leaders, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israeli territory. Rocket sirens sounded in northern Jordan, with reports of interceptions of Iranian drones in Jordanian airspace. The alleged Israeli strike targeted Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, occurring days before scheduled U.S. and Iranian nuclear deal talks. News of the attacks caused oil prices to surge and stock markets to decline as investors sought safe havens, with the U.S. State Department stating it was not involved in the alleged Israeli actions and urging Iran not to target U.S. interests. The optimism score for this event reflects the potential for further escalation and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>The newly elected Mark Carney government in Canada has introduced Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act, which is facing criticism for its potential impact on privacy laws and refugee policies. The bill grants law enforcement greater access to citizens' data and aligns Canada's refugee policies more closely with those of the United States. Critics argue that the bill infringes on due process, disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, and constructs a surveillance state. Concerns have been raised about the bill's potential to undermine privacy rights and erode protections for refugees and immigrants.</p>

          <p>In response to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States, China has been encouraging its exporters to focus on the domestic market. One strategy involves promoting the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, guaranteeing payment for goods or services, with payment periods generally lasting one year. While international L/Cs are limited to physical goods, domestic L/Cs can also be used for trade in services.</p>

          <p>German machinery makers are urging the European Union to implement trade barriers to protect their industry from increasingly strong Chinese competitors. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) has published a position paper calling for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China. The VDMA, representing medium-sized manufacturers, argues that Chinese companies receive heavy government subsidies and sometimes disregard technical regulations, creating unfair competition. The industry group is seeking government intervention to level the playing field.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment from the United States in ongoing tariff negotiations, particularly regarding auto tariffs. Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed optimism that Japan would be treated differently from other countries once a deal is finalized. President Trump has signaled a potential increase in auto import tariffs, which would negatively impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is aiming to make progress in the talks ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and Trump.</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during its initial launch attempt. Leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the event and stated plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. Experts are questioning the completeness of the repairs given the speed of the relaunch. Kim emphasized the importance of developing a nuclear-armed navy and warned that enemies would soon experience the consequences of North Korea's naval power.</p>

          <p>Asian markets opened lower and oil prices surged following reports of an alleged Israeli strike on Iran, reflecting investor concerns over escalating tensions in the Middle East. U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude both experienced significant increases. Despite the initial downturn, analysts anticipate a quick recovery for Asian markets due to their limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties with unaffected countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The previous day, U.S. stock indexes had ticked higher following encouraging inflation data.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel has stated that Israel would continue to attack Iran to eliminate its nuclear program, citing that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble a nuclear weapon. The decision to allegedly strike now was influenced by a shift in Iran's political calculation, as it lost its deterrent power after Israel repeatedly pierced its immunity by attacking Iranian soldiers and proxies. An Iran without a vigorous Axis simply does not have much to bargain or threaten with, and so the only way to recover the lost deference would be to achieve real nuclear statehood.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to tap into its rare earth reserves in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have caused shortages affecting various industries. Experts suggest that India could emerge as a significant alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but this would require substantial public and private investment in the sector. The recent export pause by China has been described as a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative. The country produces roughly 60% of the world's supply of rare earths and processes almost 90%, which includes materials imported from other countries.</p>

He stressed that these digital assets do not represent "any risks or comparison" to gold. His comments came as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies continues to grow, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar.
