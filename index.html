          <p>President Trump has reversed his decision to deploy federal forces to San Francisco after holding conversations with prominent tech executives, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump acknowledged the city's reported progress on crime under Mayor Daniel Lurie and cited calls from influential business leaders as the reason for holding off on the deployment. This move is seen as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has favored a less confrontational approach with the administration while welcoming partnerships with existing federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has officially denied reports that the Trump administration is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. This denial followed a media report that caused the stocks of several quantum companies to rise. The administration has recently taken equity in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, arguing the government should benefit from the success of federally funded companies, but it is not currently pursuing this strategy in the quantum space.</p>

          <p>Hungary's charged political atmosphere was on full display as tens of thousands attended rival rallies in Budapest on the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán framed the upcoming election as a choice between his "peace march" and opponents he labeled "warmongers" over the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, his main challenger, Peter Magyar, led a rally demanding "system change," accusing Orbán of corruption, centralizing power, and fostering overly close ties with the Kremlin, turning Hungary into the EU's poorest and most corrupt member state.</p>

          <p>A federal indictment has revealed allegations that former NBA player Damon Jones leaked confidential injury information about superstar LeBron James to sports bettors. The indictment, which charges Jones with defrauding betting companies, details a text message sent before a February 2023 game in which Jones allegedly told a co-conspirator to place a large bet against the Lakers because James would be out. James, who was Jones's former teammate, is not accused of any wrongdoing, and a person familiar with the situation stated he was unaware his information would be used for betting.</p>

          <p>Three Metropolitan Police officers have been sacked for gross misconduct after being secretly recorded for a BBC Panorama investigation into the Charing Cross police station. One sergeant was filmed being dismissive of a pregnant woman's domestic violence and sexual assault allegation, while two other constables were recorded making racist and violent comments. The panel chair described their conduct as an "utter disgrace" and a cause of "significant harm" to public confidence in policing. Seven more officers are scheduled to face similar expedited misconduct hearings in the coming week.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a full pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Zhao had previously pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations and was sentenced to four months in prison. A White House statement declared the "war on crypto is over," signaling a significant policy shift toward easing scrutiny on the digital asset industry. The pardon has drawn attention due to recent reports of business discussions between Binance and the Trump family's own crypto enterprise, although Zhao has denied any connection.</p>

          <p>Melanie Winter, a tireless advocate who dedicated nearly three decades to transforming the Los Angeles River from a concrete channel back into a natural ecosystem, has died at 67.

Her work resulted in the creation of new parks and innovative neighborhood projects, leaving a lasting legacy and inspiring a new generation to continue the fight for a more sustainable, nature-based urban environment.</p>

The technology works by detecting an image's subject and background, isolating them into separate layers that move independently as the phone is tilted, creating a subtle depth effect. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to activate this feature within the Photos app and how to set these 3D images as a motion-enabled wallpaper on the lock screen for compatible iPhone models.</p>

To mitigate this, many are turning to alternative assets that are uncorrelated with the broader stock market. According to market strategists, ETF flows show a clear trend of investors moving into cash, precious metals like gold, and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. This shift reflects a growing desire to diversify away from heavy tech and AI exposure and protect portfolios from potential market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
