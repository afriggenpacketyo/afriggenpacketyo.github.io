          <p>New York Yankees player Jazz Chisholm Jr. faced significant criticism from announcers and fans for a major baserunning error during a game against the Miami Marlins. In the second inning, Chisholm was caught too far off first base on a pop-up, resulting in an easy inning-ending double play. Despite the backlash, Chisholm defended his decision as an attempt to be aggressive on the basepaths and force a potential mistake from the fielders. The Yankees ultimately lost the game 2-0, managing only two hits.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has accused the Israeli military of a "deliberate" attack on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, which killed one staff member and injured three others. The aid group stated that its building was clearly marked and its location known to the IDF, which shelled the facility multiple times, causing a fire. The Israel Defense Forces has said it is reviewing the claim. This incident has heightened concerns over the safety of humanitarian workers in the conflict zone, with the UN calling for an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian-American man, Khamis Ayyad, has died from smoke inhalation in the West Bank village of Silwad following fires allegedly set by Israeli settlers. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death, condemned the violence, and is providing consular assistance to the family. This event is part of a rising trend of settler attacks in the occupied territory, which have intensified since the October 7th conflict began. Ayyad is the second Palestinian-American to be killed in the West Bank in the past three weeks, prompting calls for investigation and accountability.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore exhibits detailing Donald Trump's two impeachments in the "coming weeks" after their removal sparked public concern. The National Museum for American History removed a temporary placard about the impeachments, citing that it did not meet museum standards for presentation. In a statement, the museum denied that the removal was due to pressure from any administration. The updated presentation will be part of the "Limits of Presidential Power" section, alongside exhibits on the impeachments of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered its August recess without an agreement to advance dozens of Donald Trump's presidential nominees, following days of intense negotiations. Democrats have been systematically blocking quick confirmations, prompting Trump to publicly attack Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. In response to the gridlock, Republicans are considering changing Senate rules to expedite the confirmation process upon their return. The standoff highlights the escalating partisan obstruction over executive and judicial appointments that has characterized recent administrations.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. Set to be JFK's largest terminal, the facility is designed for international travelers and will feature light-filled spaces, 23 wide-body capable gates, and over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining. The project is part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of the airport, aimed at modernizing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic. The new terminal is also designed with its own microgrid for power resiliency.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer explained the administration's tariff strategy, stating that tariffs are set for about 70 countries to reduce trade deficits and reshore manufacturing. Greer defended the use of tariffs not just for trade imbalances but also as a tool for geopolitical leverage, citing actions against Canada and Brazil related to non-trade issues. He argued that imposing a tariff is a lesser measure than full sanctions and is a legitimate use of presidential power to address national emergencies and foreign policy concerns.

Experts attribute the decline to multiple crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, which particularly affect the younger generation's decision to have children. While some view the trend as a sign of female self-determination, others see it as a threat to the nation's future prosperity.

Financial planners praise this approach, suggesting that focusing on cash flow and value-aligned goals is more beneficial than obsessing over a single number. Experts advise that understanding daily income and expenses allows for more actionable financial planning. They argue that fixating on net worth can lead to a constant feeling of not having enough, whereas focusing on tangible goals promotes greater financial well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after being struck by a boat on Saturday afternoon. The collision nearly capsized the vessel and sent a passenger overboard, though the person was recovered safely. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after being alerted to its presence in the bay earlier in the day. Due to tidal conditions, the whale's carcass will be moved on Monday to a nearby state park where a necropsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of death.</p>

          <p>Sir Chris Bryant, a Labour Member of Parliament, has publicly stated that he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1978 by Michael Croft, the late founder of the National Youth Theatre.

The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Bryant and other victims. Bryant also revealed he has been sexually assaulted by five unnamed male MPs during his time in Parliament but did not report them due to a lack of a system and fear of repercussions.</p>

          <p>The use of AI to automatically detect and bill for damages, as recently implemented by car rental companies, is a trend that could soon expand to the hotel industry. Experts predict that hotels may use "algorithmic auditing" with sensors and computer vision to identify issues like in-room smoking or property damage, then automatically charge guests. While some hotels are already using AI to flag potential problems for human review, the move toward fully automated billing raises concerns about false positives and eroding customer trust. The industry must balance operational efficiency with the risk of a customer backlash against perceived surveillance.</p>

The scheme used stolen identities and allowed the North Korean government to circumvent international sanctions and fund its weapons programs.

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully developed a new material, CHSN01, a high-strength cryogenic steel designed for use in nuclear fusion reactors. The material solves a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, as it can withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium and the immense magnetic forces inside the reactor. This breakthrough, the result of a decade of research, addresses a key materials science problem. The deployment of this "super steel" in the world's first fusion power generation reactor places China in a leading position in the field.</p>
