          <p>Senator Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, voiced serious apprehension about the Trump administration's lack of communication regarding its strategy with Iran. Warner, a member of the Gang of Eight, highlighted that even Republican colleagues seem uninformed about the administration's plans. He criticized the administration for potentially disregarding the intelligence community's consensus that Iran isn't actively developing nuclear weapons, drawing parallels to the manipulated intelligence that led to the Iraq War. Warner emphasized the importance of the intelligence community's role in providing truthful assessments to policymakers. The senator questioned the administration's decision to potentially disregard the consensus opinion of the intelligence community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's immigration policies are causing significant disruption to industries that rely on foreign-born workers, such as agriculture and hospitality. While Trump initially paused immigration raids, the Department of Homeland Security has since declared that there will be no safe spaces for industries harboring violent criminals or undermining immigration enforcement. Businesses are struggling to cope with the uncertainty, as workers fear being targeted by ICE, leading to labor shortages and economic instability. Economists estimate that undocumented workers make up a significant portion of the workforce in key sectors, and their deportation could negatively impact the economy. The fear of being targeted by ICE is causing employees to call out of work, creating labor shortages for businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An amber heat health alert has been issued across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C, posing risks to health and social care services. The UK Health Security Agency warns of likely impacts on the health service, including increased demand and difficulties managing medicines. There is a concern for internal temperatures in care settings exceeding recommended thresholds, and a possible rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 or over or with health conditions. The rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe. This alert system focuses on health risks and uses four levels of warning.</p>

          <p>China's embassy in Israel announced it will begin evacuating its citizens via the Egyptian border starting Friday, following the safe evacuation of hundreds from Israel and 1,600 from Iran. The decision comes after discussions between the Chinese and Egyptian foreign ministers. Evacuees must possess valid Chinese passports or identification, travel documents from Hong Kong or Macau, or a mainland-issued travel permit for Taiwan residents. Israel and Iran have been engaged in an air war for seven days, with missiles impacting strategic and residential areas since Israel's preemptive strike on Iran last Friday.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not be held simultaneously in July. This decision came as opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda stated he would not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet, aiming to prevent delays on crucial political matters. Ishiba expressed readiness to dissolve the lower house if the opposition submitted a no-confidence motion, but some parties were hesitant due to being unprepared for a general election. Amidst the conflict between Israel and Iran, analysts anticipate rising crude oil prices, which would negatively impact Japan, while U.S. tariffs weigh on the country's export-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel has called on the UK government to support the US if it attacks Iran, arguing that the UK cannot "hide behind legal advice at a time of crisis". Foreign Secretary David Lammy has traveled to Washington to meet his US counterpart Marco Rubio, after Donald Trump said he was considering whether to join Israeli strikes against Iran. However, there are reports the Attorney General Lord Hermer has privately raised questions over whether Israel's actions in Iran are lawful, which would restrict the government's ability to support any US action. Patel stressed that strikes have taken place "to degrade Iran's nuclear capabilities and their ballistic missile capabilities, which are a threat to us in the UK".</p>

This comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. While some prominent MAGA figures argue against US military involvement, citing Trump's America First policy, others support action to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Vice President JD Vance defended Trump, assuring that the president is only interested in using American military to accomplish the American people’s goals. The debate highlights the shift in the Republican Party under Trump's leadership regarding foreign military engagements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court allowed Tennessee's ban on transition-related healthcare for minors to remain in effect, a move critics say undermines gender equality. The ruling in United States v Skrmetti is likely to shield other bans on transition-related healthcare for minors, which are now on the books in most states. The court circumvented sex equality provisions in a way that seems to render moot much of the 14th amendment’s applicability to sex discrimination cases. Critics argue the decision weakens constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the sexes and permits discrimination based on gender identity.</p>

The author points to the case of Eleanor Holmes Norton, a long-serving congresswoman, as an example of the challenges posed by elderly politicians who may no longer be able to effectively serve. The article also criticizes the Democratic Party for its deference to incumbents and suggests that the U.S. could benefit from an institution similar to the British House of Lords, which provides an emeritus track for experienced politicians. Just about the only person I could imagine having the skill and force to change the Democratic Party’s culture is Nancy Pelosi.</p>

The author argues that Israel's actions have weakened Iran's position and could potentially lead to regime change. He also notes that President Trump's stance on the conflict has evolved, potentially opening the door for a new kind of peacemaking.

          <p>CoreCivic has reached an agreement with ICE to convert its California City facility into the state's largest migrant detention center, sparking concerns among advocates. The move comes after California closed the facility as part of efforts to end private prisons, but a federal court ruling allowed for its use in federal detention contracts. ICE is seeking to increase its detention capacity nationwide, leading to no-bid agreements with contractors like CoreCivic. The new facility will increase California's detention capacity by 36%, raising concerns about mismanagement, abuse, and unsafe conditions in ICE detention centers.

          <p>Detectives investigating the 1990 murder of UCLA student Ronald Baker uncovered a stunningly personal betrayal involving his roommates. Baker, a Wiccan practitioner, was found stabbed to death in a railroad tunnel known as the Manson Tunnel. Initially, investigators considered occult motives, but the focus shifted to Baker's roommates, Duncan Martinez and Nathan Blalock. Martinez, who initially acted as a grieving friend, was later implicated in the murder after fleeing the state and confessing to his involvement. The case revealed a senseless crime motivated by a twisted kidnapping plot. The killers set this thing up for the summer solstice.</p>
