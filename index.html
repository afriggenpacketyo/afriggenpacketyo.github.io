          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 14:15:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump issued an executive order targeting the Inflation Reduction Act's provision allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, proposing a change favoring pharmaceutical companies by modifying rules differentiating between small-molecule drugs and biologics. The order directs HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to work with Congress to eliminate the discrepancy, potentially increasing Medicare spending and drug prices, with Novo Nordisk standing to gain significantly. While beneficial for some drugmakers, the order also includes proposals opposed by the industry, such as opening pathways for drug imports from Canada, creating uncertainty for the pharmaceutical sector.

          <p>At least 20 tourists were killed in a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir's Pahalgam area, a popular tourist destination, marking the worst attack in the region in nearly a year. Gunmen opened fire on civilians, injuring dozens more, prompting a search operation by security forces; Prime Minister Modi condemned the attack, vowing justice, while President Trump pledged support for India against terrorism. The attack occurred during a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance to India, impacting the region's recovering tourism industry and raising concerns about ongoing instability in the disputed territory between India and Pakistan. The last major attack happened in June 2024, when nine people were killed and 33 injured as militants attacked a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims.</p>

At least 16 states are less than 50% compliant, requiring travelers to present a Real ID-compliant driver's license, passport, or other approved identification to pass through security. The TSA plans to implement secondary screening processes for those with non-compliant IDs, but travelers are advised to arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure to account for potential delays.

          <p>Bitcoin surpassed $90,000 as investors sought refuge from turbulent stock markets and a weakening dollar, fueled by President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experienced significant inflows, indicating a decoupling from traditional risk assets, with bitcoin outperforming gold in April. Analysts note bitcoin's resilience amid equity volatility, but caution that breaking the $93,000 resistance level requires a substantial catalyst like Fed easing or tariff deals. Chart analysis suggests $88,000 is a key resistance level, with potential for further gains if cleared. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decrease by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on China, impacting retailers like Temu and Shein who may reduce their ad spending on Facebook and Instagram. China accounts for over 11% of Meta's total sales, and a reduction in ad campaigns from Chinese online retailers could significantly affect the company's revenue. A prolonged economic downturn combined with the trade dispute could further reduce Meta's ad revenues by $23 billion, impacting earnings.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman stated that he does not believe transgender women are women, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance, where he said trans women are women, and has sparked criticism from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who accuses the government of changing its position in response to the judgement. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to use women-only spaces if deemed disproportionate, leading to debate about single-sex spaces and transgender rights. While Starmer maintains that trans women should be treated with dignity and respect, many Labour MPs are uneasy about his recent comments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has raised concerns about his independence, but economists suggest that even firing Powell may not guarantee the rate cuts Trump desires. To control monetary policy, Trump might need to replace the entire Fed Board, potentially triggering market backlash with a falling dollar and rising rates. Individual Fed members could resist pressure from a new leader, and analysts warn that undermining the Fed's independence could increase inflation risks.

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case revolves around whether the school board unconstitutionally burdens parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom by requiring children to participate in instruction that violates their religious beliefs. The court's conservative majority questioned the school board's refusal to allow opt-outs, drawing comparisons to opt-out policies for other areas of instruction. The case has sparked debate about the balance between religious freedom and promoting inclusivity in public education.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's policies could inflict a $1 trillion blow to global output, stemming from his trade policies and pressure on the Federal Reserve. The IMF highlights that the U.S.'s effective tariff rate has reached a century high, creating instability in global markets, and that hedge funds' bets have gone sour, requiring them to sell US treasuries for cash. The report warns that the US, meant to uphold global financial architecture, is at the heart of this chaos, with Trump's attacks on the Fed chair increasing the flight from US equities, bonds, and the dollar, raising concerns about the politicization of the monetary-fiscal nexus.</p>

          <p>Bill Owens, the executive producer of '60 Minutes,' resigned amid efforts by Paramount Global to settle a $20 billion lawsuit filed by President Trump regarding the network’s interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump claims the program was deceptively edited to favor Harris. Owens' departure could indicate a settlement is forthcoming, as Paramount Global executives view the suit as an obstacle to the company's merger agreement with Skydance Media. Owens cited his inability to make independent decisions for the show as the reason for his resignation, after working at CBS News for 37 years.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey reveals that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, citing concerns about Musk's controversial political activities. Tesla's stock has been under pressure, with protests at Tesla offices across the nation. The survey indicates a strong polarization, with Democrats and young people more positive about electric vehicles in general but negative about Tesla, while Republicans are positive about Tesla but negative about EVs. The findings suggest Tesla's brand image may be alienating potential customers, despite overall interest in electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, during a visit to India, emphasized the importance of the US-India partnership for global progress, contrasting India's confidence with the "self-loathing" West. He praised Prime Minister Modi and highlighted the potential for US oil and gas exports to support India's growth. Vance said US and Indian negotiators had finalized "terms of reference" for a bilateral trade agreement that Delhi is urgently seeking, in hopes that it will allow the country to dodge steep tariff increases announced by Trump. He also pitched for the US to supply more military equipment to India, including the F-35 stealth fighter.</p>

          <p>Stocks rebounded after a major sell-off triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with the Dow Jones making up significant ground. The previous day's tumble was fueled by Trump's renewed attacks on Powell and uncertainty about trade policy, but positive factors such as the potential for a US-India trade deal and Congressional support for Fed independence contributed to the recovery. Despite the rebound, Trump's trade war continues to impact global markets, with the IMF citing the escalating trade war and policy uncertainty as factors in reducing the U.S. economic growth forecast.</p>

          <p>Tesla short sellers have profited $11.5 billion this year as the company's stock price has plummeted, facing challenges including increased competition, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's controversial political activities. Tesla shares plummeted 36% in the first quarter, their worst performance for any period since 2022, and have continued to drop in April, largely on concerns that President Trump's sweeping tariffs on top trade partners will increase the cost of parts and materials crucial for EV production. The company is also struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet's Waymo.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that President Trump's tariffs will lead to higher inflation and slower global economic growth, reducing the global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8%. The IMF's Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) found that global financial stability risks have increased significantly, driven by tighter global financial conditions and heightened economic uncertainty. The US' especially high levies on China and Beijing's retaliatory measures mean lower bilateral trade, which is weighing down on global trade growth, with zero growth for the German economy in 2025.</p>
