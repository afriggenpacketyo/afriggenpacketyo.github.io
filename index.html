This fiscal move aims to reduce interest rates and promote transparent debt management.

The judges, acting as residents, claim the city must take responsibility for the damages caused by the fire, which they believe was a result of known but ignored risks.

          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen claim that a U.S. strike targeted a migrant detention center in Saada, resulting in at least 35 deaths. The U.S. military has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since mid-March to counter their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians amid the conflict in Gaza. CENTCOM reports that these strikes have degraded the pace and effectiveness of Houthi attacks, though the Houthis continue to claim attacks against both U.S. vessels and Israel.</p>

          <p>The Peace Corps is set to undergo "significant restructuring efforts" following an assessment by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge). The agency is offering staff a second "fork in the road" buyout, referred to as "DRP 2.0," as part of the cost-cutting measures. Doge, tasked with identifying waste and abuse in federal agencies, has been targeting agencies involved in foreign aid and development. While the cuts are expected to affect agency staff, the Peace Corps will continue to recruit, place, and train volunteers.</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks as part of its efforts to tackle obesity. The proposal involves ending the exemption for dairy-based and non-dairy substitute drinks from the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL). The government is also consulting on reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy. The Treasury argues that the health benefits of milk-based drinks do not justify the harms from excess sugar.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to reinstate Columbus Day with the same rules and dates as before, despite the growing recognition of Indigenous Peoples Day. Trump blamed Democrats for attempting to destroy Christopher Columbus's reputation and criticized the removal of statues. Some Italian American groups praised Trump's message, viewing it as symbolic for their community. The celebration of Columbus Day has faced increasing scrutiny due to Columbus's role in bringing deadly diseases to the Americas and initiating centuries of European exploitation.</p>

While some women express concerns about having a male radiographer, others argue that the focus should be on accessing life-saving screening regardless of the gender of the healthcare provider.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with sanctuary cities and states by signing executive orders aimed at enforcing immigration laws. These orders direct federal agencies to publish a list of sanctuary cities and threaten them with a withdrawal of federal funding and potential lawsuits. The administration argues that sanctuary jurisdictions obstruct federal immigration officials and prioritize aliens over American citizens. The move is part of Trump's focus on immigration as he approaches his 100th day in office, but it faces legal challenges from cities and states that defend their sanctuary policies.</p>
