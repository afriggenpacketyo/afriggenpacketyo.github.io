          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has announced holds on Trump's judicial nominees due to concerns over a potential Qatari-funded Air Force One for Trump, calling it corrupt. Schumer is demanding Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before Congress to address whether the deal violates the emoluments clause, which requires congressional approval for such gifts. He believes this Qatari plane deal is only the beginning of Trump's business dealings in the Middle East, which Schumer claims are examples of crooked self-enrichment, thus prompting the investigation. The Trump administration has not yet commented on this situation, but the investigation will likely delve deeper into the President's financial connections in the region.</p>

          <p>The article examines the stadium concert experience, questioning whether it truly benefits fans or primarily serves artists and corporations. While stadium tours are increasingly popular and lucrative, driven by social media and fear of missing out, fans often face high costs, logistical challenges, and compromised views. Concertgoers prioritize online posting of their experiences, which can alter the enjoyment of the music. Stadiums, designed for sports, often lack optimal acoustics, leading to sonic issues, and VIP experiences sometimes fall short of expectations, raising questions about the sustainability of the stadium tour trend.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, potentially limiting his ability to unilaterally impose import taxes. The lawsuit, brought by domestic businesses reliant on imported goods, argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize Trump's sweeping duties. The plaintiffs claim the declared national emergency is unfounded, while the Department of Justice contends IEEPA clearly grants the president the power to impose tariffs.

          <p>Small businesses are challenging President Trump's tariffs in the Court of International Trade, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to unilaterally impose such duties. The businesses claim that Trump's declaration of a national emergency is unfounded and that the tariffs would irreparably harm their operations. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that Congress permits the president to impose them, and that blocking the tariffs would encroach on the president's authority.</p>

          <p>In his guest essay for The New York Times, Thomas B. Edsall explores how Donald Trump's 'shamelessness' and open self-enrichment have become a powerful political tool. Drawing on insights from various political scientists and historians, Edsall argues that Trump's base views his defiance of norms and rules as a sign that he is capable of destroying a system rigged against them. Experts suggest that Trump's brazen behavior, coupled with the demonization of political adversaries, has normalized corruption in the eyes of his supporters, while also exploiting vulnerabilities within Democratic programs aimed at addressing inequality.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the ongoing debate among economists and policymakers regarding the effectiveness of 'neoliberal' economic policies and their impact on the Democratic Party's agenda. Following Donald Trump's victory in 2016, many Democrats embraced a more populist approach, but his restoration in 2024 has led to renewed scrutiny of Biden's economic policies. The article explores whether Democrats lost in 2024 because of or despite their embrace of post-neoliberalism, and examines the successes and failures of Biden's economic agenda in addressing issues such as climate change, job creation, and political resilience.</p>
