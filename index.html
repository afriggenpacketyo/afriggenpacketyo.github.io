        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of consumers in the UK may be eligible to receive approximately £70 each due to a court ruling that found Mastercard charged unfair fees over a 15-year period from 1992 to 2008. The legal case was initiated by Walter Merricks, a former financial ombudsman, who argued that these fees led to inflated prices for shoppers. While the fees were paid by retailers, Merricks contended that the costs were passed on to consumers. A £200 million settlement has been reached, and individuals do not need to have owned a Mastercard to claim a share.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report by Climate Central indicates that climate change has nearly doubled the average number of "pregnancy heat-risk days" in the U.S. between 2020 and 2024, increasing the danger of preterm birth and other complications for pregnant women. Dr. Céline Gounder emphasizes that pregnant women are more susceptible to heat-related issues due to the increased stress on their hearts and the higher likelihood of dehydration. Staying cool is crucial, especially during the third trimester, as extreme heat poses the most significant risks during this period. With potential cuts to heat safety resources, Gounder advises pregnant women to proactively manage their exposure to high temperatures.</p>

This decision comes after a delay in the museum's opening, originally scheduled for 2023 and later pushed to 2025. Additionally, Sandra Jackson-Dumont, the museum’s director and chief executive, stepped down earlier this year, with George Lucas taking a more active role in curatorial decisions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has imposed sanctions on Daniella Weiss, a far-right Israeli settler leader, and suspended free trade negotiations with Israel in response to escalating violence and policies in the West Bank and Gaza. Weiss, described as the "godmother" of the settler movement, is accused of inciting aggression against Palestinians. The UK also sanctioned other settlers, outposts, and organizations, citing concerns over the Israeli government's failure to halt aggressive actions. Israel's foreign ministry has criticized the sanctions as unjustified and regrettable, while Weiss has vowed to continue settlement efforts in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is accused of targeting women through policies that undermine reproductive rights and support for victims of sexual assault. Actions include ceasing enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act, withholding funds from Title X, and cutting funding for maternal mortality research. Additionally, the administration has suspended grant applications for organizations providing services to victims of domestic and sexual violence and halted military sexual assault prevention training. These policies are seen as disproportionately harming women and limiting access to essential healthcare and support services.</p>
