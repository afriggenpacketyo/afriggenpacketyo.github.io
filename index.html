        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgend council in Wales faced criticism after a leaked PowerPoint presentation, intended for use in schools, appeared to endorse strangulation during sex. One slide stated, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claimed it was a draft version that was never shown to children and was dropped after professional feedback. Experts and politicians expressed concern over why such material was ever deemed appropriate, given that non-fatal strangulation is a criminal offense. The council said the slide was meant to stimulate debate before advising that non-fatal strangulation is dangerous and illegal.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay, current co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a joint leadership bid with Ellie Chowns, MP for North Herefordshire, as Carla Denyer will not seek re-election. Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its "most ambitious chapter yet," focusing on national politics and winning power across the country. They join deputy leader Zack Polanski in the leadership race, who is campaigning on building a "mass movement" to counter Reform UK. The Green Party achieved its best-ever result in the 2024 general election, winning seats in four constituencies and increasing its number of councillors for the eighth consecutive year.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a student-led movement is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking the largest and most extensive protest movement the country has seen. Sparked by a train station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16 people, believed to be due to corruption, the protests have spread across the country. The government's attempts to quell the unrest, including the resignation of the prime minister and offers of loans to young people, have failed to deter the demonstrators. Protesters are calling for early elections, demonstrating a united front against the current regime.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it would release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, believed to be the last living US national captive in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East. Hamas said the release was intended to facilitate a deal for humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Negotiations are ongoing, with Israel maintaining preparations to intensify fighting despite the potential release. Trump confirmed the release as a positive step, urging further negotiations for the remaining hostages.</p>

One veteran recounted the routine killing of detainees, followed by planting a pistol on the body. The Ministry of Defence stated its commitment to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes and urged veterans with relevant information to come forward.

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to its rightful owner, resolving a long-standing dispute. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. The return concludes a legal battle that began when a South Korean temple claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, a claim rejected by South Korea's Supreme Court in 2023.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid, framing it as a way to eliminate "waste, fraud, and abuse" and fund $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. Democrats warn that these cuts will result in millions of Americans losing healthcare coverage. The proposed changes include new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid recipients. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggests the proposals would reduce the number of people with healthcare by 8.6 million over the next decade, leading to concerns about hospital closures and rising premiums.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses and adult dependents of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also face restrictions on recruiting staff from abroad. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that new immigrants must earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK, prioritizing residency for those who pay taxes, work in public service, or volunteer. These measures come as the government seeks to address concerns about rising legal migration and counter the influence of Reform UK.

          <p>A measure in President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at restricting federal funding for abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The proposal, which would make large groups that provide abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid dollars, has raised concerns about how those groups are defined. Some Republicans argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. Several moderate lawmakers have indicated they may oppose the bill if the provision is included, highlighting potential challenges to its passage.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court discovered documents associated with the Nazi regime, including propaganda material, within its archives. The material was found during preparations for a museum of historical documents. The items, believed to have arrived in Buenos Aires in 1941, were intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina. Argentina, home to the largest Jewish population in Latin America, served as a refuge for many Nazis after World War II. The court has ordered the preservation and thorough analysis of the discovered material.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad asserts that President Donald Trump's tariffs will hurt the U.S. more than targeted countries, increasing the cost of living for Americans. He argues that American products cannot compete with cheaper goods from other countries, leading to economic suffering. Mahathir suggests that ASEAN can withstand the impact of tariff hikes through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the U.S. He also advocates for peaceful resolutions to international conflicts and praises Japan's war-renouncing Constitution.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctors' offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation's policy" aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans. The proposal, likely to face opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, would primarily affect certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B. Trump has long criticized pharmaceutical companies for high drug prices and accused other countries of taking advantage of Americans.</p>
