          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging in the second quarter, partly driven by the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones. While Apple still leads, its recent decline and Samsung's diverse product range, from budget-friendly to premium folding devices, signal a renewed and intense competition between the tech giants. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond with its own foldable iPhone and a new slimmer model to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy provides a three-step framework for building emotional endurance, the capacity to manage stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. The process involves visualizing learning as a non-linear journey, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal narratives, and undertaking small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. These techniques help individuals view challenges as growth opportunities rather than signs of failure, fostering greater resilience over time.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is supporting efforts to redraw the state's congressional districts before the 2026 midterms, a move that could further entrench Republican control. Citing a recent state supreme court ruling that validated a previous map favoring the GOP, DeSantis and legislative allies are now targeting districts in South Florida held by Democrats. Critics and Florida Democrats argue this is a partisan power grab aimed at silencing voters and rigging elections, while the governor frames it as an appropriate response to new census possibilities and legal precedents.</p>

The event has reignited discussions about the persistence of racism in football, with figures like Virgil van Dijk calling the abuse a "disgrace" and others highlighting the need for more effective anti-racism measures.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. Trump stated on Truth Social that the goal is to broker a "Peace Agreement" to end the war, rather than a temporary ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and European leaders, who reportedly expressed support for Trump's efforts while insisting on "ironclad security guarantees" for Ukraine as a precondition for any deal.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with the Canadian Union of Public Employees, leading to a strike by more than 10,000 flight attendants.

          <p>Thousands are expected to participate in "Fight the Trump Takeover" protests across 34 states to oppose Republican-led efforts to redraw congressional maps mid-decade in states like Texas and Florida. The demonstrations, organized by groups including MoveOn and Indivisible, argue that these redistricting plans are a partisan attempt to "steal Congress" by creating gerrymandered districts that favor the GOP. The national day of action comes as Democratic leaders, such as California's Governor Gavin Newsom, have proposed retaliatory redistricting measures, escalating the political battle over electoral maps.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Advise Saving for Retirement Earlier Than Most Americans Think Ideal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a recent survey found that Americans believe age 27 is the ideal time to start saving for retirement, certified financial planners recommend beginning even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound returns. Starting in one's early 20s allows savings more time to grow, potentially creating a much larger nest egg by retirement. Many Americans express regret over not starting to save sooner, as a later start often requires more aggressive saving strategies to catch up and achieve retirement goals, such as the surveyed ideal retirement age of 58.

Young residents, particularly in minority communities, say the heightened presence of federal officers feels intimidating and oppressive, rather than protective. They argue that the administration's rhetoric about "wild youth" is misplaced and that true safety comes from addressing root causes of crime like poverty and lack of resources, not from what they perceive as a hostile and untrustworthy show of force.</p>
