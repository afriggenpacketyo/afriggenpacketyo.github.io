          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, alongside Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has initiated a plan to end all childhood vaccine mandates for schools and daycares, a first-of-its-kind move in the nation. Dr. Ladapo described the current requirements as an infringement on parental rights, while critics, such as Democratic state Representative Anna Eskamani, have condemned the proposal as a potential public health disaster. The administration also announced a new state-level health commission aimed at promoting "medical freedom" and plans to introduce a legislative package to make these changes permanent.</p>

Facing a maximum of 65 years in prison, she also admitted responsibility for a separate 2019 overdose death, highlighting the extensive nature of her illegal drug operations from her North Hollywood residence.</p>

          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly topped 5% before retreating after the Labor Department's latest report showed fewer job openings than economists had anticipated. Yields fell across the board in response to the weaker economic data, with the 10-year Treasury note also seeing a significant drop. The market volatility is also influenced by uncertainty over President Trump's tariffs and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence, as investors await Friday's comprehensive jobs report for further direction.

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has publicly criticized the Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion, labeling the move "a step towards socialism." Paul argued that government ownership in private companies is a mistake and undermines free-market principles, expressing concern over a trend that includes government stakes in other tech and materials companies. The investment, which President Trump praised as a "great Deal for America," has found unusual support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders, who believes taxpayers should benefit from corporate subsidies.

          <p>Newsmax has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the media giant of unlawfully monopolizing the market for right-leaning cable news. The lawsuit alleges that Fox News uses its dominant position to coerce television distributors into exclusionary agreements that marginalize competitors like Newsmax, thereby harming competition and consumers. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction against these practices and triple the amount of damages sustained. Fox News has dismissed the lawsuit, stating that Newsmax is attempting to sue its way out of its own competitive failures.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with the Polish President, President Donald Trump sharply rebuked a reporter from a Polish media outlet who claimed his administration had taken "no action" against Russia. Trump defended his record by citing secondary sanctions imposed on India for its purchases from Russia, which he claimed cost Moscow hundreds of billions of dollars. The exchange occurred after Trump had accused the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea of "conspiring" against the U.S. following their joint appearance at a military parade in Beijing.</p>

          <p>An unguarded conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin was caught on a hot mic during a military parade in Beijing, where they discussed biotechnology and longevity. According to a translation, Putin's translator mentioned that with organ transplants, people could live younger and potentially achieve immortality, while Xi's translator noted predictions of lifespans reaching 150 years. The exchange provided a rare, candid glimpse into the personal thoughts of the two powerful leaders as they projected a united front against the U.S.-led world order.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to shrink or potentially dissolve the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is causing a significant number of experienced disaster-management officials to leave for the private sector. Critics fear this brain drain will transfer federal expertise to for-profit consulting firms, which states will then have to hire to manage disasters, potentially increasing costs and reducing transparency. While the administration aims to shift more responsibility to the states, many experts warn that most states are unprepared to handle major catastrophes without federal coordination and financial support.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has publicly supported initiating an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September, citing concerns about a rapidly deteriorating labor market. Waller, who is considered a potential candidate for Fed chair, argued that rates are currently restrictive and that multiple cuts could be necessary over the next several months to avoid economic damage. He emphasized the need for flexibility, stating that the Fed could adjust the pace of cuts based on incoming data, including the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, known as the 6-5 Fire, has burned homes and forced evacuations in Chinese Camp, a historic California town founded by Chinese miners during the Gold Rush era.

This fire is part of a larger complex of lightning-sparked fires in the region, which have collectively burned over 19 square miles, adding to the state's challenging wildfire season.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's joint appearance with the leaders of China and Russia at a Beijing military parade marks a significant step in his multilateral diplomacy. Analysts suggest Kim's primary goal is to revitalize economic support from China, North Korea's largest trading partner, as trade has slowed in recent years. While the public display projects an image of a united front against the U.S., experts believe a formal trilateral alliance is unlikely, but Kim may use the strengthened relationships as leverage in any future negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>For savers looking to deposit $50,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), the "best" rate depends on their financial goals. While short-term CDs currently offer the highest interest rates, with 6-month terms yielding around 4.45%, longer-term CDs can provide a greater overall return due to the extended compounding period. For example, a 2-year CD at a slightly lower rate of 4.10% would earn significantly more interest over its term than a shorter-term, higher-rate option, forcing investors to choose between maximizing their rate and maximizing their total earnings.
