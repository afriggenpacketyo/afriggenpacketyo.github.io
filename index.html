          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 00:19:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy experienced a significant slowdown in July, as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output failed to meet forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, falling short of the expected 4.6%, while industrial output also saw its weakest rise since last November. The National Bureau of Statistics cited a challenging external environment and extreme weather as contributing factors, though analysts also point to the fading effects of government stimulus and policies aimed at curbing unsustainable business competition. The disappointing data raises concerns about achieving the annual growth target of 5% and increases calls for new policy support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The hastily arranged summit comes after Trump has pushed for a ceasefire, setting a deadline that has now passed. The choice of Alaska, a former Russian territory sold to the U.S. in 1867, adds historical resonance to the talks. While the White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," Trump has expressed hopes of achieving a ceasefire, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend the initial discussions.</p>

          <p>A major federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated Thursday following the discovery of an unknown white powder. The FDNY and hazmat units responded swiftly after five separate letters containing the substance were found in the mailroom on the ninth floor. At least two people were exposed to the powder, but authorities stated that no immediate threat remains to employees or the public. The FBI is analyzing the substance, and an investigation into the incident is ongoing as officials urge the public to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, is forecast to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by Friday and potentially become a major hurricane over the weekend. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm is moving west-northwest and is projected to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, prompting authorities in the Caribbean to issue tropical storm watches. The storm has already caused significant flooding and at least eight fatalities in the Cabo Verde islands off the African coast.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending more aggressive and earlier treatment. The guidelines now suggest that individuals with systolic blood pressure between 130-139 should first adopt lifestyle changes, and if that fails, begin medication, a shift from the previous 140 threshold. In a notable change, the recommendations also advocate for complete abstinence from alcohol, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. These updates emphasize proactive measures to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia.</p>

He pointed out that other parties with fewer votes and MPs have peers, while the Liberal Democrats have 76. The move aims to address what Farage describes as a "seismic shift" in British politics, reflecting his party's recent electoral gains.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly escalated its federal oversight of Washington, D.C., by appointing the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the city's "emergency police commissioner." This directive, issued by Attorney General Pam Bondi, effectively places the Metropolitan Police Department under federal command, requiring it to seek approval from Cole for all new orders. The move rescinds several local policies that limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities, a central part of President Trump's broader law-enforcement takeover of the capital. This assertion of federal authority over a local government is a major development in the ongoing crackdown.</p>

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national allegedly acting as a foreign agent. The government claimed the plot was supported by unnamed foreign states and aimed to destabilize the country. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the junta, which seized power in 2020 and has since shifted its allegiance from Western partners like France towards Russia. The arrests, including that of a popular general, are seen by some analysts as a move to intimidate and consolidate power rather than a response to a legitimate coup attempt.</p>

Putin is expected to be deeply familiar with the historical and legal details of the Ukraine conflict, a stark contrast to Trump's approach. The strategy will likely involve exploiting Trump's desire for a quick resolution and public credit, potentially by offering superficial concessions, such as a loosely defined promise for a future meeting with President Zelenskyy. Putin may also appeal to Trump's transactional nature with offers of economic cooperation, aiming to secure a deal that ultimately favors Russia's terms.</p>

This article argues that this conclusion honors the original show's core theme: that female friendships can be the most powerful and fulfilling relationships.

According to the project team, this new drone is significantly superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use. This technological advancement could dramatically expand the operational range and surveillance capabilities of the Chinese navy without requiring traditional aircraft carriers.</p>

          <p>President Trump shrugged off concerns about Latin American nations, including Brazil, increasing their coordination with China in response to U.S. tariffs. When asked about the trend, Trump stated that the U.S. economy is "blowing everyone away, including China," and suggested that the Latin American countries in question are not performing well economically. His comments came as Brazil is actively working with Beijing to formulate a multilateral response to the steep tariffs Washington imposed on a wide range of Brazilian exports in late July. The remarks underscore the administration's confidence in its economic strategy despite growing international realignments.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have announced they will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a Border Patrol agent in Vermont. A grand jury indicted Youngblut on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Agent David Maland during a traffic stop in January. The incident, which also resulted in the death of her companion, occurred after the pair had been under surveillance for appearing armed and wearing tactical gear. Authorities have linked the shooting to a cultlike group known as the Zizians, which has been connected to several deaths across three states.</p>

          <p>As students in Los Angeles returned to school, many families in immigrant communities reported living in a state of fear due to increased immigration enforcement activity. Recent operations, including a large-scale federal agent presence in MacArthur Park, have left parents anxious, with some considering keeping their children home from school to avoid potential separation. In response, the LAUSD has implemented "safe zones" around 100 schools to monitor for federal activity and protect families. The climate of uncertainty was heightened by the recent mistaken detention of a 15-year-old student by federal agents outside his high school.</p>

          <p>A man from Riverside County, California, has been arrested for allegedly impersonating a hospital employee to steal over $100,000 worth of valuable medical equipment. Authorities say Jason Brauner, 47, dressed in scrubs and a surgical mask to gain access and steal surgical tools and skin grafts from a hospital on multiple occasions. He was apprehended during a traffic stop in San Diego County, where deputies found stolen medical items in his vehicle. A subsequent search of his home uncovered additional stolen supplies, and he is now a suspect in similar thefts at other hospitals in the region.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, citing significant challenges in affordability, safety, and economic strength. The state scored particularly poorly on affordability, ranking as the third-worst in the nation, and was also noted for its vulnerability to environmental hazards like wildfires and drought. In contrast, neighboring Washington was ranked the 35th best state, outperforming Oregon in areas like economy, healthcare, and education. The report suggests these factors are driving relocation decisions and present obstacles for Oregon in attracting and retaining residents.</p>

In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling party, smashing windows and smearing it with red paint before riot police dispersed the crowd. The clashes are the latest in months of student-led protests, initially sparked by a deadly infrastructure collapse blamed on corruption, which have grown to demand early elections. Vucic, who has been accused of fostering authoritarianism, has condemned the protesters and promised more arrests.</p>

The meeting focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and ensuring that any potential peace deal protects the country's territorial integrity.

          <p>Martin Eberhard, one of the original co-founders of Tesla, has sharply criticized the company's Cybertruck, stating that it "looks like a dumpster." In a recent interview, Eberhard expressed disappointment that Tesla canceled its planned low-end, budget-friendly car program in favor of developing the highly stylized truck. His comments come as Cybertruck sales have fallen significantly, dropping by over 50% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year. Eberhard's critique highlights a divergence in vision from current CEO Elon Musk, suggesting the world needs more affordable electric vehicles rather than niche, high-concept products.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is experiencing a steady economic revival. After decades of high unemployment and population decline, the city is seeing new life as entrepreneurs repurpose abandoned industrial buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market. The city's population has now stabilized, and its unemployment rate is only slightly above the national average, with employment figures returning to pre-pandemic levels. This gradual comeback is being driven by a resilient community determined to forge a new identity beyond its industrial past.</p>
