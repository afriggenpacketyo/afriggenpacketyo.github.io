          <p>Microsoft reported a robust fiscal third quarter, surpassing revenue and earnings estimates, driven by Azure's accelerating revenue growth. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year to $70 billion, with earnings per share up 17% to $3.46, exceeding expectations. Azure's revenue growth was a significant highlight, with AI services contributing 16 points to its growth rate. The company's guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter was also better than expected, particularly for Azure.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech criticizing the Trump administration's first 100 days, accusing it of abandoning American ideals and advancing a narrow, self-serving vision. Harris claimed Trump's policies are bringing chaos to the U.S., particularly through tariffs, which she described as the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history. She also alluded to the administration’s deportation policies, saying it is not okay to detain or disappear American citizens without due process. Harris praised congressional Democrats resisting the Trump administration, and called on Americans to stand together and gear up for the hard work ahead.</p>

          <p>A "baby hatch" at San-ikukai Hospital in Tokyo has been used for the first time since its opening on March 31, marking the second such facility in Japan. The hospital aims to provide a safe avenue for distressed parents to anonymously leave infants they cannot raise. The hospital accepts babies up to 4 weeks old and pledges to attend to them within one minute of being left, after which a child welfare center is notified.

          <p>This article reflects on America's shifting role in Asia, contrasting it with the past when the U.S. was seen as a beacon of hope and democracy. The article notes that China's influence is growing, filling the void left by a perceived American withdrawal. The author recounts anecdotes of American aid workers being fired while assisting with earthquake relief in Myanmar, and a Cambodian general expressing concern about the state of American democracy. Despite these shifts, American ideals and images continue to resonate, even as China expands its reach.</p>

          <p>Several major European automakers, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have withdrawn or cut their full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainty related to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. These companies reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profits, attributing the industry pain to the tariffs. While Trump has sought to ease these levies, analysts warn that the fast-changing nature of trade policies will likely keep long-term corporate investment decisions at bay. Volvo Cars also ditched its financial guidance, announcing cost-cutting plans in response to tariff pressure.</p>

          <p>This article explores how individuals who fled authoritarian regimes view the tactics employed by the Trump administration. Many of these individuals see similarities between Trump's actions and those of the regimes they escaped, including aggressive questioning at borders, targeting of universities, and attacks on critical news organizations. Some immigrants, however, disagree, arguing that former President Biden's actions were more reminiscent of authoritarian leaders. The article highlights concerns about freedom of speech and academic freedom under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>India's forthcoming trade deal with the United States and its intensifying conflict with Pakistan could impede a recovery in ties between New Delhi and Beijing. While China-India relations had been improving, India's economic alignment with Washington and ongoing tensions with Pakistan present new challenges. The article notes that China views India as an important player in its efforts to engage with Global South economies, but these developments could complicate that relationship. The article notes that China's ties with India, which had been marked by clashes along their shared border, had improved as both sides took steps towards a thaw.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has scaled back a proposed bill that aimed to end solar credits for rooftop solar system owners. The revised bill now applies only to those who sell their homes, removing a controversial provision that would have limited benefits to 10 years. Despite the amendment, rooftop solar owners expressed concerns that the measure would still reduce the value of their homes. The bill is supported by major utilities, who argue that the financial credits given to rooftop solar owners are raising electric bills for those who don't own the panels.</p>

Despite inflation remaining above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank highlighted that it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised." The move comes at a time of global trade tensions, with the U.S. pressuring countries to sign business deals under threats of "reciprocal" tariffs.</p>

This decline is likely in preparation for the de minimis trade loophole ending, which benefited online retailers like Temu and Shein.

By utilizing the LNG-fired plant, Jera seeks to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation.

Representatives for Villaraigosa dismissed the lawsuit as ludicrous and Trump-like tactics.
