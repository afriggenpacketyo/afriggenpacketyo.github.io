          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that a significant majority (83.7%) of Japanese citizens are worried about the potential repercussions of the ongoing war in the Middle East on their daily lives, largely due to Japan's reliance on the region for oil imports. The poll also revealed a decline in public approval for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, dropping to 32.5% from 37.0% the previous week, while disapproval rose to 50.9%. Regarding the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's plan to distribute 20,000 yen to alleviate inflation, 41.9% supported it, while 54.8% opposed it. A majority (55.7%) favored using increased tax revenue to lower consumption tax. The poll was conducted to assess voters' views on government performance and key societal issues. </p>

          <p>David 'Syd' Lawrence, a former England and Gloucestershire fast bowler, has passed away at the age of 61 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). Lawrence, the first British-born black cricketer to represent England, was appointed MBE earlier this month for his efforts in raising money and awareness for the condition. During his 16-year career at Gloucestershire, he played five Test matches for England and took 625 wickets in 280 matches.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The landscape of abortion access in the U.S. is evolving, with self-managed medication abortion, involving abortion pills taken without a doctor's oversight, gaining acceptance. The shift was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, leading to increased use of telehealth and mail-order pills. While some clinicians initially had concerns, studies have shown self-managed abortion to be safe and effective. However, political challenges remain, with some states attempting to restrict access to abortion pills and telehealth services. The trend towards demedicalized abortion options reflects a broader effort to increase access despite legal barriers.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table to ensure stability in the region. Starmer emphasized that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, supporting the U.S. action to mitigate that threat. The BBC reports that the UK was not involved in the strikes but was informed in advance. Iran's ambassador to the UK has stated that Iran is considering its response, while Iran's foreign minister condemned the U.S. strikes as outrageous with everlasting consequences, and the UN Secretary-General called the strikes a dangerous escalation.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan has expressed "grave concern" regarding the U.S. attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran, but he refrained from stating whether Japan supports the military action by its security ally. Ishiba told reporters that de-escalating the situation is of utmost importance. While there have been no immediate reports of impacts on energy supplies, he has instructed officials to closely monitor the situation and take necessary measures, as resource-scarce Japan relies heavily on the Middle East for crude oil. The Prime Minister's cautious response underscores Japan's delicate position amidst escalating tensions in the region.</p>

Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, asserted that Khamenei must step down and advocated for a democratic, non-nuclear republic with separation of religion and state.

          <p>With escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, speculation rises about the possibility of regime change in Tehran, but history shows such interventions often have disastrous consequences. Eckart Woertz from the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA) warns against external regime change, citing examples like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya where foreign intervention led to prolonged instability and violence. He argues that a ground force would be required to change the government in Iran, and that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to succeed. The article suggests caution, emphasizing the potential for unintended and negative outcomes from attempting to impose regime change from the outside.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Trump for a decision that "will change history," potentially completing Israel's war aim of neutralizing the Iranian nuclear threat. The strikes, particularly on the Fordo facility, have significantly altered the conflict's trajectory. While Iran had previously moved its nuclear material, the U.S. action may prevent Iran from achieving a clear point of neutralizing the nuclear threat without regime change. Iran's response will determine whether the conflict escalates further, with potential repercussions for regional stability.</p>

          <p>The new Payment Connect service, linking Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS) to mainland China's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS), saw high usage on its launch day. The service allows users to transfer money across the border for various daily activities, such as travel, meals, and education. The scheme grants Hong Kong residents a new daily remittance quota for the yuan, which is expected to boost Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. This initiative facilitates easier cross-border payments for millions of users.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists are exploring the potential of using the spleen as a hub for treating diabetes, with advances in cell transplantation showing promising results. Research indicates that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. Scientists also found that the spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles. These findings suggest that the spleen could become an ideal organ for islet transplantation, offering a new avenue for treating diabetes, which affects millions worldwide.</p>

Stephanie had grieved the loss of Jessica and the Pelley family, maintaining their graves and always hoping to reconnect. Jessica, who had been cut off from her friends after the murders, eventually ran away and entered foster care, unaware of Stephanie's search. Their reunion led to a strong bond, with the women now calling each other "sister," and resolving the mystery of the missing flowers from the Pelley family graves.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband was overturned after spending nearly two decades in prison, as new evidence and testing revealed issues with the original investigation. Working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, new DNA testing showed that some blood spots were not blood at all, and other DNA found at the scene did not belong to her. The prosecution eventually dropped the charges, leading to her release, but questions remain about the handling of the case and the pursuit of justice for Bob Dorotik.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that the U.S. successfully bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, with Israel confirming coordination in the strikes. The facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, are vital to Iran's nuclear ambitions. While the extent of the damage remains unclear, Iran has confirmed the strikes but denies significant impact, stating that materials were evacuated. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the bombing, while the IAEA reported no increase in radiation levels. The strikes mark a major escalation in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites involves two key gambles: that the sites have been completely obliterated and that Iran will not retaliate effectively. Success depends on the accuracy of the U.S. assessment of the damage and Iran's response. A repeat of the 2019 Soleimani assassination scenario, where Iran's response was limited, is the best-case scenario. However, any significant Iranian retaliation could lead to a spiral of escalation. The success of this strategy depends on whether Iran's response is limited and whether Trump's supporters will support his decision to involve the U.S. in a new conflict.</p>
