          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has invalidated regulations from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that required employers to provide time off and accommodations for abortions under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The judge sided with conservative lawmakers and religious groups, arguing that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion as a pregnancy-related condition. This ruling has sparked controversy, with advocacy groups condemning it as an attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom, while conservative groups celebrate it as a victory for life. The decision comes amid broader changes at the EEOC under the Trump administration, potentially leading to a rewrite of the regulations. </p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is facing significant hurdles in the House of Representatives, with Republican dissidents raising concerns over several key issues.

Four right-wing lawmakers are withholding their support, arguing that the cuts should be steeper to avoid swelling America's public debt.
