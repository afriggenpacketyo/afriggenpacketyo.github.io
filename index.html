          <h2>RFK Jr.'s Wellness Farms: A Return to Outdated Mental Health Treatments?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-04 10:04:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s proposal for wellness farms as a primary mental health solution echoes historical, ultimately unsuccessful, "moral treatment" approaches.  This plan prioritizes natural remedies and manual labor, neglecting the complexities of psychiatric medication and community-based care.  The lack of robust evidence supporting care farms' effectiveness raises concerns about the plan's feasibility and potential harm.  The proposal also exhibits a concerning naturalness bias, downplaying the importance of proven treatments.</p>

          <h2>Jonathan Majors's Redemption Arc: Can Art Separate From Artist?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jonathan Majors's new film, "Magazine Dreams," explores themes of violence and male entitlement, mirroring controversies surrounding the actor's real-life legal battles.  The film's release has been overshadowed by Majors's public relations efforts to rehabilitate his image, raising questions about the separation of art from the artist.  Critics argue that Majors's lack of introspection regarding the film's themes undermines its impact. The film itself offers a compelling, albeit sometimes clumsy, exploration of toxic masculinity.</p>

          <p>China retaliated against President Trump's tariffs with its own 34% levy on all US imports, significantly escalating the trade war.  China also imposed export controls and added US companies to its sanctions lists.  This response indicates a hardening of positions and reduces the likelihood of a near-term resolution.
