          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price reductions on several of its electric and plug-in hybrid models. Analysts anticipate a surge in dealership visits due to these price cuts, but do not foresee significant market share erosion for BYD's competitors. The price reductions, affecting 22 models, are expected to stimulate sales growth in the new energy vehicle sector, particularly for vehicles priced below 200,000 Chinese yuan, where competition remains moderate. This move reflects the ongoing competition and potential price war in the Chinese automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Energy provider Octopus has apologized to a customer in Hartlebury, Worcestershire, after wrongly pursuing him for an outstanding gas bill of over Â£6,000 for nearly four years. Peter Holden, 67, repeatedly informed the company of the error, which stemmed from a data issue causing his meter to share a serial number with another account. Despite assurances and apologies from Octopus staff, the erroneous bills and debt collection attempts persisted, causing significant stress to Mr. Holden. The company has promised further staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future, with the commercial director personally apologizing and vowing to restore the customer's faith.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has passed away at the age of 97.

Ophuls directed several other documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," but "The Sorrow and the Pity" remained his most influential work, prompting critical reevaluation of France's wartime history.</p>

In addition to tariffs, the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, triggered by the 2021 coup, is expected to be a key discussion point, with leaders stressing the need for humanitarian assistance and greater international financial support for the region.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a revised rice sales system to reduce soaring prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via direct contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system that was seen as contributing to higher costs. The new measures also waive previous requirements for suppliers to return an equivalent amount of rice to the government. This action follows criticism of the government's previous efforts to control rice prices, with the public showing optimism that the new farm minister can effectively lower prices.

          <p>Businesses are utilizing a legal workaround called the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs, allowing U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the factory to the vendor. This rule, around since 1988, has gained traction amid recent tariff regimes, particularly for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products. Companies must meet specific criteria, including multiple sales, independent parties, proof of U.S. destination, and documentation of the first sale price.

          <p>China is set to launch the worldâ€™s first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, marking a significant step in reducing reliance on imported seafood through offshore aquaculture. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, built in Guangzhou, is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. The vessel can quickly relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery to domestic markets. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giants Tencent and Baidu are navigating U.S. chip restrictions to maintain their competitiveness in artificial intelligence. Strategies include stockpiling chips, enhancing AI model efficiency, and utilizing domestically produced semiconductors. Tencent emphasizes its substantial chip inventory and software optimization for efficient inferencing, while Baidu highlights its "full-stack" capabilities and progress in domestic AI chip development. These adaptations aim to mitigate the impact of U.S. curbs and foster long-term innovation within China's AI ecosystem.</p>

The electoral council claimed turnout was higher than 40 percent, although independent observers were absent, and the results were not posted online, contrasting with previous elections.</p>

          <p>The recent shift in tone from leaders in the UK and EU, condemning Israel's actions in Gaza as "morally unjustifiable," marks a departure from previous rhetoric. However, this condemnation has not translated into concrete action, leaving international organizations and courts powerless. The world continues to witness violations of morality and logic, with victims portrayed as aggressors and humanitarian efforts dismissed. Despite significant changes in public opinion and discourse, the lack of governmental action with leverage over Israel has failed to save lives.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving decades-long sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock, Arkansas. Hardin, who was sentenced to 30 years for first-degree murder and 50 years for a 1997 sexual assault, had been held at the facility since 2017. Corrections officials did not provide details about how he escaped, and law enforcement agencies are following leads to locate him.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep serves as the brain's natural mechanism for cleaning out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, found that hydrogen peroxide (Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions. This research opens new pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>
