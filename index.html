          <p>Shares of rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace surged in their Nasdaq debut, opening at $70 per share and valuing the company near $10 billion. The successful initial public offering, which raised $868 million, reflects growing investor interest in the space technology sector. Firefly has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, boasting a backlog of approximately $1.1 billion. The company's recent success includes a NASA-funded lunar landing and strong revenue growth, signaling a hot market for tech and space-related IPOs this year.</p>

The move follows Driscoll's short tenure as acting director while Kash Patel's nomination was under Senate consideration, raising questions about a potential shakeup within the agency's leadership.</p>

          <p>Senator John Cornyn announced that FBI Director Kash Patel has agreed to help find Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The Democrats fled to prevent a quorum, which is necessary for the Republican-led legislature to vote on new congressional maps that could significantly favor the GOP. Cornyn and Governor Greg Abbott have raised allegations of bribery against the lawmakers, citing donations funding their travel, while Democrats call the FBI's involvement an authoritarian overreach. The political standoff continues as Texas Republicans aim to pass the new maps ordered by President Trump, which could add up to five more GOP seats in Congress.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have fallen to their lowest average since May, making them an increasingly attractive borrowing option for homeowners. With the average rate now at 8.13%, HELOCs are currently cheaper than alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, personal loans, or credit cards. Financial experts suggest that with the Federal Reserve appearing likely to cut rates soon, the variable rates on HELOCs could decrease further, offering more savings. This contrasts with fixed-rate loans, which would not benefit from future market adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

However, he clarified in an interview that Israel does not want to permanently occupy or govern the territory. Instead, Netanyahu stated the goal is to establish a security perimeter and then transfer civilian governance to "Arab forces" that do not advocate for Israel's destruction. This plan is expected to face strong international opposition amid growing humanitarian concerns and stalled ceasefire negotiations with Hamas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to begin work on a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from its population count. This move would have significant repercussions, particularly on the apportionment of congressional seats and the redrawing of electoral districts. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of all persons every ten years, and previous attempts by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question were blocked by the Supreme Court. Critics argue that such a change would lead to a significant undercount of minority populations and is politically motivated.</p>

The unusual demand follows a letter from Republican Senator Tom Cotton raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments and leadership roles in companies with links to the Chinese military. Intel, a major recipient of U.S. government funding to boost domestic chip manufacturing, has defended its CEO, stating both are committed to U.S. national security.

This is a slight decrease from the May forecast but still points to a more active season than the 30-year average. Factors influencing the prediction include warmer-than-average ocean temperatures and a neutral El Niño phase, which can lead to more intense tropical storm development during the peak months from August to October.</p>

          <p>Over 60 countries are now responding to a new wave of U.S. tariffs that took effect on Thursday, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The "reciprocal" tariffs, announced by President Trump, have disrupted global trade systems and prompted warnings of job losses from industry groups worldwide. Nations like Brazil and Switzerland are developing contingency plans, with Brazil's president calling the duties "unacceptable blackmail." While some partners like the EU and UK secured deals to lower the impact, others face steep increases, leading to widespread economic uncertainty and a scramble to renegotiate terms with Washington.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially enacted a wide-ranging set of "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, with a baseline rate of 10% for most countries. However, specific rates vary significantly, with some nations like Brazil and India facing total tariffs of 50% due to separate geopolitical and trade issues. Key neighbors Mexico and Canada are subject to 25% and 35% levies, respectively. In contrast, China is currently under a temporary truce with a 30% tariff rate, while regions like the U.K. and the E.U. successfully negotiated frameworks to lessen the economic impact.

          <p>Police in the Kashmir region have raided book stores after the Indian government banned 25 books, including one by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy, for allegedly "exciting secessionism." The government claims the authors are misguiding youth against India, a move condemned by separatist leaders as authoritarian. The raids and ban come on the sixth anniversary of New Delhi stripping the region of its semi-autonomous status. This action is the latest in a series of government crackdowns in the disputed, Muslim-majority territory, aimed at suppressing dissent and promoting a nationalist narrative.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has emerged as the leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, according to prediction markets like Kalshi. His odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisors favor his data-driven approach to monetary policy. Waller, a Trump appointee, recently dissented on the Fed's decision to hold rates, arguing the stance was "overly cautious." His perceived dovishness and political independence have made him a popular choice among investors, surpassing previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, whom Trump had recently praised as strong candidates for the top role.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner draws parallels to a 1971 incident involving President Richard Nixon. While Nixon privately raged against BLS officials and harbored anti-Semitic conspiracies about them undermining his economic data, he never dared to publicly fire the bureau's chief. Nixon's actions were constrained by the political norms of his era and a desire to avoid public backlash. In contrast, Trump's public dismissal of the commissioner for producing "RIGGED" job numbers demonstrates a more brazen willingness to violate institutional norms and directly attack nonpartisan government functions.</p>

          <p>The political feud over Texas redistricting has intensified as a bomb threat forced the evacuation of a hotel where fleeing Democratic lawmakers were staying.

The Democrats are protesting what they call a gerrymandering attempt by Republicans to create up to five more GOP-leaning congressional seats. President Trump had previously suggested the FBI might need to get involved, a move Democrats have decried as an attempt to silence their dissent.</p>

The senators expressed concern that the bonus structure, which caps all hospitalizations regardless of necessity, could incentivize withholding critical care.
