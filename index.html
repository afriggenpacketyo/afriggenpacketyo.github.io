          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its intention to shift its primary listing to the U.S., a move perceived as a blow to the London Stock Exchange. The company plans to implement a dual listing, maintaining a secondary presence in London while prioritizing the U.S. market. This decision comes after Wise's initial listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2021, which was seen as a symbolic victory for the U.K. government's efforts to attract global tech companies. Concerns about London's liquidity and industry expertise have fueled doubts about its ability to compete with U.S. exchanges. </p>

These declines are also reflected in the platforms' Apple App Store rankings.

The border dispute between China and India largely froze bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached in October of the previous year.

          <p>Japanese police investigated over 1,300 cases of stalking in 2024, the highest number since the anti-stalking law was enacted in 2000. This increase of 260 cases from the previous year prompted the National Police Agency to instruct prefectural headquarters to improve coordination with local stations. The emphasis on stalking cases was heightened after the death of Asahi Okazaki, who had reported abuse from her former partner. A record 2,415 restraining orders were issued, and police received 19,567 stalking consultations.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims of the Boeing 737 Max crashes has criticized the deal between Boeing and the U.S. Justice Department as "morally repugnant." The deal allows Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution by paying $1.1 billion, including compensation to families and funds for improving compliance. The crashes, which killed 346 people, were linked to faulty flight control systems. Relatives of the victims will have the opportunity to appeal the deal when it is considered by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, accusing aides of a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's mental state. Trump's inquiry focuses on the use of an autopen to sign executive actions, suggesting that Biden's aides were wielding executive power without his full awareness. Biden has dismissed Trump's claims as "ridiculous" and aimed at distracting from his administration's policies. Scrutiny over Biden's mental and physical capacity intensified after a book alleged that his inner circle covered up his "physical deterioration" during his re-election campaign.</p>

However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive. The report suggests that China must choose between its coal-fired plants financed in Pakistan and the solar panels it sells, as both cannot succeed in the same market. Indigenous manufacturing is vital due to rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals.</p>

          <p>According to a guest essay in the New York Times, President Trump's tariffs are disrupting the global trading system and causing instability for businesses and consumers. These tariffs undermine trade and weaken economic ties, destabilizing international relations.

The piece concludes that the Trump tariffs will make the world a poorer and more perilous place.</p>
