          <p>Eli Lilly announced its diabetes drug Mounjaro demonstrated significant health benefits in a large-scale trial compared to its older drug, Trulicity. The study showed Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 8% and, more profoundly, lowered the rate of death from any cause by 16%. While the results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a primary treatment for Type 2 diabetes, its higher cost and slightly more prevalent side effects remain key considerations for doctors and insurers. The company plans to submit the data to regulators, potentially expanding its approved uses by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that artificial intelligence does not pose an imminent threat to the design software company. He argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. The company, which recently priced its IPO shares at $33, is valued at $19.3 billion after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory challenges. Field's comments contrast with the growing focus on superintelligence by other tech leaders like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The idea of a "carbon passport" is being discussed as a potential measure to combat the environmental impact of overtourism and transportation. This system would assign individuals an annual carbon allowance, tracking their footprint and potentially restricting travel, especially international flights, once their limit is exceeded. The concept echoes a 2008 U.K. parliamentary debate on personal carbon trading, where individuals would need to buy credits to exceed their allowance. Proponents argue such drastic changes are becoming inevitable as the negative environmental effects of tourism and transport continue to grow.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Apple's third-quarter earnings report, investors on the prediction platform Kalshi are placing wagers on the specific words that will be mentioned during the company's conference call. There is a high probability, priced at around 90%, that executives will discuss "China" and "Tariff," reflecting concerns over geopolitical tensions and trade policies. The focus stems from pressure on Apple to diversify its manufacturing away from China and the potential impact of tariffs on iPhone costs. This investor sentiment underscores the significant macroeconomic challenges the tech giant is currently navigating. (not investment advice)</p>

This change follows a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and reflects growing domestic pressure in the UK, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong among Labour supporters.

Park, who found his own path to faith after a difficult childhood, says he is more likely to find God in the hospital's hallways than in a church.

          <p>All 17 former members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), who were recently dismissed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have spoken out against the changes. In a commentary published in the New England Journal of Medicine, they warned that the rigorous, science-based process for vaccine recommendations is "rapidly eroding." They disputed Kennedy's claims of corruption and expressed concern that the new, inexperienced panel will undermine public trust. An HHS spokesperson defended the move, stating it was a "clean sweep" needed to restore confidence in vaccine science.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed support for Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence, calling it a wise move to build a "brain trust" for future innovation. His comments followed strong earnings reports from both Meta and Microsoft, which saw its market cap exceed $4 trillion after robust cloud business growth. Cramer also looked ahead to upcoming earnings from Apple and Amazon, expressing some caution about Apple due to tariff exposure but optimism for Amazon's cloud and advertising segments. He believes Meta's spending strategy, aimed at achieving "superintelligence," is a key driver of its current momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores impostor syndrome, the psychological phenomenon where high-achieving individuals doubt their skills and fear being exposed as a fraud. First identified in the 1970s, it particularly affects those in technical fields, perfectionists, and introverts. To combat these feelings, the article suggests three strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and joining a community of peers to share insecurities and realize such doubts are common. The author notes that genuinely feeling like an impostor is often a sign that you are not one.</p>

Raznatovic posted a photo of the meeting, hinting at "big plans" for the fall of 2026. The proposed league is envisioned as a touring model, similar to Formula 1, with teams playing in cities outside the United States and backed by significant international investment. While James's direct involvement is unconfirmed, the meeting suggests he has a strong interest in the venture, which could present a major alternative to the NBA.</p>

This growth has given the firm approximately 5,000 branches, the most of any U.S. bank, and a physical presence in all 48 contiguous states. The expansion strategy runs counter to the industry's long-term trend of branch closures, as JPMorgan aims to capture more deposits in fast-growing markets. The bank plans to open another 500 new locations by 2027, projecting its new branches will contribute over $160 billion in deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

This change avoids a potential return to court after plaintiff attorneys argued the initial rules were too restrictive.
