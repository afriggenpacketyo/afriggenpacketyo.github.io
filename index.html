          <p>The quantity of vacant homes in England is steadily increasing, with over 700,000 properties now empty, 264,884 of which are classified as long-term empty. This trend is causing distress in communities, as derelict properties can attract crime and create unsafe living conditions, as exemplified by a resident's experience in Bristol. Housing charities view these empty homes as a missed opportunity to address the nation's housing shortage and homelessness crisis. Local councils are seeking greater authority to take over and repurpose these abandoned properties to alleviate the strain on housing resources.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, a $15.5 billion project that will connect Sicily to the mainland. Poised to be the world's longest suspension bridge, it is designed to handle 6,000 cars per hour and 200 trains daily. The project faces significant opposition due to environmental concerns, the risk of seismic activity from the nearby Messina fault, and warnings from sociologists that such large-scale public works are vulnerable to infiltration by organized crime. Despite the criticism, construction is slated to begin in early 2026.</p>

          <p>Following an attempted carjacking and assault on a former government staffer, President Trump announced he is considering federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force. The president stated he might bring in the National Guard and that administration lawyers are studying the possibility of overturning the city's Home Rule Act. This move would revoke the limited self-governance D.C. has had for 50 years, placing its municipal functions under direct federal control. Critics argue the president is using an isolated incident as a pretext to exert political power over the overwhelmingly Democratic city.</p>

          <p>A grand jury has indicted the suspect in the shooting deaths of two Israeli Embassy staffers with federal hate crime charges, which could make him eligible for the death penalty. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, is accused of killing Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum in May. According to charging documents, Rodriguez told arresting officers, "I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza." The attack, which the U.S. Attorney is investigating as both a hate crime and terrorism, has drawn national attention amid the administration's push to expand capital punishment.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that people returned to live in Pompeii after its catastrophic destruction by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence suggests that survivors, and possibly others seeking shelter, established a precarious settlement among the ruins, which lasted until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried structures and salvaged valuable materials from the devastated city. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned, revealing a new chapter of informal reoccupation in the city's history.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests California Wildfires May Have Caused Hundreds More Deaths Than Officially Counted</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County could be far higher than official figures. Researchers estimate there were 440 more deaths than typically expected during the period of the fires, compared to the 31 deaths officially attributed to the blazes. The study argues that indirect factors, such as poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services, likely contributed to this significant increase in mortality. This highlights the challenge of quantifying the full, lingering health impact of major climate-driven disasters.</p>

          <p>This article marks the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with a visual comparison of the cities in 1945 and today. The bombings in August 1945 led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II but caused an estimated 210,000 deaths by the year's end. Once devastated landscapes of rubble, both cities have since been rebuilt into thriving metropolises. At a recent ceremony, Hiroshima's mayor expressed concern that current global conflicts threaten peace, disregarding the tragic lessons learned from the only use of nuclear weapons in history.</p>

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty announced a 30% drop in profits for its fiscal first quarter, attributing the decline to the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. With approximately 75% of its products sourced from China, the company has been significantly affected by the trade policy and has raised prices to offset costs. E.l.f. declined to provide a full-year revenue forecast due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation. Despite the profit decline, the company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share still managed to beat Wall Street expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking regulatory approval for a nearly $10 billion rate hike to be implemented over the next four years. FPL argues the increase is necessary to ensure grid reliability and invest in solar and battery storage facilities. However, environmental and consumer advocacy groups oppose the plan, claiming it would be the largest utility hike in U.S. history and would place a significant financial burden on vulnerable residents. Critics also allege the proposal is designed to boost shareholder profits rather than primarily serve infrastructure needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from Kharkiv, Ukraine, reveals that Western sanctions have not yet crippled Russia's ability to wage war, as evidenced by the remnants of advanced Russian weaponry. Prosecutors analyzing the wreckage of missiles and drones show that many contain Western components, indicating that Russia is successfully circumventing trade restrictions. This reality on the ground provides a stark contrast to diplomatic efforts, including President Trump's threats of increased sanctions. A local police colonel and civilians affected by the war express a desire for peace but remain skeptical that economic pressure alone will be effective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's strategic efforts to shift public focus away from his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It details three primary tactics: demanding his supporters dismiss the story as a "hoax," creating distractions with other policy announcements, and selectively releasing information that often raises more questions. The analysis suggests that these methods, while familiar for the president, have frequently backfired by inadvertently drawing more attention to the very subject he wishes to suppress. The piece explores the dynamic between the administration's messaging and media scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended $584 million in federal research grants for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing alleged civil rights violations. The administration accused the university of fostering a hostile environment for Jewish students and violating the equal protection clause. UCLA's chancellor warned that the suspension of funds from entities like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation would be devastating for life-saving research. This action marks a significant escalation in the administration's targeting of universities over issues of antisemitism and campus protests.</p>

Investigators used the manufacturing date of the boot to link the discovery to the 1997 cold case. White had disappeared during a solo fishing trip, with his empty boat found on the lake. DNA testing confirmed a parental match with his daughter, finally providing a degree of closure for the family and for the original search and rescue members involved in the case.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessory and jewelry chain popular with teenagers, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time since 2018. The company cited increased competition from online retailers like Shein and Temu, shifting consumer spending habits, and the overall decline of shopping malls as key factors. The filing also notes pressure from macroeconomic factors, including steep tariffs on goods sourced from China. While its North American stores are expected to remain open during the process, the bankruptcy highlights the severe challenges facing traditional brick-and-mortar retail. (not investment advice)</p>
