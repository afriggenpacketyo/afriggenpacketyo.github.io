The investigation began when ARI Bikes of Utah reported the theft of 337 bicycles valued at $1.7 million, leading to the identification of multiple suspects and warehouse locations. The suspects, Samvel Karapetyan, Vazgen Avagyan, Narek Badalyan, Vladimir Gyulankaryan, and Davit Grigoryan, were taken into custody, highlighting the growing sophistication of cargo theft in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy economics" with their welfare policy proposals. Badenoch's criticism centers on their approaches to the two-child benefit cap, with both leaders considering its removal. She argues that scrapping the cap would burden taxpayers with funding unlimited child support, claiming the country cannot afford their economic visions and deserves leaders who take economics seriously. Farage has stated his desire to lift the cap to ease the burden on lower-paid workers, while Starmer's government is also considering its removal, acknowledging the significant costs involved.</p>

This arrest follows the recent pre-trial detention of Zurab Japaridze, another leader from the same coalition, who refused to participate in a parliamentary inquiry. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of adopting authoritarian tactics similar to those employed by Moscow, moving the country away from its pro-Western stance and EU aspirations.

Musk's service ends after the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. During his tenure, DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though these figures have faced scrutiny. Despite criticism from Democrats in Congress, Musk's return to the private sector has been welcomed by markets, with Tesla shares rising on the news, indicating that he will now allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's four-month tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has concluded, marked by significant changes to federal spending and sparking considerable controversy. Musk aimed to cut federal spending, initially targeting $2 trillion before shifting to $175 billion in claimed savings through asset sales, lease cancellations, and workforce reductions. His presence in the White House raised concerns about conflicts of interest due to his companies' business dealings with the U.S. government, and his cuts to USAID programs aligned with the administration's "America First" approach. Musk also faced criticism for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation during his time in office.</p>

          <p>China has revealed the world’s first AI nuclear inspector, a technology that could enhance Beijing’s position in international disarmament discussions. Developed by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE), the project aims to improve the verification of nuclear warheads. The AI system faced challenges including training and testing with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the technology remains secure, and gaining international acceptance of the new verification methods. While the AI inspector is still in development, it signifies a major step forward for China's technological capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership due to ongoing dissatisfaction within the White House regarding the agency's arrest and deportation levels. Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, and Robert Hammer, who leads ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, has been reassigned. These changes aim to support the administration's mandate to increase arrests and deportations of unauthorized migrants, with Stephen Miller pushing for a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day. The agency views these realignments as crucial to achieving President Trump's objectives of enhancing community safety by removing criminal illegal aliens.</p>
