          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks saw their shares increase significantly after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger.

Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated the merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, though critics previously argued it suppressed shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is supporting collaboration where possible. Some universities are already delivering courses collaboratively to the benefit of students. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation.</p>
