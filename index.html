          <p>A major wildfire in Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire expanded rapidly, fueled by strong winds, and also caused a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility, complicating firefighting efforts. While all guests and staff were evacuated safely with no loss of life reported, the event marks a significant loss of state history. Concurrently, smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada is causing poor air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has launched a public defense of its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation, responding to escalating attacks from the Trump administration. The central bank created a "Frequently Asked Questions" webpage to counter claims of mismanagement and extravagance, particularly from OMB Director Russell Vought. The page clarifies that costs increased due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes, not for "VIP dining rooms" as alleged. This public pushback signifies the Fed's resistance to political pressure as the administration continues its campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions with the Trump administration, speculation has emerged about whether Elon Musk might relocate more of his tech empire's operations to China. This consideration follows criticism from Donald Trump regarding the substantial government subsidies Musk's companies have received. According to Denis Simon, a fellow at the Quincy Institute, escalating conflicts over regulation or taxation could prompt Musk to leverage China's advanced supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. The article notes Musk's businesses have benefited from approximately $38 billion in U.S. government support.</p>

In an interview, he stated, "I made every single one of those," dismissing claims from conservatives as politically motivated lies.

          <p>Katie Wallis, a former Conservative MP for Bridgend who was the first in the UK to openly transition while in office, has been sentenced for harassing her ex-wife. Wallis received a 12-month community order, a fine, and a restraining order after sending unwanted and abusive messages, including a demand for money. In a victim impact statement, her ex-wife described being left "drowning in chaos" and emotionally destroyed by the harassment. The court heard that Wallis was experiencing profound difficulties related to her gender transition at the time of the offenses.</p>

          <p>A violent series of events in Lexington, Kentucky, ended with two women shot and killed at a Baptist church. The incident began when a suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. The gunman, identified as 47-year-old Guy House, killed two women, aged 72 and 32, and wounded two other men before being shot and killed by police. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>This article provides a brief history of queerness, tracing its varied acceptance and persecution from antiquity to the modern era. It notes that while figures like Leonardo da Vinci faced scrutiny, same-sex relationships were common in ancient Greece and Rome, albeit with specific social hierarchies. The spread of Christianity introduced centuries of stigmatization and punishment, contrasting with more relaxed attitudes in places like samurai-era Japan. The article also highlights the long-standing existence of third-gender identities in various cultures and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights, emphasizing that these hard-won achievements require continuous protection.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting it could be transformed into a mutually-owned business. This proposal, which would give employees a greater stake in the organization, aims to reform the Post Office's culture following the Horizon IT scandal that led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also review the necessity of maintaining 11,500 branches and what future services, particularly banking, should be offered. The goal is to create a fresh vision for the financially struggling but socially valuable institution.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a temporary hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Wiltshire, effective July 22. The restriction follows a period of prolonged dry weather and increased customer demand that has strained water supplies. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. The move comes as the Environment Agency declared a state of prolonged dry weather in the region, and other water companies have already implemented similar measures.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece challenges the characterization of the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement as a centrist or conservative scheme. The author argues that advocating for fewer building restrictions is a progressive, populist effort akin to trust-busting, aimed at breaking the "housing cartel" of wealthy landowners who use zoning laws to create artificial scarcity and inflate their property values. The article contends that NIMBYism is the truly conservative project, preserving an unfair status quo that worsens the cost-of-living crisis, climate outcomes, and segregation, ultimately hurting progressive values.</p>

The EU has temporarily suspended its own retaliatory tariffs as a goodwill gesture to facilitate talks before the deadline. The potential U.S. tariffs could impact a vast range of European exports and destabilize economies across the trading bloc. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece specifically criticizes plans to cut funding for FEMA's pre-disaster mitigation and NOAA's climate research.

Proponents argue the policy would improve financial security for families and childcare workers, boost the city's economy, and build on the success of its universal pre-K program.

          <p>Despite modern advancements like comfortable beds and climate control eliminating historical sleep threats, many people still struggle with poor sleep. This article explores the paradox of modern sleep, where new obstacles have replaced old ones. Modern lifestyles, marked by stress, demanding work schedules, and constant screen time, disrupt natural sleep patterns. Furthermore, systemic issues like noise and light pollution, housing insecurity, and the stress of discrimination disproportionately affect sleep quality in marginalized communities, creating significant sleep health disparities that technology alone cannot solve.</p>
