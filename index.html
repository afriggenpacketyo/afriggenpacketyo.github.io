          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an exclusive interview, rating the meeting a "10" for rapport. He stated that while significant progress was made, there is "no deal until there's a deal," placing the onus on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European nations to finalize any agreement. Trump also reiterated his belief that the war in Ukraine would not have occurred under his presidency and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal" to end the conflict.</p>

While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the United States, its path is projected to pass north of the Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing risks of heavy rainfall and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old student at Seminole High School was arrested and charged with battery following a large fight on campus. A security guard provided a sworn statement claiming the student, Tyshawn Ellison, pushed and physically assaulted her, which led to the arrest. However, the student's mother disputes this account, asserting that video footage recorded by other students contradicts the guard's claim and shows her son was not the aggressor in that specific interaction. The case is now being handled by Sanford police.</p>

The compromised data, affecting individuals who arrived between January and March 2024, includes names, passport details, and relocation assistance policy numbers. This incident follows a previous major data leak in 2022, raising serious concerns among advocacy groups about the safety of Afghans who worked with British forces and their families who may still be at risk.</p>

          <p>The high-stakes summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a tangible agreement to end or pause the war in Ukraine. Despite Trump's claims of a "very productive" meeting, the lack of specifics and the absence of a press conference left allies and analysts to conclude that he left empty-handed. The meeting was seen by some as a strategic win for Putin, who was granted a high-profile diplomatic event on US soil without offering any clear concessions, leaving the future of the conflict uncertain.</p>

Under the revised arrangement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, contrary to an initial order that would have placed a DEA administrator in charge.

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of murder and sexual assault, meticulously planned his prison escape over six months. The report states Hardin exploited lax security in the prison kitchen to create a fake law enforcement uniform and other supplies needed for his breakout. Two employees have been fired and several others disciplined for procedural violations, including a guard who opened a gate for Hardin without verifying his identity, highlighting significant security failures at the facility.</p>

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin concluded without a ceasefire or any tangible deal, leaving observers to analyze the vague pronouncements of "great progress." For Trump, who prides himself on deal-making, the outcome appears to be a diplomatic setback, as he traveled a great distance for an ambiguous result. From the Russian perspective, Putin secured a high-profile meeting on American soil without making clear concessions, effectively maintaining his strategic position regarding the conflict in Ukraine while placing the onus for next steps back on the US.</p>

          <h2>China's Multi-Billion Dollar Bubble Tea Industry Faces Questions of Long-Term Sustainability</h2>

          <p>The global bubble tea market, dominated by rapidly expanding Chinese chains like Mixue Group, is projected to grow into a nearly $5 billion industry by 2032. Several of these companies have recently gone public in Hong Kong, raising hundreds of millions from investors betting on China's consumer market. Their business model relies heavily on franchising, which fuels explosive growth but also presents challenges in maintaining quality control and avoiding market saturation. The industry now faces a test of whether it can sustain its momentum or if it is a fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps in a bid to gain up to five U.S. House seats. The proposal, which would require voter approval in a special election, is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas and aims to protect the Democratic party's chances of controlling Congress. The new maps would override the state's independent redistricting commission, concentrating Republican voters into fewer districts and creating more favorable conditions for Democratic candidates across the state.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator in the crowd at Anfield. The referee, Anthony Taylor, stopped play for four minutes to address the situation with both managers and captains, and an anti-discrimination message was later read to the crowd. Despite the distressing incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals in the match, with football authorities and both clubs condemning the abuse and launching a full investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's opening Premier League match was marked by emotional tributes to former forward Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash in July. Before the game against Bournemouth, fans in the Kop held up a mosaic in his honor, and his family was in attendance at Anfield. Players and fans sang his song throughout the match, and Mohamed Salah, who was visibly emotional, replicated Jota's signature celebration after scoring a late goal. The club will also feature a "Forever 20" emblem on player shirts throughout the season to honor his memory.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after the Chinese government complained about works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. The show's Burmese curator, who has since fled to the UK to seek asylum, alleges that Chinese embassy officials pressured the gallery, through Thai authorities, to remove sensitive artworks and cover up references to Tibet and Xinjiang. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an example of China's transnational repression and an infringement on freedom of expression in another sovereign nation.</p>

Prosecutors stated the pair would provide fake wire transfer receipts to victims as supposed proof of payment. Kingston's mother was previously sentenced to five years for her part in the scheme.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting its new electric pickup truck as a highly affordable, American-made EV, with a business model focused on simplicity and customization. The base model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can modify with over 100 planned accessories or third-party add-ons. The company's main selling point is its low price, which it claims will remain competitive even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, analysts question if the barebones truck can compete with similarly priced conventional vehicles that offer more standard features. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced a joint resolution to end former President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force. Citing the Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that Trump has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required to justify such an unprecedented move. Lawmakers contend that the only emergency is a political one of Trump's own making and that his actions are an egregious attack on the city's autonomy and have actually worsened public safety by disrupting local law enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>Scottish jazz pianist Fergus McCreadie initially dismissed calls from director Spike Lee's team as spam before realizing the acclaimed filmmaker genuinely wanted him to work on a new movie. McCreadie and his jazz trio were flown to New York to record music for the crime thriller "Highest 2 Lowest," starring Denzel Washington. Lee had personally flown to Edinburgh to watch McCreadie perform after hearing his music. The pianist's track "Stony Gate" is featured prominently in the film's score, marking a surreal and major career opportunity for the musician.</p>
