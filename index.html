          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers selected Kyle Kennard, the SEC's top defensive player, in the fourth round of the NFL draft, aiming to inject youth into their edge rusher unit. Kennard, known for his impressive stats at South Carolina, joins a Chargers team undergoing transition, marked by the departure of Joey Bosa and the aging of veterans like Khalil Mack and Bud Dupree. The team anticipates a significant contribution from Tuli Tuipulotu, a rising star, as they reshape their defensive strategy for the upcoming season.

          <p>Despite plans for a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's crimes in Ukraine, various hindrances remain, including the immunity of acting heads of state like Vladimir Putin. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leadership, it lacks the UN Security Council's power to waive immunity. The tribunal's scope, including the period it will consider and the individuals it will target, is still being defined. Political will for the tribunal is also uncertain, with some countries potentially withdrawing support, raising concerns about its effectiveness in holding Russia accountable.</p>
