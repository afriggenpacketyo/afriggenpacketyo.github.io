          <p>European officials are expressing optimism about reaching a trade agreement with the U.S., while cautioning that the imposition of tariffs would significantly harm both European and American economies. Negotiations are ongoing to avert U.S. tariffs on EU goods and subsequent countermeasures, but tangible compromises remain elusive. The EU insists that its overall trade with the U.S. is reasonably balanced, despite a goods surplus and a services deficit. Officials emphasize the importance of open dialogue to protect the substantial daily trade between the two regions, with some criticizing tariffs as detrimental to consumers and investment.

          <p>Gold prices are surging as trade tensions drive investors towards the safe-haven asset, while U.S. Treasurys and the dollar experience a sell-off. The shift in U.S. trade policy under President Trump is diminishing the safe-haven appeal of U.S. assets, prompting investors to seek alternatives like gold. Analysts predict further rallies in gold prices, citing its inflation-hedging qualities and independence from any single nation's economic or political trajectory. The weakening dollar is also making gold more attractive to holders of other currencies, contributing to the diversification drive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, has reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose approximately 42% year-on-year, while operating profit surged 158%. The company, however, warned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, could create demand volatility impacting the second half of the year. Despite these concerns, SK Hynix anticipates that demand from consumer electronics will benefit from new products featuring AI functionalities, expecting Big Tech's spending on AI to continue fueling memory demand.</p>

          <p>China is reshaping the global scientific publishing landscape through changes to its journal ranking system, according to experts. The updated Journal Ranking Table by the Chinese Academy of Sciences now plays a crucial role in China's research evaluation system, influencing researcher output and promotions. Recent updates have seen some established international journals downgraded, while domestic Chinese journals have improved in rankings.

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, becoming the latest former leader to face criminal trial in the country. The charges relate to the employment of his former son-in-law at a budget airline in Thailand, where prosecutors allege he received undue compensation. Prosecutors contend that the money was a bribe paid to Moon by a businessman who controlled the airline, given the son-in-law's lack of qualifications for the position. Moon's indictment adds to a recurring pattern of criminal investigations targeting former leaders in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny for using the encrypted messaging app Signal on a computer in his Pentagon office, a move that circumvents restrictions on personal cellphones in certain areas. This arrangement facilitated easier communication in a building with poor cell service. Hegseth had cables installed to connect a private computer to Signal, raising concerns about security protocols and the potential for unsecured communications within the Department of Defense.</p>
