          <p>The NHS app in England will be expanded to include more test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders, aiming to become the default communication method for patients. This Â£50 million investment is projected to save the health service Â£200 million over the next three years by reducing reliance on traditional methods like letters. While those without app access will still receive texts and letters, the move is intended to free up NHS phone lines and provide patients with better access to manage their healthcare. The NHS app, launched in 2018, is currently used in 87% of hospitals across England and sees over 11 million monthly logins.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has recovered the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai farmworker who was taken hostage and killed by a militant group in Gaza. Pinta was working in southern Israel when he was kidnapped during the Hamas-led attack in October 2023. The recovery operation took place in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, and the IDF stated that the mission was launched following information obtained from interrogating a captured terrorist. Mr. Nattapong is believed to be the last remaining Thai national abducted during the October 2023 attack.</p>

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after over three years of combating Islamic extremists, though Russia's mercenary presence will continue through the Africa Corps. The Africa Corps, under the Russian defense ministry's command, will focus on training, equipment provision, and protection services, a shift from Wagner's combat role. Wagner's withdrawal follows accusations of targeting civilians and heavy losses in recent attacks by al-Qaida-linked groups. The transition indicates a potential change in Russia's strategy in Mali, moving towards a lighter footprint with a greater emphasis on training and support rather than direct combat operations.</p>

The investigation aims to determine how classified strike details ended up on the commercial messaging app Signal. Investigators are also looking into whether any staff were instructed to delete messages, as the government is legally obligated to retain federal communications as official records.

          <p>Japan and the European Union are preparing to launch a "Japan-EU Competitiveness Alliance" to enhance their companies' competitiveness through trade and economic security cooperation. This initiative aims to address concerns over U.S. tariffs and Chinese trade practices. The alliance is expected to be announced at a summit meeting in July, with plans to diversify supply chains for rare earth minerals and align subsidy conditions for environmental technology. The two sides will also seek to promote reform of the World Trade Organization and collaborate with emerging economies.</p>
