          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian commercial port near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least eight fatalities and over 750 injuries. The blast caused widespread damage, shattering windows and destroying nearby buildings and vehicles, with residents reporting the impact felt up to 50km away. Initial reports suggested the fire originated from improperly stored flammable materials, possibly related to solid fuel for ballistic missiles. Authorities are investigating the incident, with schools and offices closed in the region as a precaution, with officials having previously warned the port regarding safe chemical storage.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has voiced concerns about Vladimir Putin's commitment to ending the war in Ukraine following a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Pope Francis's funeral. Trump noted recent Russian strikes on Kyiv, suggesting Putin might not be serious about peace. Despite earlier optimism after talks between Trump's envoy and Putin, the attacks have led Trump to reconsider Russia's intentions and consider alternative strategies involving banking or secondary sanctions. This marks a shift in Trump's perspective, who had previously blamed Ukraine for the conflict and accused Zelenskyy of hindering negotiations.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in Americans' faith in Donald Trump across key issues, with a majority describing his second term as "scary." Low approval ratings on the economy and immigration policy contribute to his historically low popularity early in his term. Even among Republicans, there is a lack of overwhelming confidence in Trump's priorities, while independent voters express significant disapproval. The polls also indicate widespread concern about the economy, trade policies, and immigration, with younger generations particularly critical of Trump's handling of economic issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been accused of deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen and the mother of a one-year-old girl, raising concerns about due process and family separation. Lawyers in both cases allege that their clients were arrested during routine check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and given limited opportunities to communicate with family or legal counsel. The incidents highlight the administration's crackdown on immigrants, including documented individuals and citizens, leading to legal challenges and accusations of violating constitutional rights.</p>
