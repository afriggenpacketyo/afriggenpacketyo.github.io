          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reportedly conducted a major drone operation targeting four Russian military airfields, claiming to have struck over 40 military aircraft. The governors of the Irkutsk and Murmansk regions confirmed drone attacks in their areas, with videos showing strikes on Olenya airbase and Belaya airfield, both housing strategic bomber aircraft. Additionally, a railway bridge collapsed in Russia's Bryansk region, resulting in casualties, while a second railway bridge collapsed in the Kursk region. Meanwhile, Ukraine reported a large-scale Russian aerial attack, launching hundreds of drones and missiles into the country. The current state of affairs in the region reflects ongoing tensions and military operations. Optimism is limited given the loss of life and the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain (PSG) secured their first Champions League title, defeating Inter Milan 5-0 in a dominant final performance. PSG's victory marks the first for a French team since 1993, but it also highlights the financial disparities within the competition, as PSG's starting lineup cost significantly more to assemble than Inter's. While the new Champions League format aims for greater diversity, concerns remain about whether it simply replicates a European Super League in terms of financial dominance. Football finance experts note that PSG's high wage bill made their success somewhat expected.</p>

Witnesses reported fire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli army stated it was unaware of injuries caused by its fire within the aid distribution site. The incident occurred amidst faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with both sides trading blame for the lack of progress. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated it delivered aid without incident and dismissed reports of deaths and injuries around its sites, although previous GHF distributions have been marked by chaos and reports of Israeli troops firing on crowds.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. The technology has potential applications in surgery, encryption, and rescue operations, although questions remain about its practical benefits compared to existing night vision devices.</p>
