          <p>Analysts are finding it difficult to predict how the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran will affect oil prices, especially with the potential for direct U.S. involvement and major supply disruptions such as Iran potentially blocking the Strait of Hormuz. Oil prices have fluctuated recently as markets assess the risk of further attacks on critical energy infrastructure. The chief executives of TotalEnergies, Shell, and EnQuest have warned that further attacks on energy infrastructure could significantly impact global supply and prices. Stephen Schork of The Schork Report suggests a significant escalation could substantially increase oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a school shooting in Graz where a gunman killed 10 people, Austria is planning to tighten its gun control laws. The proposed reforms include raising the minimum age for purchasing dangerous firearms from 21 to 25 and extending the waiting period between purchase and receipt of a firearm to four weeks. The government also intends to enhance psychological testing for gun owners and increase the number of school psychologists to identify potential dangers early. The assailant had previously failed a psychological screening for military service, prompting the government to improve data transfer between the armed forces and firearm regulatory agencies.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged with killing a Minnesota state representative and her husband and wounding another state senator and his wife, was described as a frustrated idealist. According to Charlie Kalech, who worked with Boelter on web design projects, Boelter was deeply religious and passionate about solving societal problems. Boelter's writings and presentations detailed sweeping proposals to address issues like American hunger, reflecting his frustration with perceived injustices. The projects, often grand in scale, never fully materialized, leaving Boelter seemingly disillusioned before the alleged violent rampage.</p>

          <p>The Premier League has issued a warning about potential fixture changes at short notice due to the increased number of teams participating in European competitions. With nine teams in Europe, including six in the Champions League, there is a higher likelihood of Premier League games being moved after the initial fixture announcements. This is especially true if clubs progress to the knockout rounds of these competitions. The league will need to juggle TV fixtures, considering which Champions League representatives will play on Tuesdays and therefore cannot play in the coveted Sunday TV slot the previous weekend.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce the impact of tariffs by modifying products to fit into lower-tariff categories. This involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to reclassify finished products under different harmonized system codes. Some companies are bundling or removing elements to qualify for lower duties based on specific exemptions. While legal, this practice allows businesses to strategically design products to minimize tariff liabilities, and is one of the few things businesses can do to try to get it right and reduce duty liability.

          <p>The UK Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, barring women in England and Wales from being investigated, arrested, or imprisoned for terminating their pregnancies. This represents the biggest reform to British abortion laws in nearly 60 years, although abortion is still regulated in clinical settings and assisting a woman in getting a late-term abortion can still be prosecuted. The new law aims to provide care and support to women rather than criminalization, according to MP Tonia Antoniazzi. The law now needs approval in the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent attack on Iran's nuclear program has raised speculation about the potential use of the U.S. GBU-57 bunker-buster bomb. The bomb is capable of penetrating 200 feet deep to reach Iran's Fordo facility, where enriched uranium is believed to be stored. The weapon, which has never been used in combat, is designed to target underground facilities protected by thick concrete. While it contains only 5,000 pounds of explosives, its penetration capability is crucial for damaging the facility and its centrifuges.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III revealed his surprise at the amount of taxes taken from his $14 million signing bonus, receiving only $6.9 million. He highlighted the lack of financial literacy among rookie athletes, who are often unprepared to manage large sums of money. Griffin's experience underscores the importance of financial education, as many individuals lack essential financial skills, leading to debt and financial vulnerability. Financial literacy is a valuable skill for all, regardless of income level.</p>
