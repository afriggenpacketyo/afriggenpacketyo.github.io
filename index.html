          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, one aimed at high-value political donors and the other at memecoin millionaires, with the goal of raising millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, will feature David Sacks, who is influencing crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will grant access based on $TRUMP token holdings, with top holders promised dinner with Trump. Accountable.US has criticized the leaderboard contest as a corrupt scheme that could allow wealthy donors, possibly including foreign actors, to buy access to the president, while enriching the Trump family.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' forecast. The decision follows a similar increase in May, adding over 800,000 barrels per day to the market over two months. This surge in supply, coupled with concerns about a potential recession due to U.S. tariffs, has led to a decline in oil prices. Goldman Sachs has lowered its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year, and oilfield service firms anticipate a decrease in exploration and production investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest increase in tensions between the U.S. and Iran has brought attention to the difficulties the U.S. faces in stopping Iran's oil exports to China. Despite U.S. sanctions, Iran continues to export a significant amount of crude oil, primarily to China, using clandestine methods to evade detection. Experts say that the US has lost leverage over China due to tariff wars, diminishing the impact of financial sanctions. The article notes that tracking these shipments is technically challenging, and regional cooperation is complicated by political and economic alignments.</p>

While a rate cut is unlikely for May, any hints from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell about future cuts in June could cause lenders to preemptively lower rates. Inflation is cooling and unemployment is steady, possibly motivating the Fed to cut rates before summer.

          <p>The Trump administration is restarting student loan collections for millions of borrowers in default, amidst significant changes and disruptions to the lending system. Borrowers may face plan changes and long waits for assistance, with some reporting hours-long hold times. Borrowers in default could see their credit scores decline, leading to higher borrowing costs. The timing of staff layoffs at the Education Department is considered unfortunate given the increased need for borrower assistance.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's new regional security model aims to establish China as a regional security provider while excluding external interference, particularly from the US. The model, echoing Xi's 2014 call for Asian self-management of security, capitalizes on regional doubts about Washington's reliability. Analysts caution that China's efforts face challenges due to territorial disputes with neighbors and escalating rivalry with the US. Xi's recent tour of Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia positioned China as a stable partner, urging resistance to "unilateral bullying".</p>
