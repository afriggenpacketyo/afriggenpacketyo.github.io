          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claiming to target terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan described the strikes as "unprovoked," with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowing retaliation. Pakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims. Pakistan's military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 26 people were killed and 46 injured.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has implemented several measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster its economy amid trade war concerns. The People's Bank of China is cutting short-term interest rates and the amount of funds banks have to hold in reserve in a series of 10 measures. The move aims to stabilize markets and support key sectors like technology and real estate, while attracting foreign investment. These measures come as top officials from the Trump administration are scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts this week during a trip to Geneva.</p>
