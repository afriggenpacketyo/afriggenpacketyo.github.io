As their numbers dwindle, museums and individuals like 12-year-old Shun Sasaki are committed to preserving and sharing the harrowing experiences of the attack. Sasaki, whose great-grandmother succumbed to radiation-related cancer, guides foreign tourists through the Peace Memorial Park, stressing that understanding the past is crucial to preventing future nuclear conflicts. The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum also launched an international campaign to convey the reality and enduring impact of the atomic bombs across generations, underscoring the vital need for global peace and nuclear disarmament.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan. Their absence broke the House quorum, stalling the legislative session and prompting a Republican-backed motion for their civil arrests. This escalating standoff, aimed at adding five Republican-leaning seats, has led Abbott to threaten their removal from office. Democrats, however, defend their quorum break as a constitutionally protected tool to protest what they view as a "racist gerrymandered map" and prevent the silencing of Texans' voices in the redistricting process.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed an emergency petition with the Texas Supreme Court, seeking to remove Democratic Representative Gene Wu from office, calling him the "ringleader" of the lawmakers who fled the state to block a redistricting vote. Abbott claims Wu and other absent Democrats have "abandoned their office," justifying their removal and alleging potential bribery for their actions. Wu, however, asserts that denying the governor a quorum was a "fulfillment of my oath" to the Constitution, not an abandonment of duty. This legal action further escalates the intense political showdown over the proposed congressional maps, which would create five new Republican-leaning seats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Norco state correctional facility, housing nearly 3,000 inmates, is slated for closure by fall 2026, driven by a declining prison population and an estimated $150 million in annual state savings. Inmates will be transferred, and the state plans to assist the 1,200 staff members with new placements. This closure continues a trend of correctional facility shutdowns, reflecting a statewide drop in crime rates and the impact of criminal justice reforms like Proposition 57. The future of the Norco site, once a luxury hotel and later a Naval hospital, remains uncertain, with local officials hoping for its restoration as a resort.</p>

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have been subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee as part of its ongoing investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Committee Chairman James Comer issued the subpoenas, seeking information about Epstein's history, especially after the Trump administration declined to release more federal files. This bipartisan committee action, driven by public outrage, aims to oversee the federal government's enforcement of sexual assault laws and its handling of the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell investigations. Bill Clinton's past travels on Epstein's private jet and meetings are specifically cited, bringing their long-questioned relationship back into public scrutiny and demanding transparency.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is terminating 22 federal contracts worth nearly $500 million for mRNA-based vaccine development. Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, cited claims that "mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses," despite widespread scientific consensus on their efficacy. This decision, impacting major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna, is criticized by health experts who warn it could jeopardize the nation's ability to respond to future pandemics.

          <p>The US Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California, Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, with illegally shipping tens of millions of dollars' worth of advanced AI chips, including Nvidia H100 GPUs, to China. The duo allegedly exported these sensitive technologies without required licenses from October 2022 through July 2025, evading US export controls. Law enforcement seized phones revealing communications about using Malaysia as a transshipment point to conceal illicit shipments. Nvidia stated that smuggling is a "nonstarter" and diverted products would lack support, emphasizing compliance with export rules.</p>

          <p>Parts of Australia's Great Barrier Reef have suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). Both northern and southern branches experienced widespread coral bleaching, primarily due to heat stress driven by climate change, compounded by cyclones and starfish outbreaks. AIMS warns the reef may reach a tipping point where coral cannot recover quickly enough between catastrophic events, facing a "volatile" future. Efforts to cull crown-of-thorns starfish have shown some success, but the overall outlook remains concerning.</p>

They believe this aligns with the national strategy to expand domestic demand and improve ordinary people's lives. Conversely, some argue that such specific metrics are not operationally feasible as direct policy goals, highlighting a significant point of contention among influential thinkers regarding China's future economic blueprint.

Four other defendants have reached plea agreements.</p>

          <p>The Charity Commission has found no evidence of widespread bullying or harassment at Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, following whistleblower allegations. While no sanctions were imposed, the commission criticized "all parties" for allowing a "damaging" public dispute that harmed the charity's reputation. It issued a regulatory action plan to address "governance weaknesses" and a lack of clarity over roles. Prince Harry, who resigned earlier this year, expressed that the report "falls troublingly short" in holding the current chair accountable, despite the charity's stated good financial health and continued mission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US border agents have been directed to cease deportations under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, following a federal appeals court order. The ruling found that while the proclamation could pause asylum access, it could not disregard laws protecting migrants from persecution or torture if deported. This effectively lifts a policy that had summarily deported migrants entering illegally. While the Justice Department could appeal to the Supreme Court, officials are now processing migrants under mechanisms that allow asylum requests, though those caught crossing illegally will likely remain detained, marking a shift in border enforcement.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, the rookie quarterback, is slated to start for the Cleveland Browns in their preseason opener against the Carolina Panthers. This decision comes despite Sanders being listed as QB4 on the unofficial depth chart and the team signing free agent Tyler Huntley. Injuries to fellow quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, coupled with veteran Joe Flacco's limited need for preseason reps, open this opportunity for Sanders. After a prolific college career under his father, Deion Sanders, this start provides a crucial chance for the fifth-round pick to prove his capabilities and battle for a roster spot.</p>

          <p>The US Coast Guard's extensive report on the Titan submersible tragedy concludes that OceanGate, the owner, used "intimidation tactics" to "evade regulatory scrutiny" before the fatal June 2023 implosion that killed five people. The investigation found the submersible's design and testing were inadequate, and the company continued operations despite hull damage. The report criticizes OceanGate's "toxic" safety culture, where employees faced threats for raising concerns. Had CEO Stockton Rush survived, the Coast Guard would have recommended a criminal investigation for negligence. The findings aim to provide lessons to prevent future occurrences in the deep-sea exploration industry.</p>

          <p>Flea-borne typhus infections are on the rise in parts of Southern California, particularly Los Angeles and Orange counties, with cases peaking in late summer and fall. The disease, caused by bacteria spread by infected fleas from rats, opossums, and stray cats, has led to 79 reported cases in LA County this year. Public health officials advise preventative measures, including keeping pets indoors, using flea control, securing trash, and sealing home openings to deter rodents and strays. Symptoms include fever and rash, and while rare, deaths have occurred in adults with underlying conditions, emphasizing the need for prompt medical attention.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire is raging through the Corbieres hills in southwestern France, having already spread over 11,000 hectares, injuring seven firefighters and two civilians, one critically. The blaze, which started in Ribaute, has forced partial evacuations of campgrounds and a village, and led to the closure of sections of the A9 motorway linking France to Spain. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that all national resources are mobilized to combat the rapidly spreading fire. Unfavorable weather conditions, including dryness and strong winds, are exacerbating the challenge for the more than 1,200 firefighters and water bomber planes deployed.</p>
