          <p>A bronze sculpture representing the attempted assassination of President Trump was displayed in the Oval Office. The sculpture portrays the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired near him in Butler, PA. The image became a symbol of Trump's resilience and bravery during the 2024 presidential election. The sculpture is believed to be a maquette for a larger statue planned by the Trump Statue Project, which aims to honor the president with a nine-foot replica symbolizing unity and resilience.</p>

          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital reached a settlement agreement totaling almost a billion dollars to compensate victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden, who sexually assaulted hundreds of women over two decades. Victims, including Evelyn Yang, wife of Andrew Yang, question how Hadden was able to continue his crimes for so long. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them. The victims' attorney emphasized holding institutions accountable for protecting serial predators rather than patients, while Columbia stated its commitment to repair harm and support survivors.</p>

Faculty members express anxiety over the growing repression and are seeking solidarity among universities to combat these challenges.

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he helped popularize the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," and emphasizes that predicting public appetite is impossible. He argues that relying solely on data can harm instinct and narrow the sieve for good ideas. Diller illustrates his point with examples like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were successful because of their compelling stories, not extensive research.</p>

Lee spent significant resources to recreate the feel of a cinematic epic, with flashbacks to Malcolm's childhood and his conversion to the Nation of Islam. The climactic assassination scene was filmed at the Hotel Diplomat, and Lee used dialogue, music, and camera work to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death.</p>

However, the California fish and game commission is conducting a review of these MPAs, considering proposals to either expand or reduce protections. Scientists and conservationists hope the abundance that has flourished here proves the value of preservation, while commercial fishers are less keen on seeing their rights to more marine areas revoked.</p>
