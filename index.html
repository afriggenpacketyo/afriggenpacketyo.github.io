          <h2>Pentagon Assessment Contradicts Trump's Claims on Iran Nuclear Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 17:38:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Pentagon intelligence assessment indicates that the recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities did not completely destroy the country's nuclear program, contrary to President Trump's claims. The assessment suggests the strikes only set back the program by a few months, with most centrifuges remaining intact and the impact limited to aboveground structures. Sources familiar with the assessment told CBS that some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. The White House disputes the assessment, but the report suggests that Iran could resume its nuclear program relatively quickly after repairs. Optimism is tempered by the discrepancy between the President's statements and the intelligence community's findings.</p>

          <p>Representative Brittany Pettersen brought her 5-month-old son, Sam, to a House Committee on Financial Services hearing, where she questioned Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about monetary policy. Pettersen, who is on the waitlist for childcare, balanced her congressional duties with caring for her son, who was dressed in a yellow onesie. Powell acknowledged Sam at the end of Pettersen's questioning, thanking him along with the congresswoman. Pettersen has been advocating for parental privileges for members of Congress, stating that the institution was not designed for women, as she is only the 13th House member to give birth while in office.</p>

With the victory, Benfica topped Group C and advanced to the last 16, where they will face either Chelsea or Esperance de Tunis. Bayern, having already secured a spot in the next round, fielded a rotated lineup that lacked urgency, though they improved in the second half, a Kimmich goal was disallowed due to an offside.</p>

          <p>Four members of a northern California family, including DoorDash executive Josh Pickles, were among the eight people who died in a boating accident on Lake Tahoe during a sudden thunderstorm. The 27-foot boat capsized near DL Bliss State Park due to high winds and waves, surprising even forecasters. Two people were rescued immediately after the incident, while the bodies of the other victims were recovered over the following days. The intensity of the storm, combined with unusually cold temperatures, contributed to the unstable air mass, making this boating accident a rare tragedy with multiple fatalities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a cease-fire between Israel and Iran, claiming the US strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, but this assessment is disputed by intelligence agencies. The article argues that the cease-fire, without a diplomatic agreement, could lead Iran to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and pursue nuclear weapons covertly. The author draws a parallel to North Korea's actions and suggests that Iran may see withdrawing from the NPT as its most effective form of retaliation. The article suggests Trump missed an opportunity to leverage the strikes into a verifiable diplomatic deal to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The Independent Women's Forum (IWF) alleges that their tour bus was egged at an event in Santa Fe, New Mexico, celebrating the 53rd anniversary of Title IX, which featured an appearance by Linda McMahon.

This incident follows a similar event in July 2024 when an IWF bus was defaced in North Carolina. Despite the alleged vandalism and a last-minute venue change due to disagreement with the group's principles, the event proceeded with key speakers, including McMahon and activist Payton McNabb.</p>

          <p>A heat dome is causing oppressive heat across the eastern half of the contiguous U.S., affecting nearly 160 million people. The phenomenon occurs when high pressure traps warm air near the surface, suppressing clouds and precipitation. The National Weather Service has issued heat warnings and advisories, with temperatures soaring past 95 degrees in many areas and heat index values exceeding 100 degrees. Experts warn that the extreme heat poses a particular risk to children and people with existing health issues, and advise taking precautions to stay cool and hydrated.</p>

          <p>Teenage sprinter Gout Gout set a new Australian record in the men's 200m at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava, clocking 20.02 seconds on his senior international debut. The 17-year-old powered past Reynier Mena to secure victory in the highly anticipated race. Gout's time was better than Usain Bolt's first Golden Spike meet in 2006, although Bolt had a faster legal time under 20 seconds at a younger age. Gout will continue his preparation for the World Championships by competing at the Monaco Diamond League meet.</p>
