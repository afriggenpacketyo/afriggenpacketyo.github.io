        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium in recent months, with stocks of 60% enriched uranium exceeding 400 kilograms. The IAEA expressed serious concern over this development, noting that approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce an atomic bomb if further enriched to 90%. The IAEA also criticized Iran for its "less than satisfactory" cooperation, stating that Iran has not provided technically credible answers to the agency's questions and has sanitised locations, impeding verification activities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office responded by stating this is a clear warning sign that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program. The news comes amid ongoing talks between Iran and the US aimed at curtailing Tehran's nuclear program and preventing it from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Many Americans are anxious about their retirement savings, especially as they approach age 50, with over half of Gen Xers having saved no more than three times their current annual income, according to a Northwestern Mutual study. This is less than Fidelity's benchmark of accumulating six times your current annual income by age 50. Financial experts suggest working backward by estimating annual retirement income needs, adjusting for inflation, and determining annual savings and investment growth required to meet that goal. If feeling behind, experts advise against panic and recommend starting to save as soon as possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Army has issued guidelines for identifying and processing transgender service members for separation, following Defense Department guidance requiring voluntary departures by June 6. The directives instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth, and commanders are expected to initiate medical record reviews based on various criteria, including social media activity and private conversations. Army Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer, criticized the policy as worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," arguing it actively hunts down transgender service members. The Army spokesman stated that pronoun usage must reflect biological sex, and the Army recognizes the selfless service of all soldiers while ensuring alignment with recent policy changes.</p>

He noted a global shift in corporate finance, with many companies exploring bitcoin treasury strategies in various regions.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on Karla Flores' spine through her eye. The tumor was discovered after a misplaced MRI revealed a second chordoma at the top of her spine, wrapped around her spinal cord. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohammed Labib developed the "third nostril" approach, practicing the technique on cadavers to ensure safe removal of the tumor without damaging delicate nerves. The procedure involved cutting through the membrane protecting the eye and removing part of the eye socket, leaving Flores with no external scars.</p>

Despite these challenges, several court rulings have gone against Kohberger, including the admissibility of evidence related to his Amazon shopping history and a master's essay.

          <p>The "Dubai chocolate" trend, sparked by Fix Dessert Chocolatier in 2021, has taken the globe by storm, leading companies like Shake Shack and Crumbl to capitalize on its popularity with limited edition spinoffs. The original bars are filled with a mixture of pistachio cream, kadayif, and tahini, and went viral on social media in December 2023. While the Fix bars are only available in Dubai, numerous dupes have emerged, with Lindt developing a new permanent Dubai chocolate recipe. Nuts Factory, a New York City store, was among the first to create a dupe, and Trader Joe's recently launched a cheaper version.</p>

          <p>Several major retailers, including Costco, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, have announced they have already raised some prices or plan to hike them in the coming weeks to offset the impact of tariffs. President Donald Trump's trade policy has created uncertainty for retailers, who are trying to balance protecting their bottom lines with appeasing shoppers. Some retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance due to the tariff impact. Economists agree that tariffs are inflationary, and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, with a majority of U.S. CEOs saying they have either increased prices already or are considering doing so this year.</p>

This approach, while inconsistent, allowed for compellingly disorganized stories and emphasized the value of ignoring brand-building pressures. The more recent films, however, have shifted towards a stricter canon, attempting to connect previous events and characters in a more self-serious manner.</p>

Martha Gutierrez DeRomero initially claimed that two masked men stole her Chevy van containing $60,000 worth of fitness merchandise. However, after multiple interviews, authorities determined that DeRomero and her boyfriend, Alfredo Ledezma, had staged the incident to commit insurance fraud. Both have been charged with insurance fraud and filing a false police report, and are due back in court for arraignment hearings.</p>

However, people are generally spending more due to inflation, which might leave less money for non-essential items like travel, which is why of those who reduced their summer travel budgets, 34% of respondents plan to cut back on their in-destination spending activity, such as food or paid guided excursions.</p>
