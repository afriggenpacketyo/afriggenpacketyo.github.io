          <p>Tropical Depression Chantal brought significant rainfall to North Carolina, resulting in widespread flash flooding and prompting dozens of water rescues. The storm system, which made landfall as a tropical storm before weakening, caused rivers to crest near record levels and led to road collapses and voluntary evacuation notices. Although no injuries were immediately reported, the system is expected to continue moving northeast, with flood watches posted for several mid-Atlantic states. The National Hurricane Center has warned of continued heavy rainfall and the risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along the coast for the next few days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of international LGBTQ+ travelers are canceling or altering plans to visit the United States, citing concerns over anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and policies. Data from travel platforms shows a significant decline in U.S. bookings from Canadian and European users, who are instead choosing to spend their money in more inclusive destinations or their own countries. This trend reflects a broader drop in foreign tourism to the U.S., which some analysts attribute to negative perceptions tied to trade and immigration policies. Advocacy groups and travel industry leaders note that many LGBTQ+ individuals use their travel budgets as a form of activism to support welcoming economies.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House, with discussions expected to focus heavily on achieving a ceasefire in the Gaza war. While both leaders have celebrated recent joint military strikes against Iran, the ongoing conflict with Hamas presents a significant diplomatic hurdle. The U.S. is pushing for an agreement that would pause the fighting and secure the release of hostages, but a permanent end to the war remains contentious. The meeting also occurs within the broader context of Trump's vision for a remade Middle East, where an end to the Gaza conflict is seen as key to normalizing relations between Israel and other Arab nations like Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Recent flash floods in Texas have claimed dozens of lives, with many of the victims being children and staff at summer camps along the Guadalupe River. Among those lost were several young girls attending Camp Mystic, a nearly century-old Christian summer camp, and the camp's longtime director, Dick Eastland, who died while trying to save campers. The article provides personal details about many of the victims, including an 8-year-old described as 'living her best life' and a camp counselor remembered for her compassion.

Petty Officer Scott Ruskin is credited with saving an astonishing 165 victims in what was the first rescue mission of his career, earning him the title of 'American hero.' The report also touches upon other major news, including the political pressure on Israel's prime minister regarding the Gaza war and a new national security initiative involving ICE. However, the primary focus is on the positive story of bravery and rescue that emerged from the catastrophic flooding event in central Texas.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country has climbed to at least 82, with officials confirming that 41 or more people are still unaccounted for. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, has devastated communities and summer camps, with Kerr County being the hardest hit. Rescue operations are ongoing, with hundreds of personnel using air and water assets to search for survivors. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, as officials face scrutiny over the timeliness of their warnings and evacuation orders for what has been described as a '100-year-flood' event.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment will give people necessary time away from work to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners and advocates, including musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a significant step forward in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement and breaking the taboo surrounding the topic.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi-controlled ports in Yemen, including Hudaydah and Ras Issa, in response to ongoing missile and drone attacks aimed at Israel.

The Iran-backed Houthi group claimed its air defenses confronted the attack and retaliated by launching its own missiles and drones toward Israel.

Stephen Miran, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, indicated that while President Trump's deadline is approaching, nations showing progress might see their dates shifted, though he did not specify which ones. He contrasted this with countries not making concessions, which could face higher tariffs.

          <p>Economists are calling for more decisive action from Chinese authorities to combat the nation's persistent deflationary pressures and weak domestic demand. China's GDP deflator, a broad price measure, has been negative for over a year, and consumer prices have also been falling, signaling a concerning economic trend. Analysts argue that previous attempts to address the issue by reducing overcapacity have had limited success because the core problem is insufficient demand, driven by downturns in the property sector and declining household income expectations. They suggest that bolder steps are needed to break the deflationary spiral and stabilize the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab, which is responsible for the Pangu models, acknowledged using some open-source codes from other models but stated it strictly followed licensing requirements.

The allegations are based on intercepted phone calls and evidence from U.S. authorities. Chávez Jr. was recently arrested in California by ICE agents, citing cartel affiliations and an active arrest warrant in Mexico, and is now facing deportation.

Several noncitizen students and scholars were arrested and detained, and though now released, they still face deportation.

The article critiques past public health campaigns on diet and smoking as politically driven and scientifically weak. The pandemic is presented as the culmination of this trend, where inconsistent guidance and ideological decisions, like allowing certain protests while banning family gatherings, destroyed the field's credibility and made science a partisan issue.</p>

The author points to rising threats, vigilante attacks, and rhetoric from top leaders as signs of a worsening cycle.

          <p>The long-standing American model of suburban sprawl, which once fueled affordable housing growth in the Sunbelt, is now showing signs of breaking down. A new paper by urban economists finds that housing construction in booming metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted, leading to surging costs that mirror those in expensive coastal cities. The authors argue that the 'suburban frontier appears to be closing' as even these regions adopt restrictive zoning that prevents densification. The article suggests that to solve the national housing crisis, America must rethink the suburban model and allow for more flexible, dense, and incremental development.</p>

Contemplative practice can build the mental fortitude needed for effective altruism, while engagement with the world's suffering provides crucial insights for spiritual growth.

          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, 'Bring the House Down,' offers a satirical look at the world of arts criticism through the lens of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The story follows two newspaper critics: Alex, a harsh and influential anti-hero whose career-making or breaking reviews give him immense power, and Sophie, his junior colleague who narrates his public downfall. After Alex sleeps with a performer whose show he has just panned, she transforms her act into a public takedown of him, creating a national sensation. The review praises the novel as a delightfully snackable read that explores the power dynamics and personal obsessions within the profession, even if its central characters sometimes lack depth.</p>

          <p>Five families from Nayarit, Mexico, are suing former state attorney general Edgar Veytia, known as 'El Diablo,' in a U.S. federal court for alleged torture, death threats, and extortion. Veytia, who admitted to a reign of terror funded by cartel bribes, was convicted of drug trafficking in the U.S. but was released early after testifying against another high-level official. The lawsuit, filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act, seeks to hold Veytia accountable for the abuses he committed while in power, which plaintiffs say left them with no recourse in Mexico's corrupt justice system. Veytia's case highlights the deep-seated connection between Mexican officialdom and organized crime.</p>

          <p>Legislation in California that would require the largest fossil fuel companies to pay for climate-related damages has stalled again in the face of fierce opposition and lobbying from the oil and gas industry. The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act aimed to create a fund for climate mitigation and adaptation projects by assessing fees on companies responsible for major greenhouse gas emissions. Despite gaining momentum after recent wildfires, the bill failed to advance, with opponents spending over $10 million on lobbying in the first quarter of the year. Proponents argue the bill is a common-sense measure to make polluters clean up their own mess, but industry groups claim it would kill jobs and raise costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>A long-standing rivalry between UCLA and UC Berkeley has flared up on social media over which campus is the nation's number one public university. The dispute began after U.S. News & World Report's global rankings listed Berkeley as the top public institution, prompting celebratory posts. UCLA quickly countered by citing a separate U.S. News national ranking from nine months earlier that placed it at number one, a title it has held for several years. The back-and-forth has amused alumni and students of both schools, with chancellors joining the 'playful banter' and highlighting the different methodologies of the various popular college ranking systems.</p>

          <p>This column profiles Democratic Representative Robert Garcia of Long Beach, a formerly undocumented immigrant from Peru who has rapidly risen to a leadership position on the House Oversight Committee. Garcia is portrayed as a key figure in pushing back against the Trump administration's agenda, particularly its hardline immigration policies that have created fear in communities like his. The article highlights his journey from teaching himself English with Superman comics to becoming a mayor and now a congressman, framing him as the embodiment of the American dream. His aggressive but strategic style is seen as part of a generational shift within the Democratic Party, which is increasingly looking for fighters.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is systematically purifying the Republican party by ousting any members who show dissent. The recent retirement announcement of Senator Thom Tillis, after he opposed a bill and received a primary threat from Trump, is presented as the latest example of this pattern. The author contends that Trump's goal is not ideological consistency but absolute obedience, creating a smaller, more compliant party. This process, which has seen numerous critical Republicans either retire or be primaried, is seen as prioritizing personal loyalty over the party's electoral strength, effectively transforming it into a mob rather than a majority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has experienced its most significant slump in decades, raising questions about the long-term stability of America's financial dominance. This decline reverses a long period of gains and comes despite a relatively strong U.S. economy, confounding many investors. Some analysts attribute the trend to uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's policies on tariffs and the Federal Reserve, combined with a ballooning national debt. While some see the dollar's dip as a necessary market correction, others worry it signals a fundamental shift as foreign investors pull back from U.S. assets and look toward alternatives like the euro or yuan.
