          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Pollution in Waterways by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, addressing public outrage over pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water sector as "broken" and promised tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. The plan also includes a UK-wide ban on wet wipes containing plastic but stops short of nationalizing the industry, a move deemed too costly. This commitment comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, as pollution incidents and executive bonuses have risen.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first joint army training exercise this month in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Defence stated the drill's theme is "joint border patrol training" and aims to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries. This move toward closer defense ties occurs during the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The increased cooperation comes as both nations navigate economic pressures, including the ongoing US tariff war, strengthening their partnership.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden storm, resulting in at least 35 fatalities, including eight children. Most passengers were Vietnamese families from Hanoi, and several people remain missing. Survivors, including a 10-year-old boy found in an air pocket, described the storm's rapid and violent onset with hailstones and torrential rain. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has extended condolences and ordered a full investigation into the cause of the tragic accident. Rescue efforts were hampered by heavy rain but continued overnight.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order for the bear to be euthanized. The incident sparked a debate on human-wildlife conflict in Italy's Trentino region, where the bear population has grown significantly. The bear, which arrived safely, will now live in a secure, one-hectare enclosure, marking a resolution to the contentious case.</p>

The fossil revealed phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants, and small quartz crystals likely used as gastroliths to help grind tough food. This rare find confirms that this particular species was herbivorous, challenging previous assumptions about their diets. The discovery sheds new light on the ecological roles of pterosaurs, the creatures that dominated the skies during the age of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Six months into a hypothetical second term, President Trump's "force of personality" approach to foreign policy has failed to achieve its most ambitious goals, such as ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. While some successes like increased NATO spending have been noted, major promises remain unfulfilled, leading to a recent policy shift to resume missile sales to Ukraine. Critics argue that Trump's transactional and often erratic style, which favors autocrats and alienates allies, has underestimated the complexity of global geopolitics. The administration's reliance on tariffs and personal relationships has not translated into the swift victories promised.</p>

This heightened antagonism serves both political bases, allowing Trump to energize his supporters by confronting a liberal stronghold, while California leaders can rally their constituents by standing up to him.

Experts note the narrative contains key elements for longevity: a powerful, wealthy figure linked to celebrities and politicians, a heinous underlying crime, and perceived government secrecy. The situation has become particularly complex for Donald Trump, who previously encouraged such theories but now faces backlash from his base after the Justice Department found no secret client list and reaffirmed Epstein's death as a suicide.

          <p>A monument in Mexico City depicting the first meeting between revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Ernesto “Che” Guevara has been removed, igniting a fierce political and ideological debate. The sculpture, installed in 2017, was taken down under the order of a conservative borough president, who cited a lack of legal authorization and later called the figures harmful to human dignity. In response, Mexico's leftist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, criticized the removal, arguing it erases a significant historical moment that occurred in Mexico.

          <p>A teacher and freelance writer reflects on the "mom guilt" associated with not sending her children to summer camp, framing the choice as a financial necessity rather than a parenting philosophy. The article critiques recent media discussions about letting kids have "wild" or "'90s summers," arguing they often ignore the economic realities that dictate parents' decisions. It highlights that whether a mother works and needs childcare or forgoes camp because it's unaffordable, the underlying issue is a societal structure that fails to support families. The author concludes that the intense pressure and mental load disproportionately fall on mothers.</p>

The election has also seen the rise of a right-wing populist party campaigning on a stricter anti-foreigner platform.

          <h2>Study Reveals Nearly Half of Hospital Toilet Users Do Not Wash Their Hands</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Surrey found that 43.7% of people using a hospital toilet do not wash their hands afterward. Researchers partnered with a hospital in Denmark, using sensors on toilets and sinks to monitor hygiene behaviors over 19 weeks. The data revealed that handwashing rates were particularly low at the beginning and end of the day, as well as during mealtimes, with non-compliance peaking at over 60% in some weeks. Experts expressed concern that this behavior directly affects patient safety and called for more effective behavioral strategies to improve hand hygiene.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity contract killing, his sister has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, fled the UK and later escaped custody in India. Aamir's sister, Nishat, urged Ege to hand himself in, stating he is "not truly free" while living a life on the run. Aamir was stabbed to death at his Cardiff home by two hitmen who went to the wrong address; they were later convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>In a notable Wisconsin murder case, data from a Fitbit device played a crucial role in exonerating a man initially suspected of killing his girlfriend. After Nicole Vander Heyden was found murdered in 2016, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, became the prime suspect. However, his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was home and mostly asleep during the time of the murder. This technological alibi, along with other digital evidence from the actual killer's phone, shifted the investigation. Ultimately, another man, George Steven Burch, was identified through DNA and convicted of the crime, highlighting technology's growing role in justice.</p>
