          <p>In a Face the Nation interview, Senator Tammy Duckworth expressed serious concerns regarding Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's competence and handling of classified information, calling for his dismissal due to his putting national security at risk by using an unclassified signal chain. She also criticized Mike Waltz's nomination as Ambassador to the United Nations, citing his involvement in the same signal chain incident as disqualifying. Duckworth highlighted bipartisan support for increasing defense spending, particularly for the Navy, and criticized the administration's proposed cuts to programs like Women, Peace and Security. She also urged the Democratic Party to listen more to Midwest Democrats and address issues important to everyday voters, such as grocery prices and Social Security.</p>

          <p>The area housing Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company in South Texas has been officially approved as the new city of Starbase, with a vote overwhelmingly in favor. This move allows SpaceX to manage local affairs and potentially expand its operations. Critics express concerns over Musk's increased control and potential restrictions on public access to the beach. The city's formation coincides with SpaceX's request to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 per year.</p>

          <p>Nicaragua has withdrawn from UNESCO after the organization awarded its press freedom prize to the exiled Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa.

The move follows previous criticisms of UNESCO, including the US withdrawal under President Donald Trump, though the US has since rejoined.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of federal workers have been caught in a cycle of firings and court-ordered rehirings under the Trump administration, leading to significant instability and confusion. The administration, through Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency," has targeted probationary workers, leading to legal challenges and court-ordered reinstatements. The situation has disrupted government functions and raised concerns about the loss of expertise. The administration’s treatment of federal workers risked eroding longstanding expectations of job security and confidence in its public service mission.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested relatives of Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician who protested against the Communist regime’s new “mega-embassy” in London. The arrests occurred after Lau spoke at a rally against the embassy, leading to the detention and questioning of her aunt and uncle in Hong Kong. Lau believes the harassment is an attempt by officials to stop her “anti-Chinese” activities in the UK. The activist fled Hong Kong in 2021 after being placed under surveillance by Chinese authorities.</p>

          <p>China may make a ‘retaliatory’ move that could ‘hit us hard’ — especially US homeowners. Mortgage rates are climbing in response to a sell-off off in U.S. Treasury bonds, according to CNBC. If China wanted to hit us hard, they could unload Treasuries, Guy Cecala, executive chair of Inside Mortgage Finance, told CNBC. If Chinese institutions started selling off MBS — and if other countries start following suit — it could ripple through global financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging element in relationships. This phrase, while seemingly innocuous, conveys a message of inadequacy and can lead to insecurity issues over time. The underlying problem is often a fear of openly communicating needs, leading to passive-aggressive comparisons. Open and direct communication is essential for a healthy relationship, allowing partners to express their needs without shame or resorting to comparisons.</p>
