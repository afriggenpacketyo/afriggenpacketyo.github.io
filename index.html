          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has announced her retirement from international football after earning 88 caps for her country. The 32-year-old was a key member of the Lionesses' Euro 2022 winning squad and captained the team to the 2023 World Cup final. Citing a desire to focus on her club career with Chelsea and prioritize her mental and physical health after recent knee surgery, Bright described the decision as personal and said she is at peace with it. England manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bright as a "true leader" and an "England legend" for her significant contributions to the sport.</p>

          <p>A community in Humphreys County, Tennessee, is in mourning after an explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems munitions plant killed 16 people. On Sunday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil at the county courthouse to honor the victims and support their families. The cause of the Friday explosion, which completely destroyed a building and scattered debris for miles, is still under investigation by authorities. The operation has now shifted from rescue to recovery, with teams working to identify the remains of the deceased workers in what the local sheriff called a devastating scene.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, King Abdullah II of Jordan issued a stark warning that the Middle East faces a grim future without a peace process that establishes an independent Palestinian state. Speaking ahead of a summit in Egypt regarding a U.S.-mediated peace plan, the king emphasized that a two-state solution is the only viable path to lasting stability for both Israelis and Palestinians. He expressed deep distrust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but remained hopeful that progress could be made with other Israeli leaders. The king stressed the urgency of the situation, stating peace is the only option to prevent wider regional conflict.</p>

          <p>As part of a landmark ceasefire deal mediated by the U.S., twenty living hostages were released from Gaza and returned to Israel, where they were reunited with their families after two years in captivity. The agreement also involves Israel freeing approximately 1,900 Palestinians from its jails, leading to celebrations in the West Bank and Gaza. The deal was marked by a visit from U.S. President Donald Trump, who addressed the Israeli Knesset and hailed the beginning of a new peace accord. Uncertainty remains over the return of deceased hostages, but the truce provides a moment of relief in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <h2>US Treasury Provides $20 Billion Currency Swap Line to Stabilize Argentina's Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 11:54:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has extended a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina's central bank in an effort to prevent a potential financial crisis. Announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the move aims to provide liquidity and stability for the volatile Argentine peso ahead of the country's key midterm elections. While officials praised the intervention as a crucial "circuit breaker" for Argentina's economic strain, some critics have questioned the decision, citing the country's history of debt defaults. The action is seen as having both economic and political motivations, supporting the government of President Javier Milei, a U.S. ally.</p>

These tariffs were enacted in retaliation for the imprisonment of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro.

These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago, and the variable-rate nature of HELOCs means borrowers can automatically benefit from future rate cuts.

          <h2>Study Links Increased Social Media Use in Preteens to Lower Cognitive Test Scores</h2>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA suggests a link between increased social media use and poorer cognitive performance in early adolescence. Researchers analyzing data from over 6,000 children found that those who spent more time on social media between the ages of 9 and 13 performed worse on tests for reading, vocabulary, and memory. Even those with moderate use of about one hour per day scored lower than their peers with little to no social media exposure. Experts note that this period is critical for brain development, and hypersensitivity to social media's constant feedback may hinder the development of other cognitive functions.</p>

          <p>Shares of Bloom Energy soared by more than 20% after the company announced a major deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install its fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers. Brookfield plans to invest up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom's on-site power technology, which can run on natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen and does not rely on the traditional electric grid. The partnership aims to build "AI factories" globally to meet the massive and rapidly growing energy demands of the AI industry. This move addresses concerns that large-scale AI operations could strain aging power grids.</p>

          <h2>Analysts View Latest US-China Trade Flare-Up as a Manageable, Short-Term Issue</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent escalation in trade tensions, including new Chinese export controls on rare earths and a retaliatory tariff threat from the U.S., analysts suggest the situation is likely a short-term scare. Both Washington and Beijing appear to be seeking an off-ramp to de-escalate the conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump softened his tone over the weekend, stating he believed relations would "be fine with China." Experts believe the two powers are currently focused on managing immediate disputes rather than addressing the deeper, structural challenges in their economic relationship, indicating a desire to avoid a full-blown trade war.</p>

          <p>A landmark ceasefire agreement has culminated in Hamas freeing the last living Israeli hostages from Gaza, while Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The exchange brought emotional reunions on both sides and was hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump in a speech to the Israeli Knesset as the arrival of peace in the Holy Land. Trump is now co-chairing a summit in Egypt to discuss the region's future and solidify the truce. Despite the celebrations, significant challenges remain, including the recovery of deceased hostages and the long-term governance of Gaza.</p>
