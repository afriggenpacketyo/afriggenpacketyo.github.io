          <p>Morgan Stanley has removed previous restrictions on cryptocurrency investments for its wealth management clients, now allowing all customers to access crypto funds regardless of their risk tolerance or asset level. This policy change, effective October 15, also permits these investments in retirement accounts. The firm will use an automated system to monitor client concentration in this volatile asset class, aligning with its global investment committee's recommendation of a maximum initial allocation of up to 4%. This move reflects a broader shift in the financial industry's approach to digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old man, Fayaz Khan, has been found guilty of threatening to kill Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The conviction stems from a video Khan posted on TikTok in October of the previous year, in which he named Farage and made a threatening gun gesture with his hand. The verdict was delivered by a jury at Southwark Crown Court following deliberations. The case highlights the legal consequences of online threats directed at public figures.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, federal workers, both furloughed and those working without pay, are voicing significant concerns about their financial stability. Employees from agencies like the National Labor Relations Board describe the anxiety of having no income and the potential need to accumulate debt to cover basic living expenses. The shutdown not only creates personal financial hardship but also halts essential government services, preventing agencies from carrying out their duties. Workers express that the situation takes a psychological toll and undermines morale, despite their commitment to public service.</p>

          <p>Gregg Wallace, the former presenter of 'MasterChef,' is taking legal action against the BBC and BBC Studios, seeking up to £10,000 in damages. Court documents reveal Wallace claims the broadcaster caused him "distress and harassment" by failing to provide copies of his personal data related to his 21-year tenure, following his dismissal in July. His sacking came after a report upheld over 40 allegations regarding his conduct on the show. Wallace's lawyer alleges the BBC and its subsidiary unlawfully withheld and redacted information, breaching their statutory duty.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies are based on a flawed economic premise and will ultimately damage American prosperity. The author refutes the idea that deporting immigrants creates jobs for native-born workers, citing historical examples like the end of the Bracero program, which did not raise wages or employment for domestic workers. Instead, mass deportations are shown to reduce the overall labor force, harming industries from agriculture to healthcare and negatively impacting American businesses and their employees.

Proponents suggest it could revolutionize medicine by creating longer-lasting therapeutics, while opponents warn of catastrophic risks, such as mirror bacteria evading immune systems and causing ecosystem collapse. A paper in 'Science' last year called for a halt to creating mirror organisms, but many researchers argue that work on mirror biomolecules, which do not replicate, should continue.

          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the biggest mistake young investors make is being overly cautious and prioritizing downside protection over potential upside. He argues that since young people have a long time horizon, they should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. Historically, stocks have outperformed other asset classes over the long term, making them essential for building wealth and outpacing inflation. Brown recommends that new investors start with low-cost, broad-market index funds to achieve diversified exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted one of its largest concentrated attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, using hundreds of drones and missiles to target civilian and power infrastructure across the country. The overnight assault caused widespread blackouts in nine regions and resulted in at least 20 injuries in Kyiv, where a residential building was hit. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a calculated effort to cripple the country ahead of winter and called for decisive action from allies to provide more air defense systems. Repair work is underway to restore power and water supplies.</p>

          <p>U.S. soybean farmers are caught in the middle of a trade war with China, which has historically been the largest buyer of American soybean exports but has purchased none this year. This has left farmers with full grain bins and uncertain prospects for selling their harvest, creating a financial crisis reminiscent of the 1980s. While the Trump administration has indicated a relief plan is forthcoming, its delay due to the government shutdown has increased anxiety in farming communities. Farmers are now facing a volatile market and the difficult decision of when to sell their crops.</p>

The company's success is driven by offering popular brands such as Columbia and Gap alongside its private Kirkland Signature label.

This move is the latest in a series of tit-for-tat actions between the two nations, escalating trade tensions.

U.S. regulators argue that access to Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage with shorter and cheaper flights. Beijing responded by stating the ban would harm people-to-people exchanges and urged Washington to consider the negative impact on American companies and global consumers. Russia has barred U.S. airlines from its airspace in retaliation for similar bans imposed after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day in history after the luxury automaker released new full-year guidance and long-term strategic plans that fell short of analyst expectations. The company also scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions, now targeting a 20% share for fully electric models by 2030, down from a previous goal of 40%. The disappointing financial forecast led to a more than 15% drop in its stock price on both the Milan and New York exchanges.

However, authorities later charged her with murder, speculating she used a blunt object, though no weapon was ever found.
