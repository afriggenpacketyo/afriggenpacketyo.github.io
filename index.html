Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has announced plans to overhaul the air traffic control system over the next three to four years.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the country's law requiring couples to share a surname. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% expressing willingness to marry if separate surnames were permitted. This law, unique globally, faces opposition from conservative politicians concerned about traditional family values. Common-law couples in Japan lack legal marriage benefits like tax deductions and inheritance rights, impacting an estimated 1.22 million people.</p>

          <p>Katy Perry is facing criticism for her participation in a Blue Origin spaceflight and subsequent tour performances, with many finding her actions and persona out of touch. Critics argue that Perry's pop star image, once popular in the 2010s, hasn't evolved and that her messages of love and spirituality seem insincere, especially given her collaboration with producer Dr. Luke, who faced sexual assault allegations. The article also notes the shift in female pop stardom towards relatability and authenticity, contrasting with Perry's attempts to distance herself from her pop persona.</p>

Some residents blame the Ukrainian army, while others quietly criticize Putin for initiating the conflict, with many feeling abandoned by the Russian government despite state media's portrayal of unity and support.</p>
