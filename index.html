The company employs a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews.

This adjustment considers the potential for a prolonged rivalry with the United States and the necessity to address structural problems within China. The planner, Xu Lin, emphasized that a 4% GDP growth would be favorable if it leads to expanded employment and controlled debt ratios. This proposal contrasts with market estimates of around 4.5% annual growth from 2026-30.</p>
