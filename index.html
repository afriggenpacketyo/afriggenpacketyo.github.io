          <p>Senator Joni Ernst faced criticism after responding to concerns about Medicaid cuts by stating, "Well, we all are going to die." This comment, made during a town hall meeting in Iowa, was deemed insensitive by many, particularly given the context of potential healthcare limitations. Ernst later issued an apology video filmed in a cemetery, but the incident highlights the ongoing debate over healthcare accessibility and the importance of considering the impact of policy decisions on vulnerable populations. The article emphasizes the shift towards a political climate where apologies are less common, and doubling down on controversial statements is more prevalent. The incident underscores the increasing polarization of political discourse. </p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 4% drop following Elon Musk's continued public opposition to President Donald Trump's spending bill. Musk, who previously served as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has strongly criticized the bill, even threatening to challenge lawmakers who support it. This decline comes after a strong rally in May, despite weak sales figures for Tesla. Musk's outspoken stance against the administration marks a notable shift in his relationship with Trump, as he now openly opposes the president's signature tax-cut bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new travel ban affecting individuals from 12 countries, including seven African nations: Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan. The ban, justified by national security concerns, also impacts Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti, Iran, and Yemen. Additionally, travel restrictions will be placed on nationals from Burundi, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba, Laos, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The White House cites security risks and inadequate vetting processes in the affected countries as the basis for the order, which is set to take effect on June 9 and is already facing criticism and potential legal challenges. The ban is likely to raise concerns about its impact on international relations and humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>NBA teams have experienced an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, largely driven by the introduction of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The number of jersey patch deals has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing over $80 million in new spending. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are identified as the top-spending brands in the league.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with Marlean Ames, an Ohio woman alleging employment discrimination by her gay employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services. Ames claims she was denied a promotion and later demoted in favor of less qualified gay candidates. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, delivering the opinion, stated that Ames was unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The court vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded the case, meaning Ames' lawsuit can proceed under the proper prima facie standard, though her success is not guaranteed. The ruling clarifies the legal standard for discrimination claims brought by members of a majority group.</p>

The court upheld the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which generally shields gun companies from liability for crimes committed with their products. Mexico had argued that the companies deliberately maintained a distribution system that included dealers who knowingly sold weapons to straw purchasers, who then trafficked the guns to cartels.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a new travel ban impacting individuals from 12 countries, marking a revisit to a key policy from his first term. Legal experts note that this ban appears to be more legally sound than the original 2017 travel ban, which faced numerous legal challenges. The new restrictions are wider in scope and have clearly defined exemptions, addressing some of the issues that led to the previous ban being challenged as discriminatory. While Muslim-majority states are not the express target, the ban is still likely to face scrutiny and potential legal challenges. </p>

          <p>The article analyzes how tariffs could affect the price of goods like shoes and sweaters, using pricing models created by AlixPartners. Under a current 30% tariff, the price of a men's cotton sweater and a pair of men's shoes made in China would both rise about 19%. If Trump implemented the currently suspended 145% tariff on imports from China, the price of those same sweaters or shoes would spike roughly 90%. Retailers are employing various strategies to offset the cost of tariffs, but consumers could still face significant price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to recalled cucumbers has sickened nearly four dozen people across 18 states, leading to at least 16 hospitalizations. The recalled cucumbers, grown by Bedner Growers Inc., were distributed by Fresh Start Produce Inc. and sold at various locations, including grocery stores and restaurants. The CDC advises consumers to throw away cucumbers if they cannot determine their origin and to wash surfaces that may have come into contact with the produce.

          <p>The article provides guidance on how to safely dispose of expired medications and sunscreen, emphasizing the importance of not using them after their expiration dates. Expired medications can become less potent or contaminated, posing health risks. Sunscreen should also be discarded after its expiration date due to decreased effectiveness. The best way to dispose of expired medications is through medication take-back locations, but household garbage disposal is an option if mixed with coffee grounds or kitty litter. Proper storage in a cool, dry place is crucial for maintaining medication efficacy. </p>

          <p>A prominent TV weatherman in Florida, John Morales, has publicly warned that Trump administration funding cuts to federal weather forecasting agencies will degrade the accuracy of hurricane forecasts. Morales stated that staff shortages at the National Weather Service and NOAA will hamper his ability to inform viewers about incoming hurricanes. He expressed concern that reduced weather balloon releases and potential limitations on hurricane hunter aircraft will leave forecasters "flying blind." Morales urged viewers to contact their representatives to stop the funding cuts and protect the National Weather Service. </p>

An autopen is a machine that replicates a person's signature using a pen or other writing instrument, distinct from a scanned digital image. The technology has been used by presidents for routine correspondence and even legislation, although some have been guarded about its use.

          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for their role in the country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico's government had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border is a result of "deliberate" practices by US firms that they say appealed to cartel members with their products.
