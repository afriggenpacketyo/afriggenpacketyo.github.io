            <p>Malaysia is preparing to repatriate giant pandas Fu Wa and Feng Yi to China, marking the end of their stay and the beginning of a new 10-year conservation agreement between the two countries. The new agreement, signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit, will allow Malaysia to host another pair of pandas from 2025 to 2035, continuing a long-standing collaboration. Fu Wa and Feng Yi are currently in quarantine at the Giant Panda Conservation Centre in Kuala Lumpur's National Zoo to ensure their health and acclimatization before their return flight. Visitors may still catch glimpses of the pandas at designated times during the quarantine period.</p>

            <p>Astronaut Don Pettit, the oldest serving US astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday by returning to Earth after spending 220 days on the International Space Station (ISS) with Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner. The Soyuz MS-26 spacecraft made a successful parachute-assisted landing in Kazakhstan, concluding Pettit's fourth mission and bringing his total time in space to 590 days. While Pettit is not the oldest person to fly in orbit, a record held by John Glenn, his return marks the end of a significant mission and the beginning of his physical rehabilitation back on Earth. The crew orbited the Earth 3,520 times during their time on the ISS, contributing to ongoing space research and exploration.</p>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that his government will not include discussions on security matters in its trade talks with the United States, despite calls from President Donald Trump to reduce the U.S.'s burden in defending Japan. Ishiba emphasized that security and trade issues should be addressed separately, prioritizing the reduction of the U.S. trade deficit as Trump's main objective. He pledged to review Japan's automobile regulations to facilitate negotiations with the U.S., ensuring fairness and avoiding accusations of unfair trade practices. Ishiba also expressed Japan's commitment to free trade and cooperation with ASEAN and the European Union, while voicing concerns about the negative impact of the U.S.-China tariff escalation.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is facing an increasing number of espionage cases, revealing vulnerabilities in the island's political and military defenses. Several individuals closely associated with senior DPP politicians are under investigation or have been detained for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence. These breaches have raised concerns about Beijing's intensified efforts to undermine Taiwan's authorities from within, particularly since William Lai Ching-te took office as the island’s leader. Experts suggest that China has developed an effective system to lure Taiwanese individuals into espionage, posing a significant challenge to the DPP government's counter-intelligence efforts.</p>

            <p>NASA astronaut Don Pettit, along with two Russian cosmonauts, concluded a 220-day mission on the International Space Station, returning to Earth in a Soyuz spacecraft. The landing took place in Kazakhstan, with Pettit experiencing some disorientation upon return to gravity. The mission involved 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles traveled since launching in September. The ISS faces challenges, including air leaks and budget shortfalls, but continues to be staffed by rotating crews. Spacecraft are being developed to ensure a safe deorbit of the station in 2030.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, achieving devastating chemical chain reactions without using nuclear materials. The 2kg bomb created a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, significantly longer than TNT blasts. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, utilizes a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. This material releases hydrogen gas upon activation, which then ignites into a sustained inferno, potentially leading to new applications in both civilian and military fields.</p>
