          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release from a federal prison in New Jersey. Santos was serving an 87-month sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, charges that led to his expulsion from Congress in 2023 after a House Ethics Committee report found substantial evidence of law violations. Trump justified the commutation by claiming Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison, enduring long stretches of solitary confinement. He also controversially drew a comparison to a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of lying about military service, implying Santos's consistent Republican voting record somehow merited clemency despite his proven crimes.</p>

          <p>A man who gained the nickname 'Postal Malone' due to his resemblance to the singer Post Malone has been arrested in Orange County, California, suspected of a string of package thefts. Jacob Daniel Rodriguez, 45, of Santa Ana, was booked into Orange County Jail on burglary charges. Authorities had actively sought public assistance, sharing photos of the suspect captured on camera stealing multiple packages from an Irvine apartment community. Police humorously referenced Post Malone's hits in their social media announcement, noting the suspect's distinctive facial and hand tattoos, which contributed to his memorable moniker.</p>

          <p>Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, was executed by lethal injection in Arizona for the 1993 murders of four members of the Luna family in Phoenix. Djerf, who had spent over 29 years in prison, chose not to seek clemency and had previously acknowledged the killings, offering an apology. Prosecutors stated Djerf's motive was revenge over stolen goods, leading to the brutal sexual assault and murder of Rochelle Luna, and the killings of Albert Luna Sr., Patricia Luna, and 5-year-old Damien Luna. The execution marks Arizona's second this year, occurring amidst past controversies regarding the state's lethal injection procedures.</p>

          <p>Alexander Acosta, the former US attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal, testified before the House oversight committee that taking the sexual assault case to trial would have been a "crapshoot." A recently released transcript reveals Acosta's concerns about significant evidentiary hurdles, including a lack of cooperation from victims and inconsistencies in their accounts, which he believed defense counsel would have exploited. He argued that securing a guilty plea and sex offender registration was paramount to send a strong signal that such behavior was unacceptable, preventing Epstein from "getting away with it" entirely. Acosta also denied consulting Donald Trump about the deal and expressed frustration with the defense team's aggressive, though not unethical, tactics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's lawyers have filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, seeking to uphold the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The administration argues that federal troops are necessary to protect U.S. immigration agents from hostile protesters and to enforce federal laws, citing a "rebellion or danger of rebellion" as justification. This move escalates a clash with Democratic state officials and challenges lower court rulings that found no such danger, accusing Trump's lawyers of exaggerating claims of violence. The appeal references a successful National Guard deployment in Los Angeles as precedent, while Illinois officials attribute protests to aggressive ICE enforcement actions, highlighting the contentious nature of federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have reduced the charge against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, from a felony to a misdemeanor. Huerta was arrested during immigration raids in Los Angeles, accused of obstructing federal authorities from serving a search warrant and arresting undocumented immigrants. His attorneys and union assert that Huerta was exercising his First Amendment rights and is being targeted for his outspoken criticism of immigration policies. The new charge carries a maximum of one year in federal prison, significantly less than the six years for the original felony, as Huerta continues to deny wrongdoing and plans to seek a speedy trial to clear his name.</p>

          <p>A new blood test, the Galleri test, is showing exciting results in detecting over 50 types of cancer, often at early stages where treatment is more effective. A North American trial involving 25,000 adults found the test identified cancer in 62% of positive results, accurately ruling out cancer in over 99% of negative cases. Significantly, three-quarters of detected cancers were types without existing screening programs, such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer, highlighting its potential to fill critical diagnostic gaps. While scientists await further evidence from a large NHS trial next year, these findings suggest the test could revolutionize early cancer diagnosis and significantly improve patient outcomes globally.</p>

This decision, made in discussion with King Charles III, aims to prevent further distraction from the Royal Family's work. A "tipping point" was reached after an email surfaced showing Andrew maintained contact with Epstein longer than he publicly claimed, coupled with the imminent posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual assault. The move allows the changes to be managed internally, avoiding parliamentary intervention, yet the US House Oversight Committee continues its probe into Epstein-related documents.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing an architectural legacy, privately financing a $250 million White House ballroom and proposing an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. The ballroom project, now expanded and fully funded, was celebrated at a donor dinner attended by tech and business leaders. Democrats, however, are bristling at the initiatives, with California Rep. Mark Takano introducing bills to ban donor names on White House structures and prohibit federal construction during shutdowns. A House Oversight Committee probe into the ballroom's financing, including potential foreign donations and contracts, underscores the political controversy surrounding these legacy projects.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed interest in a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait connecting Russia and Alaska. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev suggested the $8 billion project, which would symbolize unity and could be completed in eight years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, voiced unhappiness with the idea. The proposal follows recent talks between Putin and Trump about the Ukraine War. Concerns exist regarding the Boring Company's track record in challenging environments and Musk's previous ties to Russia and Putin, adding layers of geopolitical and logistical complexity.</p>

          <p>CBS News is ending its over 60-year physical presence at the Pentagon after declining to sign new press requirements that reporters' associations argue infringe on First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's new policy mandates formal authorization to publish even unclassified information, a condition most major news organizations rejected, though One America News Network agreed. CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin and producer Mary Walsh, who built careers reporting from the Pentagon halls, emphasized the importance of direct access for building trust and breaking stories. Despite losing the workspace, CBS News affirms its commitment to covering military affairs.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims Venezuelan Leader Maduro Offered Concessions Amid US Pressure</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro offered "everything," including oil and natural resources, to ease US tensions, using an expletive to underscore his point. Trump confirmed the US has conducted at least six strikes on suspected drug vessels off Venezuela, resulting in fatalities and recently, survivors. Legal scholars have raised concerns that these military actions and authorized covert operations, possibly for regime change, stretch international law and human rights standards. Venezuela's government has denounced the strikes as illegal and an aggression, appealing to the UN Security Council amidst a significant US military buildup in the Caribbean.</p>
