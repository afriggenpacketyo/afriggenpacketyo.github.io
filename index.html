          <p>Professor Michele Dougherty has been named the UK's new Astronomer Royal, becoming the first woman to hold the prestigious advisory role in its 350-year history. Despite not studying science in secondary school, her passion led her to become a leading space scientist involved in a mission to Jupiter's icy moons. Dougherty hopes her appointment will inspire more women and girls to pursue science and aims to use the position to engage the public about the wonders of space and its economic importance. Her achievement is celebrated as a significant step toward greater diversity in science.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly mass shooting in midtown Manhattan, New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is facing renewed scrutiny for a past pledge to disband the NYPD's Strategic Response Group (SRG). This specialized unit is tasked with responding to major incidents like mass shootings and civil unrest. While Mamdani has expressed his sorrow for the victims and gratitude for first responders, his previous statements have resurfaced, creating a contentious political discussion around policing strategies. The article highlights the tension between police reform advocacy and public safety concerns following a high-profile tragedy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to be cautious regarding the initial public offering of design software company Figma, suggesting its valuation may be too high from the start. While praising Figma's strong business fundamentals, impressive client list including Netflix and Google, and profitability, he voiced concerns over its high IPO price. Cramer also noted recent weakness in the enterprise software sector and potential margin pressures from the company's necessary, long-term investments in artificial intelligence. He suggests the stock could become too expensive if it surges immediately after trading begins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking ring, has stated she will only testify before a House committee if she receives immunity or a presidential pardon. Her lawyer communicated to the House Oversight Committee that without such protections, she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination, as her legal appeals are still pending. The committee has subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition in August but stated it will not consider granting immunity, creating a standoff over her potential testimony.</p>

          <p>As the latest five-day strike by doctors in England concludes, the long-running dispute with the government is far from resolved, with twelve walkouts having already occurred. Although the Labour government initially made a deal, doctors feel promises for further pay restoration have not been met, leading to renewed industrial action. Tensions have escalated between the British Medical Association (BMA) and officials, though both sides now show tentative signs of willingness to resume negotiations. The core disagreement remains over pay, but discussions have also covered non-pay issues like working conditions and exam fees.</p>

          <p>Following a mass shooting in Manhattan where the gunman cited chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a note, this article explores the complexities of the condition. While the shooter, a former high school football player, requested his brain be studied, experts caution against definitively blaming CTE for his actions. The article notes that CTE is difficult to diagnose, especially in those with limited football careers, and its symptoms can overlap with other disorders. Experts argue that over-attributing violent behavior to CTE is a harmful oversimplification, potentially ignoring other mental health factors and creating a sense of inevitability.</p>

The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that may trigger migraines in susceptible people. Additionally, its natural sugar content, though moderate, means that individuals with diabetes should be mindful of their intake.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that his government will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes immediate, substantive steps to de-escalate the crisis in Gaza. The conditions include agreeing to a ceasefire, committing to a two-state solution, and allowing the UN to restart aid distribution. This marks a significant shift in UK policy, aligning more closely with other European nations like France that have made similar announcements. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the move, calling it a reward for terrorism, while the US expressed reservations about the timing.</p>

          <p>A new executive order on homelessness signed by President Trump is causing concern among advocates, who worry it may lead to harmful policies. The order aims to shift the national approach by making it easier for cities and states to move unhoused individuals into treatment for mental illness or addiction, including potentially forcing them into care. The administration argues that previous strategies have failed to address the root causes of homelessness despite significant federal spending. However, critics fear this new directive could infringe on individual rights without providing the necessary resources for effective, long-term solutions.</p>

Authorities recommend hiking in groups, making noise, carrying bear spray, and keeping pets leashed.
