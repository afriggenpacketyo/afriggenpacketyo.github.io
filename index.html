          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to ongoing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests, supplementing the existing National Guard and Marine Corps personnel. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as reckless and politically motivated, arguing that the initial troops remain unused. The federal government claims the deployment is necessary to protect federal personnel and property due to violent clashes, while local officials denounce it as unnecessary and inflammatory. The state of California has sued the Trump administration, alleging an illegal power grab that undermines Newsom's authority over the National Guard. The governor has framed this as an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism. Optimism remains low amidst escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's remark that it would be "great" to arrest California Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified their conflict over the handling of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles. Newsom responded by accusing Trump of authoritarianism, while Trump criticized Newsom's governance. Trump has deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles, which Newsom opposes, leading to a lawsuit by California against the Trump administration. The situation has become a focal point for Trump to emphasize immigration enforcement, while Newsom accuses the White House of exploiting the situation for political gain. This confrontation puts Newsom back in the national spotlight, potentially impacting his future political aspirations.</p>

          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot are accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy in its response to unrest in Los Angeles, contrasting the aggressive stance against those accused of assaulting police in Los Angeles with the defense of individuals involved in the Capitol siege. The disparity is inflaming controversy, with some officials' statements criticized for overlooking the severity of the January 6th events. Democrats in Congress have also noted the contrast in Trump's swift deployment of the National Guard to California compared to the delayed response during the Capitol attack.

          <p>A report by the Women and Equalities Committee in the UK has labeled the statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" with "fundamental flaws." The report argues that paternity leave rules reinforce outdated gender stereotypes and require significant investment to improve. It suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. The current system provides £187.18 a week or 90% of average earnings, whichever is lower, which is considered inadequate. The report coincides with calls for an overhaul of parental leave policies.</p>

While the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges the potential for AI to enhance teaching, concerns remain regarding data breaches and errors. Experts suggest teachers have a responsibility to learn how to use AI effectively, while cautioning against fully outsourcing tasks to AI.</p>

          <p>A North Korean Choi-Hyun class frigate, which partially sunk during a launch ceremony attended by Kim Jong Un, is now in a dry dock for repairs. Satellite images reveal structural damage to the ship's superstructure, with mangled metal and bent lines visible. Seawater flooding has likely impacted machinery and electronics, complicating the repair process. The vessel is located near the Russian border, raising speculation about potential assistance from China or Russia in the repair efforts. The incident was an embarrassment for the image-conscious regime, which is attempting to restore the ship's condition.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles against the wishes of local authorities demonstrates autocratic tendencies. The author contends that Trump is inventing a crisis to justify an authoritarian crackdown, targeting peaceful protesters along with those engaged in violence. The article criticizes the administration's broad definition of illegitimate uprising and warns against normalizing the use of military force to suppress dissent. The author expresses concern over the erosion of democratic norms and the potential for further escalations.</p>

          <p>A former chair of the Environment Agency in the UK has warned that successive governments have failed to address the threat of toxic chemicals in sewage sludge spread on farmers' fields. The sludge, used as cheap fertilizer, may contain cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and industrial pollutants. Efforts to update regulations to include new contaminants have been frustrated. The water industry is reportedly concerned about potential restrictions on sludge spreading and is lobbying regulators and making contingency plans. The situation raises concerns about long-term soil contamination and potential harm to human health.</p>
