          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, challenging their laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit targets policies that prohibit officers from detaining individuals solely on civil immigration detainers and restrict information sharing with federal authorities. Denver's measure banning the use of city resources for immigration enforcement is also challenged. The lawsuit seeks to declare these laws unconstitutional, with officials in Colorado stating they will follow the court's ruling. This action is part of a broader effort by the administration to compel local law enforcement to assist with deportation efforts.</p>

While the expert stated that some initial force was justified, he acknowledged that the blows to Nichols' head constituted deadly force and should have been stopped.
