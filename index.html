          <p>Hurricane Erin has become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a Category 4 storm. Located northeast of Puerto Rico, the storm is expected to bring heavy rain and potential flooding to the island and the U.S. Virgin Islands over the weekend. While meteorological models currently predict Erin will stay well off the U.S. East Coast, its effects will still be felt through large waves and life-threatening rip currents expected to impact the coastline from August 20 to 27, posing a risk to coastal property and safety.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian sniper unit has reportedly set a new world record for the longest confirmed sniper kill, eliminating two Russian soldiers from a distance of over 13,000 feet (4,000 meters). The shot, which occurred near Pokrovsk, was allegedly made with a Ukrainian-produced rifle guided by a drone and artificial intelligence. This event surpasses the previous record, also held by a Ukrainian sniper, and takes place amidst intensified Russian attacks in the region. The report comes just ahead of high-level diplomatic meetings between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, Pembrokeshire, has been transformed into a luxurious private venue and is now on the market for £3 million. The former CEO, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable, overcoming logistical hurdles like having no running water or electricity. Now equipped with 40 beds, a nightclub, and modern amenities, the historic fortress that once protected Milford Haven is being marketed as a unique party island or potential tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>As food prices rise, parents in the UK are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking methods to manage the cost of feeding children during the six-week school summer holidays. Strategies shared by families include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items for the freezer, batch cooking, and organizing the fridge to use food before it expires to minimize waste. Some parents also rely on local food pantries, which provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost, highlighting the financial pressures many households face when subsidized school meals are unavailable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced a halt to all visitor visas for people from Gaza, citing the need for a comprehensive review of the procedures for issuing temporary medical-humanitarian visas. This decision follows a social media campaign by a far-right activist who criticized the program. Palestinian rights groups, such as the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, have condemned the move, stating it will have a devastating impact on their ability to bring critically ill and injured children from Gaza to the U.S. for lifesaving medical care amid the region's damaged healthcare infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Authorities in San Bernardino County are investigating the disappearance of a 7-month-old infant, Emmanuel Haro, and have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. The baby's mother, Rebecca Haro, reported that she was assaulted and knocked unconscious in a store parking lot, and her son was gone when she awoke. However, investigators noted inconsistencies in her statement, and she declined to continue her interview after being confronted with them. The parents have publicly pleaded for their son's safe return as the search continues.</p>

          <p>The accessories chain Claire's, once a popular destination for tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after struggling with declining sales and intense competition. For decades, the brand was a staple for affordable jewelry, ear piercings, and novelty items, but its relevance has diminished with the rise of online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu. Analysts suggest that Claire's has been slow to adapt to social media trends and cannot compete on price, while younger consumers are now drawn to both ultra-cheap online retailers and more premium brands.</p>

          <p>Despite an ongoing heatwave, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, such as leaves changing color and fruit ripening ahead of schedule. Experts explain that this phenomenon, sometimes called a "false autumn," is a stress response from nature due to the prolonged hot and dry conditions, which may make this summer one of the warmest on record. While some gardeners have benefited from the weather, conservationists warn that the disruption to natural cycles could negatively impact wildlife, affecting food sources for animals like birds and badgers heading into winter.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed offensive aimed at taking control of northern Gaza City. The military's civilian affairs agency stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment for the displaced population would resume through the Kerem Shalom crossing. This announcement comes as Israeli forces have intensified operations on the outskirts of Gaza City, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as the final stronghold of Hamas. The timing for the relocation has not been specified.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment has died. She arrived in Pisa in a severely emaciated state and suffered a cardiac arrest less than 48 hours later, according to the hospital. Her death highlights the severe malnutrition crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of famine conditions. Italy is one of several countries that has established a scheme to evacuate critically ill patients from the conflict zone, with over 180 adults and children having been brought to the country for care.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged in the second quarter, rising from 23% to 31%, while Apple's share declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and new designs are creating renewed competition, with analysts expecting Apple to release its own foldable phone by 2026.

          <p>An opinion article argues that key environmental laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 are under threat from the Trump administration and need to be strengthened, not weakened. While the act has been successful in helping some species like elephant seals recover, many marine mammals face new dangers from climate change, pollution, and ship strikes. The author points to the declining North Atlantic right whale and gray whale populations as evidence that protections are still urgently needed, stating that the health of these animals serves as a critical indicator for the health of the oceans and the planet.</p>

The mother, Sarah Shaw, who has been living legally in the U.S. since 2021, was detained at the Canadian border due to an expired travel permit, a mistake her lawyer described as a minor administrative error. Despite her son's valid documents, both were transported to a family residential center 2,000 miles from their home, an action her attorney called unnecessary and inhumane.</p>

          <p>Greg Iles, the bestselling author of the "Natchez Burning" trilogy and other popular crime novels, has died at the age of 65. His death came after a long battle with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer he was diagnosed with in 1996 but kept private until the publication of his final novel. Born in Germany but raised in Natchez, Mississippi, Iles was celebrated for his stories set in the American South that explored complex themes of race and class.

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has called on the government to immediately bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the "decimated" healthcare system in Gaza and requested a clear timeline for evacuations based solely on clinical need. The letter also asks that practical barriers, such as biometric checks, be lifted to speed up the process and that families be given the option to claim asylum after treatment is complete.</p>
