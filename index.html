        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses emerging research into delaying or eliminating menopause, questioning the assumption that it's an inevitable part of aging for women. While the loss of estrogen associated with menopause is linked to various health risks, the idea of stopping menopause raises concerns about societal pressure on women to remain young and fertile. Experts are exploring hormone therapy and techniques like ovarian tissue cryopreservation to extend ovarian function and potentially reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, with some advocating for treatments that could benefit those experiencing early menopause. The article also considers the social and emotional benefits of menopause, such as liberation from menstruation and childbearing worries, and the importance of accepting aging rather than constantly fighting it.</p>

It also warns against "do-gooder derogation," where people react negatively to those who seem morally superior and suggests focusing on the personal satisfaction derived from giving rather than moral arguments, using shared rituals like Thanksgiving to introduce the topic of charitable giving.</p>

Trump argues that American troops are needed to slow the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and has designated many gangs and cartels as "foreign terrorist organizations," allocating more resources to counter them.</p>

          <p>This article from DW explores how learning new languages physically changes the brain and increases cognitive abilities, with research showing that neural pathways reshape when learning a new language. The process involves rewiring brain circuits for sound perception and language selection, enhancing connectivity between brain regions involved in attention, memory, and cognitive control. While learning languages as a child offers advantages due to greater brain plasticity, studies indicate that multilingualism improves cognitive skills like memory and problem-solving, though it's unclear if this equates to higher intelligence.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have engaged in a series of moneymaking ventures across Europe, the United States, and the Middle East, capitalizing on their father's name and presidential power. These ventures include luxury hotels, residential towers, cryptocurrency projects, golf courses, and private clubs, with many of these deals directly benefiting President Trump financially. The rapid pace of deal-making has drawn limited public attention despite potential conflicts of interest, with concerns raised about trading on the president's influence.</p>

          <p>New "reasoning" systems from companies like OpenAI are producing incorrect information more frequently, with even the companies themselves unsure why.

          <p>Republicans in Congress are clashing over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are crucial for some of their constituents, particularly in rural Alaska. The potential repeal jeopardizes renewable energy projects aimed at reducing reliance on expensive and polluting diesel fuel in isolated communities like Noatak. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating for preserving the tax credits, while hard-right Republicans are seeking to eliminate them to fund President Trump's agenda, creating uncertainty for businesses and hindering efforts to address looming energy shortfalls in the region.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that Donald Trump's second term has revealed the full extent of presidential power, building upon the excesses of recent presidencies. The author, Jack Goldsmith, contends that the pattern of escalating power grabs puts the country on a dangerous course, citing examples from Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden. He calls for reforms to limit the presidency, restore congressional authority, and consider constitutional amendments to define and constrain the executive branch, ultimately emphasizing the need for a leader with internal checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Stephen Curry scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, and Buddy Hield made nine 3-pointers to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 103-89 Game 7 victory over the Houston Rockets. The Rockets, despite winning 52 games and earning the No. 2 seed, struggled in the decisive game, shooting poorly from long range. Alperen Sengun led Houston with 21 points and 14 rebounds, but the Warriors' late surge secured the series win.</p>

          <p>A security breach in TeleMessage, an app similar to Signal reportedly used by former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, has raised concerns about the vulnerability of communications within the US government. The hacker claimed to have intercepted some users' messages by breaking into TeleMessage's backend infrastructure, though they did not intercept messages from Waltz or other Trump cabinet officials. The incident highlights the risks associated with using unofficial communication platforms for sensitive government discussions, as Signal cannot guarantee the privacy or security of unofficial versions.</p>
