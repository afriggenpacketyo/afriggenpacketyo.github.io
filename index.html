        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a tariff truce, offering temporary relief to businesses but prolonging economic uncertainty. The U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariff on American goods from 125% to 10%. Experts caution that the reduced tariffs are not permanent and could rebound if a long-term trade deal is not reached within 90 days. This CBS News article highlights the potential impact on consumer confidence, spending, and the possibility of a U.S. recession, while also noting that businesses still face added costs with the reduced tariffs in place.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, now 68, has had his 1986 murder conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal after serving nearly 38 years in prison due to new DNA evidence pointing to an unknown attacker in the sexual assault and murder of Diane Sindall. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the court after fresh testing of semen samples from the crime scene. Sullivan, believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history, was released from HMP Wakefield. Merseyside Police has reopened its investigation into Miss Sindall's murder, but searches of the national DNA database have not yet yielded a match.</p>

          <p>Economists and policymakers are anticipating a resurgence in inflation as companies adjust to President Trump's trade war, despite a slight cooling of U.S. inflation in April. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, but experts predict prices will accelerate in the coming months as import taxes take effect. The article discusses the impact of tariffs on consumer prices, the role of inventories, and the Federal Reserve's concerns about longer-term inflation expectations. The article also notes the recent U-turn from the Trump administration on tariffs with China, with officials agreeing to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "historic trade deal" with the United Kingdom is criticized for its flimsiness and limited commitments. The agreement only provides clear and complete rollbacks of tariffs on beef, ethanol, and automobiles, and even then, only partially. The article contrasts this deal with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the U.S. abandoned in 2017, arguing that the TPP would have provided greater benefits to U.S. companies and consumers. This article from The Atlantic argues that Trump's tariffs have undermined U.S. exporters' competitiveness and caused market chaos.</p>

          <p>A fossil found nearly three decades ago in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, has been identified as a previously unclassified genus and species of pterosaur, or prehistoric flying reptile. Nipponopterus mifunensis is the first pterosaur to be formally named as a distinct species based on the fossil. The fossil, a cervical vertebra, was found in 1996 in a layer of rock dating to the Late Cretaceous Period, approximately 66 million to 100.5 million years ago. This article from Kyodo News details the discovery and its significance for studying the evolution of pterosaurs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling 80 shares of Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) due to a reacceleration in comparable store sales and a significant de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The sale is partially offsetting the cash used to initiate a new position in GE Vernova and maintaining discipline due to the slightly overbought S&P Short Range Oscillator. A small gain of about 2% will be realized on stock purchased in early February 2024. The price target was lowered to $195 to reflect increased margin pressure tied to rising beef prices.

          <p>A British man, Peter Sullivan, had his conviction for the 1986 murder of Diane Sidwell overturned after serving 38 years in prison, due to new DNA evidence. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction after Sullivan's lawyers presented evidence from semen samples on the victim's body that the killer was not him. Sullivan, who maintained his innocence, said he was "not angry" or "bitter" about the miscarriage of justice. The article outlines the details of the case, including the initial conviction, the failed appeals, and the new DNA evidence that led to Sullivan's release.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly less than expected, signaling a slowdown of price increases in the U.S. economy. The report notes that the increase, which tracks the change in prices over time for a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, was still above the Federal Reserve's goal of bringing inflation down to a 2% rate. Economists are closely watching the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the full effects may not be evident for several months. This CBS News article analyzes the CPI report and its implications for inflation and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate hit 2.3% in April, less than expected and the lowest since 2021, despite President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The consumer price index increased 0.2% for the month, with the 12-month inflation rate at 2.3%. While some economists feared a surge in inflation due to the tariffs, the data showed a more muted impact, partially due to a rollback of some levies since the initial announcement.

          <p>Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, cooling slightly from the previous month and defying fears of an inflation surge after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. However, analysts anticipate a rekindling of inflation over the coming months as retailers replenish inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect. The article notes that Trump paused a large swath of so-called "reciprocal tariffs" within days of the announcement, and temporarily slashed tariffs on China from 145% to 30%.
