          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have co-authored an op-ed accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of undermining the nation's health security. They cite the recent ousting of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, the cancellation of mRNA vaccine research, and the replacement of expert advisory committee members with vaccine skeptics as key concerns. The former directors, whose service spans both Republican and Democratic administrations, are urging Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the HHS, warning these actions leave the U.S. vulnerable to future threats.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records at the US Open, but questions remain about his physical ability to endure the tournament and win a 25th Grand Slam title. Despite playing himself into good form after a rusty start, Djokovic has been plagued by various physical issues, requiring trainer attention for his neck, shoulder, and back. The article notes his upcoming quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a dominant 10-0 record. Ultimately, his success hinges on whether his aging body can withstand the strain of consecutive five-set matches.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is traveling to Beijing aboard his heavily armored private train to attend a military parade with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The event commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II and serves as a display of military strength and deepening alliances among the three nations. This marks Kim's first visit to Beijing since 2019 and underscores Pyongyang's efforts to strengthen ties with China and Russia amid global tensions. The journey on the slow-moving, bulletproof train is expected to take approximately 20 hours.</p>

The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the Premier League club, calling the move a "dream come true." Lammens, who has yet to earn a senior cap for Belgium, made 64 appearances for Antwerp and was instrumental in their 2023 Belgian Super Cup victory. Manchester United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, praised Lammens as an excellent young goalkeeper with significant potential, noting the club secured his signature despite interest from other teams.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia over the war in Ukraine, he has refrained from implementing severe economic sanctions, a move analysts attribute to strategic calculations. One key factor is the concern that completely isolating Russia would push it further into a strategic alliance with China, potentially strengthening Beijing's global position. This could grant China greater access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic territories. Additionally, analysts suggest Trump may be holding back in the hope of personally brokering a peace deal, a role he believes could be politically advantageous.</p>

          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," directed by Benny Safdie, features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie explores the crisis in Kerr's life following his first major loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse, relationship anxieties, and the psychological toll of his career. Johnson's performance is noted as a strong fit for the physically imposing character, supported by Emily Blunt who plays his girlfriend. While the film doesn't reach the tragic depths of similar sports dramas, it offers an insightful look into the vulnerability behind the fighter's powerful exterior.</p>

          <h2>Trump Demands Pharmaceutical Companies Justify Efficacy of COVID-19 Drugs</h2>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, stating he wants an answer "NOW." His demand comes in the wake of the FDA limiting the approval of new vaccines to high-risk individuals and significant leadership turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director. Trump's comments reflect the ongoing and contentious debate over vaccine efficacy, which has been amplified by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies. The President mentioned seeing "extraordinary" information from Pfizer but questioned why such results are not more public.</p>

          <h2>Federal Data Indicates a 1.2 Million Decrease in Immigrant Workers During Trump's Term</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has fallen by 1.2 million since January. This decline is attributed to President Trump's immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of new immigrants and increased enforcement actions. Immigrants constitute a significant portion of the workforce in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and services. Economists express concern that this reduction in labor could exacerbate shortages, affect economic growth, and complicate the Federal Reserve's understanding of the labor market.

          <p>The UK government has announced a temporary suspension of new applications for its refugee family reunion program. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the move aims to align the rules for refugees with those for other migrants, who typically must meet income and accommodation requirements to bring family members to the UK. The government argues the existing unconditional route has strained local councils, which often have to provide housing for newly arrived families. The Conservative opposition criticized the change as insufficient to address what they term a "border security crisis."</p>

          <p>The European Commission has reported that a plane carrying its president, Ursula von der Leyen, experienced significant GPS jamming, with suspicion falling on Russia. The incident occurred as the aircraft was approaching southern Bulgaria, though it landed safely using alternative navigation methods. A Commission spokesperson called the event an example of Russia's "hostile actions" and stated it would reinforce the EU's commitment to bolstering its defense capabilities. This event is part of a noticeable increase in GPS interference and spoofing incidents reported by airlines, particularly near Russian territory, since 2022.</p>

          <p>Houthi rebel forces in Yemen have detained at least 11 United Nations employees after raiding UN offices in the capital city of Sanaa. The raids targeted several agencies, including the World Food Program and UNICEF, with security forces also seizing equipment. The UN's envoy for Yemen has strongly condemned the arbitrary detentions and demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the staffers. This action follows a recent Israeli airstrike that killed several Houthi government officials, and experts suggest the detentions may be part of an internal security crackdown by the Houthi leadership.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, public radio and television stations across the U.S. are facing a severe financial challenge. Many stations have launched emergency fundraising drives, with some seeing a strong response from their communities. However, stations in more rural and less affluent areas are particularly vulnerable, and some have already begun cutting staff and local programming. National networks like NPR and PBS are reducing dues to help ease the burden, but leaders fear that some smaller stations may not survive in the long term without government support.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has publicly criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees.

He emphasized that the European Union does not have the jurisdiction to deploy troops and urged caution on the matter. The remarks highlight potential divisions among European leaders regarding the long-term strategy and security commitments for Ukraine.</p>
