          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call described as highly productive, focusing on establishing peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy reportedly urged Trump to apply similar diplomatic efforts that were used in the Middle East to resolve the ongoing conflict with Russia. The conversation also covered Ukraine's need for enhanced air defense systems following recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. This discussion marks a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who have previously had a contentious relationship but now seem aligned on Ukraine's potential to reclaim its territory.</p>

          <p>The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, faces an uncertain future under the Trump administration. While a recent court filing suggests the government might resume processing new applications, the Department of Homeland Security has also asserted that DACA recipients are not immune from deportation. This mixed messaging has created anxiety among the over 525,000 active recipients, with reports of some being detained despite their status. Advocacy groups highlight the economic contributions of DACA recipients and the widespread public support for providing them a pathway to citizenship.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is currently receiving radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, his spokesperson confirmed. The diagnosis, announced in May, was characterized by a high-risk Gleason score of 9, indicating the cancer is likely to spread rapidly. However, doctors noted that its hormone-sensitive nature allows for effective management, and the 82-year-old's prognosis is considered good. The news follows recent scrutiny over Biden's health, particularly after he withdrew from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration has initiated layoffs, termed "reductions in force," for more than 4,000 federal employees across seven agencies. The White House Office of Management and Budget confirmed the cuts, which President Trump has framed as part of a broader goal to reduce the federal workforce. Major unions have filed a lawsuit to block the layoffs, calling the move illegal and disgraceful. This action is unprecedented in modern shutdowns, as furloughed employees have historically returned to work with back pay once government funding is restored.</p>

          <p>Two separate shootings at high school homecoming gatherings in Mississippi have resulted in a total of six deaths. In Leland, a mass shooting after a football game left four people dead and 16 injured, with some in critical condition. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is leading the inquiry into the incident, which occurred on the town's main street. Approximately 200 miles away in Heidelberg, another shooting during a similar homecoming event claimed two lives, with authorities still searching for a subject at large.</p>

A reduction of 100 percent would make a product free, and any figure beyond that is not possible.

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they win the next Senedd election. The policy aims to retain teaching staff in Wales by matching the more competitive incentives offered in England, with a focus on Welsh-medium teachers and those in high-demand subjects like math and science. The payments would be conditional on the teachers working in Wales for five years after their training. The party estimates the policy would cost £6m-£7m, funded from money already designated for curriculum support.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson, have filed a motion to dismiss several federal charges against him. The defense argues that the charge carrying a potential death penalty is invalid because prosecutors have not sufficiently identified the underlying "crimes of violence." They are also seeking to suppress statements Mangione made to law enforcement and evidence found in his backpack, claiming he was not read his rights and the search was warrantless. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges in the December shooting.</p>

          <p>A social media post by President Donald Trump threatening a "massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products" caused a sharp stock market sell-off, wiping out an estimated $2 trillion in market value. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell over 3.5% following the announcement. The post cited China's control over rare earth metals as a reason for the potential new duties, disrupting a period of relative calm in the markets. Trump later amplified his threat, stating he would impose 100% tariffs on top of existing ones. (not investment advice)</p>

The disqualification of popular opposition candidate Maurice Kamto has led many young people to question the election's legitimacy and lose interest in participating. Incumbent President Paul Biya, 92, has been in power for 43 years, and his expected victory contributes to a sense of hopelessness. While some youth leaders are still encouraging civic engagement, many young Cameroonians feel their voices are ignored in a political system they perceive as closed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent appearances at sporting events, particularly those involving mixed martial arts (MMA) and wrestling, are part of a deliberate strategy to project an image of machismo and strength. By aligning himself with the aggressive ethos of organizations like the UFC, Trump appeals to a key demographic and infuses his political style with a combative, no-holds-barred approach. This has led to what some observers call the "MAGA-fication of sports," characterized by a noticeable increase in brutishness and a disregard for traditional boundaries of conduct, both in political discourse and among fans.</p>

Critics point to the administration's broad tariffs, which raise costs for consumers and businesses, and changes to visa programs that drive down wages in sectors like agriculture. While Trump maintains the aesthetic of supporting the blue-collar base, his actions are seen as benefiting corporations and the wealthy at the expense of ordinary workers.</p>
