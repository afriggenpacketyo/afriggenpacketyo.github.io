            <p>Netflix reported a strong first quarter, with revenue growing by 13% due to increased subscription and advertising revenue, as the company increased prices across the board in late January. The streaming giant did not disclose quarterly subscriber data, shifting its focus to revenue and financial metrics. Netflix forecasts full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, and net income for the period was $2.89 billion, or $6.61 per share, up from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, during the same quarter a year earlier. The company is also investing in its ad tech platform, with plans to expand into more markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Funding cuts to federal lands agencies by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), particularly the Forest Service, are causing anxiety in tinder-dry New Mexico, with residents fearing reduced firefighting capabilities. The cuts have led to the elimination of hundreds of Forest Service jobs, with potential for thousands more, raising concerns about who will respond to fires. While Trump administration officials claim wildland firefighting positions are exempt, federal workers describe low morale and paused projects, including wildfire prevention grants, due to funding freezes.

            <p>Several Republican-led states, including Arkansas, Idaho, and Indiana, are moving to ban the use of SNAP benefits for purchasing soda and candy, arguing it will improve recipients' health. Anti-hunger advocates criticize these restrictions as stigmatizing and unlikely to improve eating habits, suggesting focus should be on the high cost of groceries, especially fresh produce. The Trump administration signals support for granting waivers to states seeking these restrictions. While SNAP benefits are primarily used for staples, advocates argue taxpayers shouldn't subsidize poor health, while opponents claim officials are being the "food police."</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent comments on autism have sparked backlash from parents and experts, who say his remarks reinforce harmful stereotypes and ignore the diversity of people on the autism spectrum. Kennedy's claim that autism "destroys families" and prevents individuals from achieving success has been widely criticized. Autism advocates emphasized that autism is a spectrum, with varying levels of support needed, and that many individuals with autism lead fulfilling lives. Experts call for more research focused on the needs of autistic people and their families.</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering whether to rescind Harvard University's tax-exempt status, following a request from Treasury Department officials. President Trump has publicly suggested Harvard should be taxed as a political entity, claiming the university has abused its tax-exempt status. Harvard argues there is no legal basis to revoke its tax-exempt status, as it supports its educational mission, and that the tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.</p>

            <p>Andrew Ahn's reboot of Ang Lee's "The Wedding Banquet" lacks the soul and wit of the original, replacing cultural and character-driven elements with a contrived plot involving two couples and a partner swap. The film, starring Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran, and Lily Gladstone, struggles to connect with the audience due to its contrived situations and shallow character development. While the cast is strong, the film's tone feels embarrassed to be a comedy, and its humor is clumsy and desperate. The movie is ultimately a misfire that fails to capture the heart and humor of its predecessor.</p>

The judges wrote that the government's unwillingness to bring Abrego Garcia back "should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear."</p>
