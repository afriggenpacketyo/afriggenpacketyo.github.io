          <p>An opinion piece reflects on how Chairman Mao Zedong warned about the threat of "peaceful evolution" by American imperialists seeking to subjugate China by promoting Western values and inciting dissent against the Communist Party's rule. The author, who was born in the 1960s in China, notes that China has emerged as a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts. The article suggests that under President Trump, the perceived threat of American subversion has receded, as the US has vowed to stop lecturing others on governance. This shift marks a significant change in the ideological Cold War dynamic between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations. President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address lawlessness, according to the White House. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and escalating tensions. The protests began Friday evening and have resulted in clashes between demonstrators and authorities, prompting the federal government to intervene with the National Guard.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy. The columnist emphasizes the importance of open communication, personal growth, and clearly stating one's desires and boundaries in a relationship. Drawing on the philosophy of Erich Fromm, the article discusses the concepts of freedom, self-love, and avoiding masochistic or sadistic dynamics in love. The advice focuses on ensuring emotional security within the existing relationship before considering non-monogamy and suggests a temporary relationship structure to ease into it if both partners are willing. </p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, experienced a significant disruption when their Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was diverted to Rome due to operational limitations related to the aircraft's size. The flight, AA780, had to land in Rome because the 787-9 was too large to land at Naples Airport, which usually accommodates the slightly smaller Boeing 787-8. After landing in Rome, passengers were transported to Naples by bus, a journey of approximately three hours. American Airlines apologized for the inconvenience caused by this unexpected change in travel plans.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of golf in the White House, noting that for much of the last century, golf has been a pastime enjoyed by many presidents, including Donald Trump. Trump's approach to golf differs from some of his predecessors, who maintained a separation between official duties and leisure. Other presidents, such as William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, also enjoyed the game, while Dwight Eisenhower faced criticism for his frequent play. The article highlights how presidents have balanced their love for golf with the demands and perceptions of their office. </p>

          <p>President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs faces challenges in the aviation industry, where there is a growing shortage of skilled workers. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, with many nearing retirement, leading to projections of a significant shortfall of technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are working to attract younger people to the field, offering competitive salaries and on-the-job training. The shortage extends beyond mechanics to air traffic controllers, raising concerns about safety and stifling airline growth.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes the ongoing feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, arguing that their criticisms of each other are partially valid but ultimately hypocritical. Despite their public spat, both billionaires support policies that redistribute wealth to the richest individuals by cutting benefits for the middle class and the poor. The article contends that this shared value highlights a fundamental principle of the Republican Party, which prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced public services. The author asserts that this commitment transcends any personal conflicts between Trump and Musk.</p>

The club's managing director, Andy Rogers, acknowledged special moments during Vilahamn's tenure but cited unsatisfactory results and performances as the reason for the change.

          <p>Colombian senator and presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a BogotÃ¡ campaign event, raising fears of a return to political violence. The attack, allegedly carried out by a 15-year-old hitman, has left Uribe in critical condition. The incident has sparked political polarization, with some blaming incumbent President Gustavo Petro for the country's deteriorating security. The attack draws comparisons to a dark period of political violence in Colombia, leading to calls for greater protection for candidates ahead of the upcoming elections.</p>

Examples of resistance in higher education, the legal profession, and the corporate world are highlighted, showcasing a growing movement to challenge Trump's policies.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes cuts to Pell Grants, potentially limiting college access for low-income students. These grants are essential for financial support, with over 92% of recipients coming from families with incomes below $60,000. The cuts could lead to higher student debt or force students to drop out. The article emphasizes that while the Pell program functions as an entitlement, it relies on discretionary funding, making it vulnerable to budget shortfalls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that anti-Jewish attacks, such as recent incidents in Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, inadvertently strengthen the case for Zionism. The author contends that these acts of violence, by making Jewish life outside of Israel less secure, reinforce the historical need for a Jewish state. The article draws parallels to past events, such as the Holocaust and the expulsion of Jews from Arab countries, which led to increased migration to Israel.

These efforts have empowered women to safely terminate pregnancies outside of formal healthcare settings.
