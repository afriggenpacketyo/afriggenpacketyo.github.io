          <p>London's Metropolitan Police has suspended nine officers and referred itself to the police watchdog following a BBC investigation into conduct at Charing Cross station. The allegations, which are being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), include excessive use of force, discriminatory comments, and misogyny. The Met's Assistant Commissioner described the alleged behavior as "disgraceful" and announced immediate steps to dismantle and restructure the station's custody team. This follows a 2022 IOPC report that found similar issues at the same station.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, to address violent crime in the city. The move is part of a broader administration strategy of using military-led responses in cities run by Democratic mayors. While Memphis Mayor Paul Young had requested financial resources instead, Trump stated the deployment was welcomed by Tennessee's Republican governor and senator. The president also suggested a potential military deployment if needed, framing the action as part of an "aggressive push" against urban crime.</p>

          <p>The Broward County Sheriff's Office has fired six more deputies and disciplined eleven others for their handling of Mary Gingles' domestic violence reports before her murder. This brings the total number of dismissed officers to eight. An internal investigation found that multiple deputies failed to properly investigate Gingles' repeated warnings that her estranged husband, Nathan Gingles, was a threat. He is now accused of killing her, her father, and a neighbor, highlighting a failure to use Florida's red flag laws to remove his firearms.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized The Washington Post for its reporting on the murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska by a career criminal in North Carolina. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused the newspaper of downplaying the need to incarcerate violent criminals by citing experts who called such policies "draconian." The White House argued that the case is a simple example of how soft-on-crime policies fail, a view echoed by the suspect's own mother who stated her son should have been jailed. The administration condemned what it described as media outlets defending criminals over victims.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber routinely denies rides to individuals with service animals or stowable mobility devices, and unlawfully charges fees related to these issues. The DOJ argues that the company has failed to adequately train its drivers or modify its policies to prevent discrimination, leaving passengers with disabilities stranded or unfairly charged. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.</p>

The article suggests that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of official Fed moves, meaning the best opportunity might be fleeting. It also emphasizes that the lowest rates are reserved for applicants with high credit scores, making credit health paramount. Furthermore, buyers are reminded not to let the pursuit of a perfect rate cause them to lose their ideal home, and to secure a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen their offers.

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the jailed mayor of Istanbul and a prominent rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared in court Friday on charges of falsifying his university degree. Prosecutors, who are seeking a prison sentence of nearly nine years and a political ban, allege he fraudulently obtained his degree, which is a requirement for presidential candidates. Imamoglu, who is the opposition's candidate for the 2028 presidential election, has called the charges absurd and politically motivated. His arrest in March on separate corruption charges sparked widespread protests from his supporters.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for one year. The decision lifts a lower court's injunction, allowing the administration to enforce a provision of a recent spending bill. Planned Parenthood estimates that up to 200 of its clinics, many in rural or underserved areas, could face closure as a result, impacting over a million patients who rely on Medicaid for services like cancer screenings and contraception. The organization called the move a "backdoor abortion ban."</p>

Alvarez will defend his four major world titles in the highly anticipated showdown.

          <p>Lawmakers in Missouri have passed a new congressional voting map designed to give Republicans an advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. The plan, which now goes to the governor for signing, would likely eliminate a district currently held by a Democrat by splitting its voters into more GOP-friendly areas. This would shift the state's congressional delegation from a 6-2 Republican majority to a 7-1 split. The move is part of a broader, Trump-endorsed effort by Republicans to redraw district lines mid-decade, which opponents have decried as an illegal gerrymander and pledged to challenge in court.</p>

In response, Benjamin Netanyahu's office characterized Sánchez's statements as a threat, leading to a sharp rebuke from Madrid. The incident is the latest in a series of diplomatic clashes between the two nations, as Spain has been one of the most outspoken European critics of Israel's military offensive.</p>
