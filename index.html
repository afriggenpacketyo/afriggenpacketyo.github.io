          <p>Starbucks is renovating its US cafes to create more welcoming and inclusive spaces, aiming to restore its status as a "third place" for customers. The redesigns will feature cozier seating, warmer wood paneling, and less harsh lighting to accommodate individuals with light sensitivity. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to reverse a recent sales slump by making stores more comfortable for lingering, a departure from previous years where seating and outlets were removed to prioritize mobile orders. The company plans to spend approximately $150,000 on each "uplift" for about 1,000 locations by 2026.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could reach a value of $1 trillion over the next decade. The package involves awarding Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones in profitability, production, and market capitalization. To unlock the full award, Tesla's market value would need to grow to $8.5 trillion, about eight times its current valuation. This proposal follows a previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 that was voided by a Delaware judge earlier this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after an investigation found she breached the ministerial code. The controversy stemmed from her failure to pay the correct amount of stamp duty land tax on a property she purchased, an error she attributed to complex family arrangements and faulty initial legal advice. A prominent figure in the Labour Party, Rayner's rise from a working-class background to high office was a significant political story. Her departure is considered a major blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government just 14 months after their election victory.</p>

          <p>A Michigan couple experienced an unexpected delivery when their baby girl was born in the parking lot of a McDonald's in Schoolcraft. Alyce and Kevin Rotunda were rushing to the hospital when they realized they would not make it in time, forcing them to pull over at the fast-food restaurant. The father, despite a typical aversion to medical situations, successfully delivered the baby, Matilda, who has since been affectionately nicknamed "McTilly."

          <p>The South Korean men's national soccer team is navigating several key changes as it prepares for a friendly match against the USMNT. Star player Son Heung-min, recently transferred to LAFC, may see his role shift, with coach Hong Myung-bo suggesting his seven-year captaincy could end. The team is also set to debut Jens Castrop, a German-born midfielder who will be the first foreign-born player to represent South Korea after a one-time nation switch approved by FIFA. The friendly offers a chance for a fresh start under Coach Hong, who is under pressure to improve the team's performance.</p>

          <p>The Taiwanese government has decided against imposing legal penalties on a former official who attended a major military parade in Beijing. Liang Wen-chieh, deputy minister of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, stated that while the action defied public expectations, it did not fall under legislation that restricts retired officials from attending such events. Taipei had previously warned former officials and generals against traveling to Beijing for the ceremony, invoking its act governing cross-strait relations. The government expressed deep regret over the incident, emphasizing that it failed to uphold governmental dignity.</p>

          <p>A Guardian column by Marina Hyde critiques the proclaimed free speech advocacy of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, labeling it as hypocritical. The article points out that while Farage was in Washington D.C. decrying an "authoritarian situation" in the UK, his own Reform party's council leader in Nottinghamshire was banning councillors from speaking to local press. It also highlights the contradiction of Trump championing free speech while his administration has mandated reviews of museum exhibits to align with his directives and frequently attacks the press. The author argues their crusade is about their own freedom to speak, not a universal principle.</p>

          <p>The once-strong relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly deteriorated, reflecting broader tensions between the two nations. This shift is attributed to punishing U.S. tariffs on Indian goods and geopolitical maneuvering, including Trump's recent outreach to India's rival, Pakistan. The article suggests that Trump's claim of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, which embarrassed Modi, and Pakistan's subsequent nomination of Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, have further strained the "bromance." This breakdown threatens a key strategic partnership that the U.S. has cultivated for decades in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

The constant hum of conversation in the stadiums, particularly Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong, is attributed to an audience more interested in the social event than the tennis itself. Organizers have successfully marketed the tournament as a premier social gathering with celebrity attendees, luxury food, and signature cocktails like the Honey Deuce. This strategy, while commercially successful, has fostered an environment where many attendees treat the high-stakes matches as background noise for their social outings.</p>

          <p>The Duchess of Kent, Katharine, has died at the age of 92, Buckingham Palace announced. A member of the Royal Family by marriage to the Duke of Kent, she was known for presenting trophies at Wimbledon and for her quiet compassion. She carved an individual path, becoming the first royal to convert to Catholicism in over 300 years and later stepping back from public life to work as a music teacher in a Hull primary school, where she was known simply as "Mrs Kent." The Duchess championed music education and spoke openly about her struggles with depression following the stillbirth of a son.</p>

          <h2>Report Claims China's Control Over Critical Minerals Gives it a Military Tech Advantage</h2>

          <p>A report from the Chinese Academy of Sciences asserts that China's dominance in gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor technology is creating a "weapons generation gap" with the United States. China's export controls on critical minerals like gallium are described as a "silent sanction" that hinders U.S. defense capabilities while its own military technology surges ahead. This strategic leverage has allowed China to deploy advanced phased array radar systems across its military at a scale the U.S. cannot currently match. The report frames this as a consequence of Washington's own attempts to curb China's access to advanced chips.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has confirmed a deadly "kinetic strike" against a boat in the Caribbean, killing 11 people identified as "narcoterrorists" from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The unprecedented action signals a major shift in U.S. policy, applying military tactics typically used against terrorist groups to criminal organizations. This follows the administration's recent designation of several Latin American gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. The move has escalated tensions with Venezuela, whose government the U.S. has accused of backing the gang, prompting accusations that the U.S. is seeking regime change.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender John Stones has been forced to withdraw from the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. England manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed that Stones arrived at the training camp with a muscular issue that did not improve as hoped.

          <p>A French couple has been given suspended jail sentences and fines for illegally keeping a black panther named Louise in their apartment. The case gained attention in 2019 when the young panther escaped onto the rooftops of a nearby building in Armentieres, prompting a police and rescue operation. The owners, who claimed they saw the animal as their "big, affectionate baby," had purchased her from a traveling community. The court barred the man from keeping animals for five years, ruling that keeping the wild animal was tantamount to species trafficking and mistreatment.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has intensified as Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani challenged President Trump to a debate, bypassing his independent opponent, Andrew Cuomo. The challenge came after reports that the White House was exploring ways to encourage incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out, creating a two-person race. Cuomo had initially challenged only Mamdani, whom polls show is leading the four-way contest. President Trump has publicly stated he would like to see the race become a one-on-one contest to prevent a "communist" from becoming mayor.</p>

          <p>A new survey on Chinese foreign policy views shows a public divided on whether their country should seek global dominance or share leadership with other nations. The poll, by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Center, found that 41% favor a dominant role, while 48% prefer a shared one. A vast majority of respondents view economic competition with the U.S. and potential conflict over Taiwan as major threats, and only 17% consider the U.S. a friend. In contrast, Russia and North Korea are widely seen as friendly nations, reflecting Beijing's current geopolitical alignments.</p>
