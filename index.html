          <p>In a closely watched Florida special election, Republican Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil. While a Republican victory was expected, the narrow margin of victory—around 14 points—is concerning for Republicans ahead of the 2025 midterms.  Weil's strong fundraising and campaign highlighted the competitiveness of the race in a district Trump won by 30 points in 2024.

Former USAID officials claim that the US was largely absent during the crucial rescue window, contrasting with previous disaster responses.  The cuts, implemented under the Trump administration, resulted in the dismissal of key personnel and cancellation of logistics contracts, hindering the deployment of essential rescue teams and resources.

The high cost of sugar impacts candy manufacturers, while the truck tariff has led to a focus on larger vehicles, hindering competition.

          <p>Leaked messages from HMP Parc prison in Wales reveal prison staff laughing about violent encounters with inmates and making light of self-harm incidents.  One staff member stated that prisoners "need to be broken mentally and physically." G4S, which runs the prison, claims a zero-tolerance policy towards such behavior.  The revelations follow a high number of inmate deaths at the prison in 2024 and ongoing police investigations.</p>

          <p>Norway's government is facing increasing pressure to allow its $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund to invest in defense companies.  Opposition parties argue that the current ban is illogical given the current security landscape.  The ban, in place since the early 2000s, prevents investment in companies producing nuclear weapons components, cluster munitions, and anti-personnel landmines.  The Conservative party cites Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's military buildup as reasons for lifting the ban.<br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>
