          <p>Ballymena experienced a second night of unrest as fireworks, petrol bombs, and other objects were thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and water cannons. The violence, which included setting cars on fire and damaging homes, followed a peaceful protest earlier in the day concerning an alleged sexual assault. Some residents displayed signs indicating the nationalities of occupants within their homes, amidst rising tensions and accusations of racist thuggery. Politicians have condemned the violence and debated the underlying causes, with some pointing to an oversubscription of migrants in the area, while others criticized such explanations as insincere.

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is facing a confidence vote in parliament following a recent presidential election defeat by right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki. Tusk called for the vote to rally support for his pro-European coalition, which has struggled to implement key reforms due to opposition from the outgoing President Andrzej Duda. Critics argue that Tusk's government has achieved little change since coming to power, and opposition leaders see the election loss as a sign of his downfall. The confidence vote represents a critical moment for Tusk's leadership and the future direction of Polish politics. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with disabilities without their consent.

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump has asserted that he possesses the authority to abolish national monuments created to protect historical and archaeological sites. This stance contradicts a 1938 determination that monuments established by previous presidents cannot be revoked. The Justice Department opinion specifically mentions two California monuments designated by President Biden. Environmental groups have criticized this interpretation, arguing that it does not grant Trump the power to shrink monuments at will. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>
