          <p>US independent director Jim Jarmusch has won the prestigious Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival for his film "Father Mother Sister Brother." The comedy-drama, starring Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver, explores complex family relationships.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article discusses President Trump's executive order renaming the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War. The author posits that this change reflects a shift away from the post-Cold War role of the U.S. as a "world's policeman" engaged in prolonged, undeclared conflicts. The piece argues the move signals a new focus on achieving decisive military victories rather than engaging in endless nation-building or policing actions. This change is presented as a return to the department's original purpose of destroying enemies rather than containing them.</p>

          <p>Somerset has advanced to the T20 Blast finals day after a dramatic quarter-final victory over the Bears, secured by Sean Dickson's remarkable late-game performance. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four to clinch the win with just one ball to spare. Dickson finished with an unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls, overcoming what seemed like an improbable situation. The Bears had set a competitive total of 190-6, but Dickson's hitting denied them a spot in the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>A recent military parade in Beijing, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, highlighted significant advancements in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). The event featured the public debut of three new military branches: the Information Support Force, the Military Aerospace Force, and the Cyberspace Force. These new formations, along with advanced weaponry for electronic and cyber warfare, signal China's strategic shift towards integrating high-tech capabilities into joint military operations.

          <p>A tragic incident occurred on the Sassandra River in Ivory Coast when a hippopotamus capsized a boat, leaving eleven people missing. The missing individuals include women, children, and an infant, according to a government official. Three people survived the event and were rescued, while a search operation is currently underway for the others. Boat accidents are relatively common in the region, often due to overloading, but interactions with hippos are also a significant cause of injury and death in the country.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party has publicly distanced itself from comments made by a guest speaker, Dr. Aseem Malholtra, at its recent conference. Dr. Malholtra suggested a link between COVID-19 vaccines and the cancer diagnoses of the King and the Princess of Wales, a claim widely discredited by medical professionals. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the platforming of these views "shockingly irresponsible," while Reform UK stated it does not endorse the comments but believes in free speech.

While some residents in neighborhoods like Canaryville welcome the intervention, many others, including community leaders and violence prevention workers on the South Side, argue it is not the solution. Local officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, have vowed to resist the deployment, labeling the president's plan as "unhinged."

The case highlights growing concerns among psychologists and safety advocates about the potential for AI chatbots to form unhealthy emotional bonds with young, vulnerable users.</p>

          <p>An attack by Boko Haram jihadists on the town of Darul Jama in Nigeria's Borno state has left at least 60 people dead, including several soldiers. According to residents and official sources, armed fighters on motorcycles stormed the town on Friday night, shooting indiscriminately and setting homes on fire. Many of the victims were people who had only recently returned to the area after being displaced for years by the ongoing insurgency. The attack represents a significant setback for regional security and efforts to resettle internally displaced populations in the conflict-ridden northeast.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has intensified its operations in Gaza City by destroying a second major high-rise building, the Sussi Tower, in as many days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the tower was used by Hamas, a claim the group denies. This action follows the destruction of the Mushtaha Tower on Friday. The destruction of these residential and commercial towers, symbols of a period of hope for Palestinian statehood after the Oslo Accords, is described by Palestinian officials as a policy of forced displacement. The UN has warned of a humanitarian disaster as nearly one million people remain in the city.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has stated that President Trump should "absolutely" fire Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams argues that Kennedy's policies, including recent changes at the CDC and restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine access, are "dangerous" and are undermining the nation's public health infrastructure. This call follows a contentious Senate hearing where Kennedy faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans for his approach to science and vaccines. Adams co-authored a bipartisan op-ed warning that the recent turmoil at the CDC is a matter of life and death.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified speculation about a federal crackdown in Chicago by sharing an AI-generated image on Truth Social that parodies the film "Apocalypse Now" with the caption, "'I love the smell of deportations in the morning...'" The post suggests a large-scale immigration and crime enforcement operation, similar to recent National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the threat as authoritarian. A government memo indicates that the Department of Homeland Security has already begun positioning personnel and equipment at a nearby naval station for a potential 30-day operation.</p>

          <p>Joseph David Emerson, the off-duty pilot who attempted to shut down the engines of an Alaska Airlines flight mid-flight, has pleaded guilty to federal charges. Emerson, who told authorities he had taken psychedelic mushrooms and was suffering from depression, was sentenced in state court to time already served, probation, and community service. During the October 2023 incident, Emerson was riding in the cockpit's jump seat when he tried to engage the fire suppression system, which would have cut fuel to the engines. His plea agreement in the federal case, with sentencing scheduled for November, could result in a one-year prison sentence.</p>

By successfully bringing the Democratic National Convention to Chicago, he has further cemented his status as a major party figure. The piece briefly notes that recent gains in cryptocurrency have reportedly made President Trump wealthier than Pritzker, shifting the dynamic of their "battle of the billionaires."</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK conference demonstrates the party's rapid growth and increasing ambition, according to this political analysis. The event, held at Birmingham's large NEC venue, was significantly bigger than previous gatherings and felt more like a major party conference while still maintaining an "insurgency vibe." The article notes the party's efforts to professionalize and build a national volunteer network at lightning speed. Leader Nigel Farage's closing speech emphasized the need for discipline and focus, signaling a serious intent to capitalize on the party's current political momentum and challenge for power.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% since the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imported parcels. According to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the rule change, which took effect in late August, places the burden of customs duty collection on carriers for items valued under $800. This has caused major operational disruptions, leading 88 foreign postal operators to suspend some or all services to the U.S. The number of such low-value parcels had grown exponentially in recent years, from 134 million in 2015 to about 1.4 billion in 2025.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing foreign governments that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens abroad. The order empowers the State Department to designate a country as a "state sponsor of wrongful detention," which could trigger consequences such as economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the new designation is modeled after the state sponsor of terrorism classification and that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will "pay the price." The order is designed to provide the administration with more tools to secure the release of Americans held unjustly overseas.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a significant reshuffle of his government, with major changes at the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office. Ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have been moved to other departments, while Sarah Jones, Alex Norris, and Mike Tapp have been appointed as new Home Office ministers. The reshuffle, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration, and regain political initiative after a turbulent week.</p>
