          <p>A new law in Turkey grants the Diyanet, the country's influential religious authority, the power to ban Quran translations deemed inconsistent with its interpretation of Islam.  Critics argue this constitutes censorship and endangers religious freedom, while the Diyanet defends its actions as necessary to maintain religious accuracy.  Theologians critical of the government have been targeted by pro-government groups, raising concerns about the law's potential for misuse and repression.  This action has sparked debate regarding religious freedom and government oversight of religious texts.</p>
