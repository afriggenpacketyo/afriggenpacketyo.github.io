            <p>Following an attack by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi on prison officers, the UK government has suspended kitchen use in high-security separation centers. Abedi, already serving a life sentence, used hot oil and makeshift blades in the assault, seriously injuring two officers. This decision comes amid concerns about the privileges afforded to dangerous and extremist inmates, with calls for stricter control and containment measures. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the attack and pledged severe punishment for Abedi, while a full review of the incident is underway.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken emergency control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant to prevent its immediate closure and secure raw materials. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is the UK's last producer of virgin steel, crucial for major construction projects. The government intervened after Chinese-owned Jingye intended to halt production due to financial losses, exacerbated by US tariffs and high energy costs. While Jingye retains ownership for now, nationalization is a likely option, though the plant is currently losing Â£233m annually.</p>

While an extension provides additional time to file paperwork, penalties still apply to unpaid taxes after the original deadline. He notes that the IRS is willing to grant extensions to those who need more time, but it's crucial to estimate and pay the owed amount to avoid penalties. The most common way to request an extension is by filing Form 4868, either electronically or by mail, before the April 15 deadline.</p>

            <p>France's far-right National Rally and far-left France Unbowed parties are threatening to initiate no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government over proposed budget cuts. Finance Minister Eric Lombard announced that significant savings would be required to reduce the budget deficit, prompting criticism from opposition parties. While neither party has enough votes to topple the government alone, the threat highlights the challenges facing Bayrou's administration as it navigates budget negotiations. Bayrou's government has so far survived other no-confidence votes.</p>

            <p>Pfizer has discontinued the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, after a patient in a trial experienced a liver injury. The patient's liver enzymes recovered quickly after stopping the medication, but the company decided to halt the program after reviewing all clinical data and regulatory input. This decision adds to setbacks for Pfizer in the competitive GLP-1 market, dominated by weekly injections from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Pfizer is still developing other weight loss drugs.</p>

            <p>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has condemned what she describes as a politically motivated smear campaign after Bangladeshi authorities issued an arrest warrant against her. The warrant stems from allegations that she illegally received land as part of a probe into the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina. Siddiq's lawyers claim the allegations are false and politically motivated, accusing the Bangladeshi authorities of conducting a trial by media.

            <p>US President Donald Trump has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with 125% on US products. Trump has also introduced a 10% tax on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days. He argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but the world economy has been thrown into chaos and prices are expected to rise. Many economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs. The products affected could include everything from clothing to coffee and alcohol to electronics.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that over 60% of CEOs anticipate a recession within the next six months, driven by growing tariff uncertainty. The survey reveals a significant decline in CEOs' views on current business conditions and their expectations for future profitability. Concerns about rising costs and the impact of tariffs on businesses are contributing to the pessimistic outlook. While some CEOs foresee improved business conditions in the long term, the overall sentiment reflects increasing anxiety about the U.S. economy.</p>

            <p>US President Donald Trump suggested that he is indeed considering a new sectoral tariff regime on smartphones, computers and other electronics that our lives depend on. This was the latest development, not long after US Customs and Border Protection uploaded a bulletin past 10pm on Friday night, notifying anyone who might have been refreshing the agencyâs site at that hour that those products would be exempt from Trump âLiberation Dayâ tariffs. The United Statesâ economic dominance has been in place for so many decades that many people alive today have only known such a reality. Washington has dictated the rules for just as long, enforcing them with the power of its currency.</p>

            <p>Dutch exports to China dropped dramatically in March, a sign that shipments from ASML Holding â the world leader in the producer of lithography equipment used to make semiconductors â neared clearing a backlog of orders from China. Under restrictions adopted by the Dutch government under pressure from Washington, ASML is not permitted to sell its most advanced equipment to Chinese buyers. But for almost two years, massive purchases of its lower-end products have pushed Dutch shipments to China through the roof, bucking a broader trend of falling Chinese demand for European goods.</p>
