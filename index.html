          <p>Iran is holding talks with China and Russia to strategize against the potential re-imposition of United Nations sanctions as a late August deadline for a new nuclear deal approaches. European powers have threatened to trigger the "snapback" mechanism from the 2015 JCPOA agreement if Iran does not comply, which would restore international sanctions. Iran hopes its alignment with fellow signatories Russia and China can help mitigate the consequences. The discussions precede separate talks between Iran and European nations, highlighting the intense diplomatic maneuvering surrounding Tehran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, has been sentenced in federal court for his role in the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor. A jury convicted Hankison of civil rights abuse for blindly firing multiple shots into Taylor's apartment, though none of his shots struck her. The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison sparked outrage from civil rights advocates, who called it an insult to Taylor's life. Taylor's death became a focal point in the national movement against police brutality and racial injustice.</p>

          <p>In recent testimony before a House committee, leaders from UC Berkeley, CUNY, and Georgetown University affirmed that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination constitutes antisemitism. This opinion piece argues that their clear stance helps cut through contentious campus debates over the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. The author suggests this recognition can shift focus from arguments over Israel's right to exist to more productive debates about its specific policies and actions. This development is framed as a crucial step for the dignity of Jewish students on campus.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, could be effective in treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. By promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity, these medications appear to indirectly address key symptoms of PCOS, including irregular periods, hair loss, and high testosterone levels. Anecdotal reports and small clinical trials show significant improvements for many patients, offering hope for a condition that has lacked effective, standardized treatments for decades.

          <p>The Texas Legislature has convened a special session to redraw the state's congressional district map, an effort prompted by President Trump's political team. The goal is to create more Republican-leaning districts to help the GOP defend its slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives during the upcoming midterm elections. While state officials have previously claimed maps were drawn blind to race, critics and voting rights groups argue that any new gerrymandering will likely dilute the power of minority communities and face immediate legal challenges.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that a mother and her disabled daughter were found dead in their Nottingham home weeks or months after the mother made a desperate 999 call for help. Alphonsine Djiako Leuga, 47, told an emergency call handler she was cold and could not move, but an ambulance was never dispatched due to an error. An East Midlands Ambulance Service representative apologized for the "missed opportunity." The inquest is examining if the mother died first and whether her 18-year-old daughter, Loraine, could have been saved.</p>

          <p>Three major manufacturers—Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup—are recalling approximately 5 million above-ground pools in cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall follows the deaths of nine children, aged 22 months to 3 years, who drowned after accessing the pools. The CPSC determined that the pools' external compression straps can create a foothold, allowing children to climb in even when the ladder is removed. Consumers are urged to obtain a free repair kit to eliminate the hazard.</p>
