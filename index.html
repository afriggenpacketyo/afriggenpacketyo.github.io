          <p>The Ferrero Group, known for Nutella and Rocher chocolates, has announced its intention to purchase the cereal company WK Kellogg for approximately $3.1 billion. This acquisition includes well-known brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops, significantly expanding Ferrero's presence in the U.S., Canadian, and Caribbean markets. The deal, priced at $23 per share, caused WK Kellogg's stock to surge over 35%. This move is part of Ferrero's broader strategy to grow its international footprint, following previous acquisitions of Nestle's U.S. candy brands and Wells Enterprises ice cream.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. The Pentagon will invest $400 million to expand the company's processing and magnet production capabilities, which are crucial for military hardware like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership aims to reduce U.S. reliance on China for these critical materials, which currently supplies about 70% of imports. The investment caused MP Materials' shares to surge by approximately 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A member of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) was shot and killed in Kyiv, an event being investigated as a targeted assassination. Ukrainian media identified the victim as Colonel Ivan Voronych, who was reportedly shot five times with a silenced pistol. This incident is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks on security personnel since Russia's full-scale invasion. While Kyiv has not officially assigned blame, pro-Kremlin military bloggers have welcomed the killing, suggesting Russian involvement and noting the officer's alleged role in sabotage operations.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own hardware, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to cool the next generation of power-intensive Nvidia GPUs used in artificial intelligence. The company determined that existing commercial solutions were inadequate for its large-scale data centers, which are accommodating the massive energy demands of the AI boom. This custom hardware allows AWS to efficiently integrate Nvidia's latest high-density computing systems, like the GB200 NVL72, into its infrastructure. The move reflects Amazon's strategy of developing in-house hardware to reduce reliance on third parties and improve profitability.</p>

Duffy, a former congressman with no space background, will hold both positions simultaneously. The appointment comes as NASA faces significant proposed budget cuts that critics, including former astronauts and science chiefs, warn could cede space exploration leadership to China. The administration's budget proposal aims to slash space science funding, terminating dozens of missions and prompting an exodus of scientific talent from the agency.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has been ranked as the best state for business in the U.S. for 2025, according to CNBC's annual study. The state's success is attributed to its strong economy, which saw 3.7% GDP growth, and a world-class workforce that is attracting major investments from companies like Amazon and JetZero. Despite its political divisions, both parties in the state support pro-business policies. However, the article notes potential headwinds from federal policy changes, including cuts to Medicaid and FEMA, and a low ranking for Quality of Life due to a lack of worker protections.</p>

          <p>At least two regional Planned Parenthood affiliates, in Washington D.C. and the Rocky Mountains, began refusing Medicaid after a new Republican bill blocked the organization from receiving the funding for one year. This provision, which critics call a "backdoor abortion ban," was intended to "defund" the healthcare provider. However, the ban was quickly frozen by a federal judge's temporary restraining order following a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood. While some affiliates had already started canceling appointments for Medicaid patients, others are now resuming services, highlighting the chaotic impact of the rapidly changing legal landscape on patient care.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," examines the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive and innovative sound system from the early 1970s. The colossal rig, weighing as much as a dozen elephants, was designed to provide a perfect, consistent audio experience for the entire audience by placing the entire PA system behind the band. While a utopian concept, the wall was a logistical nightmare, plagued by technical glitches and immense costs that contributed to the band's eventual hiatus in 1974. The article reflects on this tension between technological perfection and practical sustainability in live music.</p>

The militants reportedly killed at least three sailors and claimed the vessel was sinking; the U.S. has accused the Houthis of taking some crew members hostage. This live report also covers an EU-Israel agreement to expand humanitarian aid into Gaza, where recent Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 31 people.

          <p>As of July 10, 2025, the price of gold is reported at $3,331.03 per ounce. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its value historically holding steady during times of economic or market uncertainty. It outlines the various factors that influence the precious metal's price, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events. The text notes that because gold is priced in U.S. dollars, its value can also be inversely affected by currency fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American neo-fascist group Patriot Front is reportedly present in central Texas, claiming to be involved in disaster relief following devastating flash floods. In a video, the group's leader, Thomas Rousseau, stated they are distributing supplies but prioritizing "European peoples." Experts on extremism note that this tactic is a common ploy used by hate groups to whitewash their image, present themselves as non-threatening, and recruit new members. The group, founded after the 2017 Charlottesville rally, has a history of staging public appearances to gain attention and launder its white supremacist agenda.</p>

Beyond common digestive issues, medical professionals are worried about links to more severe conditions like acute pancreatitis, which has been associated with at least ten deaths in the UK. Recent studies have also found increased risks of musculoskeletal disorders, low blood pressure, and a rare but sight-threatening optic nerve disease.

In a statement, Wallace claimed TV bosses failed to protect him in a "dangerous environment" given his neurodiversity. Disability charities and advocacy groups have responded by stating that autism is "not a free pass for bad behaviour" and warned that such comments risk stigmatizing the autistic community. Wallace, who was sacked from the show, reportedly plans to sue the BBC and producers for discrimination.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service has suspended six of its personnel without pay for their roles in the security failures during the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The disciplinary actions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, come after an internal review of the July 2024 incident where a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally. A Secret Service deputy director acknowledged the event was an "operational failure" but stated the agency is focused on fixing systemic deficiencies rather than firing staff.

          <p>Alaska has been named the worst state for business in the U.S. for 2025 by CNBC, primarily due to its heavy reliance on the volatile oil market. With crude oil prices down, the state's economy is ranked last in the study, showing weak GDP growth and a budget highly dependent on oil revenue. In addition to its economic struggles, Alaska also ranks poorly for infrastructure, particularly its lack of affordable broadband access, and has a notoriously high cost of living. The state has long sought to diversify its economy, but with limited success.</p>

          <p>This in-depth article traces the roots of Los Angeles's severe homelessness crisis back through a century of policy decisions. It argues that a scarcity of affordable housing, not individual failings, is the core issue. Key factors include the demolition of thousands of single-room occupancy hotel units, the halt of public housing construction due to anti-communist sentiment in the 1950s, and a "slow-growth" movement that drastically reduced the city's housing capacity. These decisions, combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs and cuts to social services, created the conditions for the crisis long before it became a visible emergency.</p>
