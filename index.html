          <p>The United States is renewing its focus on the Mountain Pass mine in California as a key strategy to reduce its dependency on China for rare earth elements. These materials are crucial for a wide range of technologies, from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to advanced military hardware. After previous failures and a bankruptcy in 2015, the Department of Defence is now investing heavily to revive the mine and bolster the domestic supply chain. This initiative reflects a growing urgency in American policy to secure a reliable source of these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed revenue expectations but fell short on adjusted earnings per share, causing its stock to decline in after-hours trading. While overall sales grew significantly year-over-year, the company's AI chip business was impacted by U.S. export restrictions to China. CEO Lisa Su highlighted strong demand in the data center and client segments and expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's upcoming AI chips against rivals like Nvidia. The company's outlook for the next quarter anticipates sales growth, though it does not include potential revenue from its China-focused chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has reduced its full-year production forecast after its second-quarter earnings and revenue failed to meet Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to drop. The company now anticipates producing 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, down from a firm 20,000, citing supply chain constraints and a slower-than-expected ramp-up for its Gravity SUV. Lucid reported a net loss of $855 million for the quarter, highlighting the financial pressures from production challenges and a market where consumer demand for EVs has softened in favor of hybrids.

          <p>Snap's stock plummeted over 15% following its second-quarter earnings report, which revealed that its global average revenue per user (ARPU) missed analyst expectations. Although the company's daily active users exceeded forecasts, the weak ARPU figure signaled struggles in monetizing its user base, a metric where peers like Reddit have succeeded. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weak topline growth to a flawed advertising platform update, which has since been reversed, and external economic factors. Despite the miss, Snap projected third-quarter revenue and earnings that are ahead of Wall Street estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a new proposal aimed at streamlining the approval process for commercial drone use in U.S. airspace, covering activities from package delivery to infrastructure inspection. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the goal is to replace the cumbersome case-by-case waiver system with a clear set of rules to foster innovation. The proposed regulations would require commercial drones to meet specific safety standards, including collision avoidance technology, and would prohibit flights over large public gatherings. This move seeks to regulate what the FAA administrator called a "Wild West" environment for unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>

Authorities caution that the poison can be passed to predators and humans who consume the tainted meat, a risk that is not eliminated by cooking.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly instructed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This move explores allegations that political opponents of Donald Trump conspired to falsely link him to Russia. The decision follows claims by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that Obama-era officials politicized intelligence to target Trump. This new inquiry re-examines the highly contentious 'Russiagate' affair, despite previous investigations, including the Mueller report, finding no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023 was a preventable tragedy caused by a toxic safety culture at OceanGate. The 300-page report states the company used 'intimidation tactics' and exploited regulatory confusion to operate outside of established safety protocols. Investigators found the vessel's design was inadequate and its hull had been compromised in previous incidents, with warnings from staff being ignored. The report asserts that OceanGate's late CEO, Stockton Rush, exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of the four other passengers.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell have filed a motion opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her case. Her lawyer argued that releasing the documents would violate the secrecy of the process and compromise her due process rights, especially as her appeal is pending before the Supreme Court. The filing emphasizes that Maxwell is alive and her legal options are viable, unlike the deceased Jeffrey Epstein. This legal maneuver comes amid discussions within the Trump administration about potentially releasing transcripts from Maxwell's recent interview with the DOJ.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to enter negotiations with federal agencies after the Trump administration froze approximately $339 million in research grants. The administration has accused UCLA of violating civil rights laws related to antisemitism, race in admissions, and transgender athletes. The grant suspensions affect hundreds of projects in fields like neuroscience and cancer research. While UCLA administrators expressed hope for a resolution, hundreds of faculty members have signed a petition urging the university to challenge what they call the administration's illegitimate demands rather than capitulate.</p>

          <p>The practice of gerrymandering, or drawing congressional districts for partisan advantage, has escalated into a high-stakes political conflict, exemplified by the current standoff in Texas. With the Supreme Court ruling in 2019 that federal courts cannot block purely partisan maps, both parties have fewer restrictions on creating favorable districts. The fight in Texas, where Republicans aim to secure up to five more House seats, could determine control of Congress. This article explores how this long-standing political tactic has evolved into what is described as a 'blood sport' with significant national implications.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent remarks have intensified speculation about who will next lead the Federal Reserve, with prediction markets showing Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as front-runners. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both men, known for advocating lower interest rates, while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention. The potential appointment is significant as the next chair will shape U.S. monetary policy. Trump has frequently criticized current Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining high interest rates, and a recent vacancy on the Fed Board of Governors gives him an opportunity to install a new member.
