          <p>This article investigates a disturbing trend in cities like Dessau in eastern Germany, where right-wing extremism and nationalist symbols are becoming increasingly mainstream among young people. Social workers and local youth report that Nazi-era slogans and glorification of Hitler have become "cool" and part of a pop culture phenomenon. The piece connects this trend to the region's economic struggles post-reunification and the rise of the far-right AfD party. The normalization of hate presents a significant challenge for the community.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in contraction territory for the third straight month in June, registering at 49.7. This indicates ongoing weakness in the industrial sector despite government stimulus efforts. While production and new orders showed slight improvement, factories continued to see declines in employment and inventory levels. The data reflects persistent challenges for the world's second-largest economy, including sluggish consumer demand and a deepening price war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The suspension was enacted before Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure allows for shipments from most of Japan but maintains the ban on products from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step towards resetting diplomatic and trade relations, which have been strained over the Fukushima water release issue.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness. Research from institutions in China suggests that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs are a primary cause. Specifically, the regenerative braking system, which recharges the battery while slowing the car, produces low-frequency movements that can induce queasiness. This issue of passenger comfort and health is becoming a key consideration for automakers as they continue to refine EV technology for a broader market.</p>
