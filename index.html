          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 24 fatalities, with officials declaring a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, surging 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. Hundreds of people have been rescued, but between 23 and 25 campers remain unaccounted for as extensive search and rescue operations continue. State and federal authorities have pledged full support and resources to the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the nation's highest civilian honor, during a two-day diplomatic visit. The award recognizes the deep historical and cultural ties between the two countries, which date back to the 19th century when Indian indentured laborers arrived in the Caribbean. The visit focused on strengthening strategic partnerships, with India promising investments in Trinidad and Tobago's energy, health, and security sectors. Modi also announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently claimed he has never seen a wind farm in China, suggesting the country does not utilize wind power despite manufacturing turbine components. This assertion was quickly fact-checked, as China is the world's leading producer of wind energy, possessing more than triple the capacity of the United States. The comments were made as Trump's new legislative bill is set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, a move critics argue will stifle renewable energy projects and cede leadership in the sector to nations like China. The article highlights the administration's long-standing opposition to renewable energy sources.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, which is expected to sideline him for six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were alleviated when an examination revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. The team's management expressed relief and confidence that Muncy will return with more than a month remaining before the playoffs. In the interim, the Dodgers will utilize internal players like Tommy Edman, Kiké Hernández, and Miguel Rojas to cover the position, avoiding a desperate search for an external replacement.</p>

          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led to the temporary closure of a beach on the Fourth of July. Drones and lifeguards monitored the sharks, which were observed swimming very close to beachgoers, prompting officials to ensure public safety during the holiday. New York City's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Kaz Daughtry, confirmed the sightings and the brief closure, highlighting the use of technology to monitor the situation. This event follows recent reassurances from Governor Kathy Hochul about enhanced shark surveillance measures along the state's beaches for the summer season.</p>

          <p>A Connecticut law that allows towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizing them is being criticized as predatory. Residents in a Waterbury apartment complex allege that one company, MyHoopty.com LLC, systematically targeted their working-class neighborhood, towing hundreds of cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. Critics argue that the short timeframe and associated fees make it nearly impossible for many owners to reclaim their vehicles, effectively allowing private companies to profit from their hardship. The owner of the towing company defends his actions, stating he is simply enforcing the rules of the private properties he services.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just their Social Security payments, and offers relief rather than a full repeal of the tax. While this will lower the tax burden for some, it does not change the fundamental way benefits are taxed and will not help low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax.</p>

While Prada has since acknowledged the sandals' origins, the controversy has sparked a wider debate about protecting cultural heritage and ensuring artisans are compensated fairly.

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial in mitigating global warming by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then migrate deep into the ocean to hibernate, burning the fat and releasing carbon dioxide far from the atmosphere. This seasonal migration process sequesters an estimated 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The study highlights the underappreciated but vital role these small organisms play in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

The fraudsters identify unclaimed estates on a public government list, then produce fake wills naming a member of the gang as the sole heir, often undervaluing the estate to evade inheritance tax. The report highlights significant weaknesses in the UK's probate system, which has become increasingly digitized and reliant on trust, making it vulnerable to such exploitation.

          <p>A detailed guide explains how the new tax-and-spending package signed by President Trump will affect Americans' personal finances. The law makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces new relief, such as an increased child tax credit and a temporary lift on the SALT deduction cap to $40,000. It also creates new deductions for car loan interest and tip income, alongside new savings accounts for children. However, the legislation enacts deep cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and SNAP, ends many clean energy tax credits, and overhauls the federal student loan system, potentially hurting lower-income households.

          <h2>Federal Judge Denies Final Appeal, Allowing Deportation of Eight Migrants to South Sudan</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-minute request to block the deportation of eight migrants from Djibouti to South Sudan, exhausting their legal challenges. This decision followed a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the path for the Trump administration to proceed with the third-country removal. Attorneys for the men argued that sending them to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties and is plagued by civil war, could expose them to torture or harm. Despite these concerns, the final judicial order allowed the deportation flight, scheduled for Friday evening, to proceed.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American economics professor who has emerged as a key, unofficial backchannel in negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. After receiving an unsolicited call from a senior Hamas official in April, Bahbah began relaying messages between the group and the Trump administration, facilitated by his connections as president of Arab-Americans for Trump. He claims his involvement was instrumental in the "good faith" release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May. This story provides a unique, behind-the-scenes look at the unconventional diplomatic efforts aimed at securing a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at Chester Zoo in the UK. Zookeepers gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. This event highlights a positive development for the Humboldt penguin species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. The zoo is celebrating a successful breeding season with ten new chicks in total, contributing to the international breeding program designed to maintain a healthy and genetically diverse population in conservation zoos.</p>

          <p>Oasis began their highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, delivering a powerful performance that critics are calling their best since the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers, though keeping their distance on stage, presented a united musical front, playing a setlist heavy with classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever" to an ecstatic crowd of 70,000. While the show focused on the music with minimal banter, the performance demonstrated a renewed energy and passion that had been missing in their later years. The concert marks the start of a 19-date tour, ending a 16-year hiatus for the iconic Britpop band.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted a "positive response" to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal, indicating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail, and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day truce with a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but Israel's and the U.S.'s acceptance of the new conditions remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly passed budget bill that significantly increases funding for them. Demonstrators marched from City Hall to the federal building, chanting against deportations and what they called an occupation of their communities. The protest follows weeks of heightened tensions in the region due to aggressive ICE enforcement actions and the deployment of National Guard troops. Speakers, including Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, condemned the bill as a "Big Beautiful Scam" that funnels tax dollars into terrorizing communities.</p>

          <p>Germany secured a 2-0 victory against Poland in their opening match of Women's Euro 2025, with goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, it was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, casting doubt on her future participation in the tournament. The team's performance was solid but wasteful, highlighting areas for improvement as they prepare to face tougher opponents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will increase entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks and give preferential treatment to American citizens in lotteries or permit systems. The revenue generated from higher foreign tourist fees will be used for park infrastructure improvements. The order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the National Park Service, a move consistent with the administration's broader effort to end such programs across the federal government. This reverses the previous two administrations' focus on telling more diverse stories within the park system.</p>
