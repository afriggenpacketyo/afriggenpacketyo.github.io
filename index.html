          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has gained strength as it approaches the coast of the Carolinas, prompting tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm is expected to make landfall in South Carolina, bringing heavy rainfall of up to six inches in some areas and raising concerns about potential flash flooding. The National Hurricane Center has alerted residents to the storm's 60 mph sustained winds and the possibility of isolated tornadoes. Authorities are urging drivers to avoid water-covered roads as the storm moves onshore.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone conversation to discuss pressing international issues, according to a report from Spiegel magazine. Citing government sources, the article states that the two leaders' discussion included the ongoing situation in Ukraine, with a focus on strengthening its air defense capabilities. The call also touched upon trade matters between the two nations. This high-level communication occurred shortly after the United States announced a pause in certain arms deliveries to Ukraine, adding significance to their dialogue.</p>

          <h2>German Retailers Report Significant Increase in Shoplifting</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey of major retailers in Germany indicates a significant rise in shoplifting incidents across the country. The thefts are reportedly being committed by both organized gangs and individuals struggling to make ends meet amid economic pressures. In response to the surge, some stores have been forced to remove frequently targeted items from their shelves. While retailers are reporting record numbers of theft, some criminologists have expressed doubt about the figures, suggesting the issue may be more complex than the raw data indicates.</p>

          <p>Rising tensions over mass tourism and housing shortages on the Spanish island of Mallorca have manifested in anti-German sentiment. In the village of Santanyi, dozens of German-owned shops and cars were defaced with graffiti, including slogans like "Germans out" and "Foreign buyers go to hell." The incidents, confirmed by local police, have alarmed the German community on the island, with one long-term resident expressing fear over the "wave of hatred." For years, local protests have targeted the negative impacts of mass tourism and foreign property ownership on the popular holiday destination.</p>

          <p>Germany is currently grappling with intense debates over its migration and integration policies. Education Minister Karin Prien has suggested the possibility of limiting the number of foreign-born students in classrooms to improve German language proficiency, a proposal met with criticism from integration commissioners. Separately, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is set to host a summit with counterparts from neighboring EU countries to discuss tightening European migration rules. The meeting aims to build momentum for tougher policies on people smuggling and deportations ahead of the EU's new asylum system implementation in 2026.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in German politics as the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) advocate for exploring a constitutional ban on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. AfD leader Alice Weidel condemned the move, comparing it to authoritarian crackdowns of Germany's past. This push for a ban follows Germany's domestic intelligence service labeling the AfD as a group with "confirmed right-wing extremist tendencies." Meanwhile, the left-wing populist BSW party, led by Sahra Wagenknecht, has indicated an openness to talks with the AfD, further intensifying the political debate.</p>

In an interview, she reflected on how this trend can be triggering for those who grew up in the '80s and '90s, an era dominated by the "Kate Moss" physique. Bure emphasized that her Christian faith helps her focus on inner worth rather than external appearance, stating that God's love is not dependent on body size.

          <p>A new clinical trial has shown that a single-injection gene therapy can significantly reverse a form of congenital deafness. The therapy, detailed in Nature Medicine, successfully improved hearing in all ten participants, who had hearing loss caused by mutations in the OTOF gene. This gene is crucial for transmitting sound signals from the ear to the brain. After six months, patients showed considerable improvement, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly her full hearing ability. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, opening avenues for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>Germany is witnessing a rapid decline in the number of active monasteries and convents, as aging populations and a lack of new members force many religious orders to close their historic properties. Between 2012 and 2022, the number of convents dropped from 1,627 to 964, with the number of nuns decreasing by over 40% in the last decade alone. This trend, attributed to secularization and changing societal roles for women, has wide-ranging consequences, including the handover of schools and hospitals once run by these orders.

Police also conducted sting operations, placing the couple in adjoining cells to record their interactions, which allegedly included sexual acts and discussions of marriage. Prosecutors argue this continued commitment after her husband's murder demonstrates a "secrecy pact" and a shared motive to be together after collecting on his life insurance.</p>

          <p>After a dramatic trial, Monica Sementilli was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the killing of her husband, Fabio Sementilli. The prosecution successfully argued she orchestrated the murder with her lover, Robert Baker, to collect life insurance and be with him. Key testimony came from Baker's accomplice, Christopher Austin, who claimed Monica directed the plot via text messages. Despite Baker taking the stand to claim Monica was innocent and that he acted alone out of a desire to be with her, the jury delivered a guilty verdict, and she was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have published a study demonstrating that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is widely believed to enhance the brain's ability to process information effectively. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, established that this genetic influence extends from specific brain regions to large-scale neural networks. The findings also suggest a shared genetic foundation between brain criticality and cognitive functions, opening new avenues for understanding brain function and dysfunction.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew, who was previously charged with the murder of his wife Suzanne Morphew before the case was dropped, has publicly denied any wrongdoing in a televised interview. Flanked by his two daughters, Morphew accused Colorado authorities of having "tunnel vision" and focusing solely on him as a suspect. Prosecutors dismissed the initial charges in 2022 but have stated he remains a suspect. Morphew has since filed a $15 million lawsuit against prosecutors and investigators, alleging violations of his constitutional rights and intentional withholding of evidence, including DNA linked to other sexual assault cases.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the complex investigation into the 2020 disappearance of Suzanne Morphew, leading to the 2022 dismissal of murder charges against her husband, Barry. The case involved bizarre elements, including a "chipmunk alibi" from Barry, a spy pen revealing Suzanne's two-year affair, and data from the family truck suggesting suspicious activity. A judge ultimately dismissed the charges just before trial, citing prosecutors' repeated failure to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence. This included DNA from Suzanne's car that matched an unknown male linked to three unsolved sexual assault cases in other cities.</p>

His absence during the conflict, which included U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, had fueled speculation that he was in seclusion. The war resulted in over 900 acknowledged deaths in Iran and significant damage to its nuclear facilities. In response, Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, further escalating tensions over its nuclear program, which Israel fears is aimed at developing atomic weapons.</p>

The US is the UN's largest contributor, and proposed budget cuts could slash international spending by over 80%, severely impacting key agencies like UNICEF, the World Food Programme, and the WHO. This financial threat is part of a broader challenge to multilateralism, with many countries failing to pay dues and ignoring international law.

The case centers on MI5 providing false evidence to three courts regarding a state agent who violently abused women. This article reveals that MI5 continued to provide misleading information and conceal damning material even during the inquiries, including fabricating an officer's memory loss to explain the falsehoods.
