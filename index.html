          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, that burned across 8,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 3,000 residents has had evacuation orders lifted. The Garden State Parkway and Route 9 have reopened after being closed due to the blaze, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area. While over 1,300 structures were threatened, no injuries have been reported and the fire is 10% contained. Power had been cut to 25,000 homes and businesses to aid firefighters, who are using fire engines, bulldozers, and backfiring operations to control the flames.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones teased the possibility of "two pretty substantive trades" ahead of the NFL Draft, generating excitement among fans who have been critical of the team's lack of major moves in recent offseasons. While Jones didn't provide specifics, the Cowboys have been active in adding players like Kenneth Murray, Javonte Williams, and others to bolster various positions. The team is also focused on a contract extension for linebacker Micah Parsons, with ongoing negotiations to reach an agreement on his compensation.

Former national security officials express alarm, stating that Hegseth has endangered defense department and White House secrets, potentially exposing susceptible individuals in his inner circle to targeting by foreign spies.

          <p>A newly discovered karst cave in southwest China, dating back 480 million years, contains a pristine sediment "gene pool" with unique formations, but is threatened by damage from visitors. Cave explorer Zhao Jieyu, who discovered the cave in 2021, describes crystal flowers, luminescent "cave pearls," and cone-shaped formations created by mineral-rich water. Zhao and geologist Zhang Yuanhai say the calcite deposits have only been seen in hypothetical models before. The cave's newfound attention from state media and online influencers has led to visitors trampling delicate formations and removing crystals.</p>

          <p>The FDA is asking the food industry to voluntarily stop using synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal to replace them with natural alternatives. The FDA move relies on a "national standard and timeline for the industry" to make the switch voluntarily. The agency will collaborate with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes and accelerate the review and approval of new natural color additives. The food dye industry denies safety concerns, while some food industry groups have made voluntary pledges to remove artificial colors from products.</p>

          <p>Senior officials from the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine met in London to discuss a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not attend. The U.S. is increasingly willing to withdraw from the peace process, while European nations insist on continued support for Ukraine. The U.S. expects Ukraine to make major concessions to Russia, while European leaders seek guarantees for Ukraine's long-term security and funding for reconstruction.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand experienced a sharp decline of nearly 13% as interest rates reached a two-month high, signaling concerns about the broader economy.

Economic uncertainty and rate volatility are impacting prospective homebuyers, leading to a cautious approach in the housing market. Comments regarding Fed Chair Powell rattled the market and sent rates lurching higher.</p>

          <h2>Anti-Abortion Movement Embraces More Punitive Measures</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The anti-abortion movement has become more punitive, embracing fringe "abolitionists" and pushing for legislation that treats fetuses as people, potentially subjecting women who have abortions to homicide charges. This shift is attributed to the movement's increasing alignment with Republican politicians and a focus on punishing perceived wrongdoers. The movement's goal is to convince courts that the 14th Amendment already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people, circumventing popular opinion and democratic norms. Despite unpopularity, the movement maintains a strong grip in Republican-dominated state legislatures and seeks to influence the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>An advertising watchdog, the National Advertising Division, has criticized Apple for marketing Apple Intelligence features that were not available at the time the ads were broadcast. Apple has agreed to discontinue a TV ad called "More Personal Siri" that focused on AI improvements to Siri, which were later delayed. The NAD recommended that Apple avoid conveying the message that features are available when they are not. Apple is also facing class-action lawsuits over the AI ads, and had previously turned off its AI summary feature for news apps after users discovered it twisted headlines.</p>

The article highlights historical examples of presidents complying with court orders and emphasizes the importance of clear directives and political branch support. Ultimately, the article argues that the protection of constitutional values relies on the vigilance of the American people.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to record highs as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs have sent the stock market spiraling downward and scrambled markets for traditionally safe investments like Treasury bonds and the US dollar. Investors are flocking to gold, a tangible and scarce resource whose value is not tied to the US economy. Goldman Sachs projects the price will continue to increase, especially if central banks continue buying gold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that a majority of Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death. Concerns about inflation, high taxes, and the size of Social Security benefits contribute to this fear. Gen Xers, nearing retirement age, are particularly worried about outliving their savings. The study also suggests that economic uncertainty and recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration have exacerbated these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
