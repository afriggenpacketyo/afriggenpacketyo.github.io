          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Steady on Interest Rates Amid Rising Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 15:18:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its key interest rate, citing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook and potential risks of both higher unemployment and inflation. The decision reflects concerns over the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies, particularly tariffs, which could aggravate inflation while slowing economic growth, raising the specter of stagflation. While the economy remains solid, policymakers are adopting a patient approach to calibrate monetary policy, closely monitoring trade negotiations and conflicting economic signals. Stocks showed resilience, recovering after an initial dip following the announcement, indicating market participants are factoring in the potential negative implications of trade shocks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has called on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to implement several measures to address ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, including limiting flights during construction, reinstating slot controls, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing the airport's ATC. The delays began following a radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control facility, disrupting flights into and out of Newark. The FAA is taking steps such as installing new high-bandwidth communications lines, replacing copper wires with fiberoptics, and adding a backup system to improve reliability and redundancy, but Kirby insists that more drastic measures are needed to ensure smooth operations at Newark.</p>

          <p>Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik has cautioned that proposed tariff hikes by the U.S. could lead to significant price increases in the affordable jewelry sector. While current tariffs are manageable, reciprocal rates could change the game for jewelry manufacturers who import from Asia. Pandora, which relies on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, faces potential revenue hits from tariffs. The company has modeled various scenarios but expects final consumer pricing to be industry-led, depending on the tariffs imposed after the current pause expires.</p>

          <p>A Florida woman was killed by an alligator after the canoe she and her husband were paddling tipped over in Lake Kissimmee. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) reported that the alligator startled the couple, causing the canoe to capsize, and despite the husband's attempts to fight it off, the woman was fatally attacked. A trapper captured an 11-foot alligator suspected to be involved, but investigators are also considering another large alligator. This incident serves as a reminder of the risks of wildlife encounters in natural spaces, with the FWC urging caution and awareness of surroundings.</p>

          <h2>Understanding HELOCs: Key Considerations for Borrowers</h2>

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners should understand the strategic implications of using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). HELOCs offer a cheaper way to borrow home equity, but come with variable interest rates. Borrowers should consider HELOCs as they are likely to become less expensive in the future, but also understand that there is volatility in the market.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is raising prices on three vehicle models produced in Mexico, citing higher U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles as a contributing factor. The price increases, affecting the Maverick, Bronco Sport, and Mach-E, could reach up to $2,000 per model. This adjustment follows Ford's announcement of an expected $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year. Ford is absorbing some of the tariff-related costs, but warns that higher tariffs could raise car prices by $2,000 to $12,000, depending on the model.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady, the article explores the potential impact on mortgage rates. While the Fed's actions influence the broader interest rate environment, mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which is affected by factors like inflation, economic growth, and investor sentiment. The Fed's pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, but it is not guaranteed. The article advises prospective homebuyers and homeowners to improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and consider various loan types to secure competitive rates.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rates, the article analyzes whether a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan is the better option for borrowers. While home equity loans were traditionally preferred during rate pauses due to their fixed rates, HELOCs now offer lower average rates and the potential for further declines if the Fed resumes rate cuts. Borrowers should carefully consider their risk tolerance and ability to manage variable payments before choosing a HELOC, and ensure affordability both now and in the future.</p>

          <p>Despite pressure from President Trump, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, citing increased risks to both growth and price stability due to Trump's tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and increased unemployment. The decision reflects the Fed's commitment to independence from political influence, guided by economic data rather than political demands. The US economy has shown mixed signals, with some indicators pointing to strength while others suggest a slowdown.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has dropped plans for aggressive Medicaid cuts to fund President Trump's domestic agenda, facing resistance from moderate Republicans and highlighting deep divisions within the party. The decision underscores the difficulty of finding Medicaid cuts that meet spending targets while securing enough votes to pass. Ultraconservative Republicans are voicing their opposition, creating a challenging balancing act for Johnson. House Republicans are struggling to identify $2 trillion in spending cuts to offset tax cuts, with Medicaid proving to be a major obstacle.</p>
