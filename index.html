          <h2>Report Alleges Iranian Control Over Houthi Actions in Yemen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-20 04:00:56 EDT</div>

          <p>A report claims that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei directly oversees the Houthi group's political and military activities in Yemen, with senior IRGC officials commanding operations.  This alleged control contradicts previous statements, and the report suggests a shift in Iranian strategy amid setbacks in other regions.  The report's findings support President Trump's prior warnings about Iranian involvement in Yemen.</p>
