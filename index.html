In an emotional statement, Jesse Merkel remembered his son's love for family, fishing, and sports, while expressing hope that his family can find healing. He also praised the swift and heroic actions of both children and adults inside the church, stating that their selflessness prevented an even greater tragedy. Merkel urged other parents to cherish their children and remember his son for the person he was, not for the violent act that ended his life.</p>

          <p>A fan rushed the stage during a Gavin Adcock concert in Kansas, lunging toward the country singer before being tackled by security. The incident, which ended with the man being forcibly removed, was met with cheers from the audience and a brief pause in the show. Adcock later posted a video of the encounter on social media, highlighting the quick response of his security team. The article notes this is part of a larger trend of disruptive fan behavior at concerts, also citing a recent event where another country artist, Braxton Keith, ended his show early after audience members threw beer cans on stage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to launch significant immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially starting as soon as next week, according to senior Department of Homeland Security sources. These operations are expected to employ tactics similar to those used in Los Angeles, which included armored vehicles and tactical gear, sparking protests. The plans are reportedly separate from President Trump's recent proposals to deploy the National Guard to address city crime, a move that has been strongly opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. The DHS stated its law enforcement is focused on arresting and removing serious criminal offenders from American communities.</p>

          <p>Four senior leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resigned in protest, citing political interference and the spread of misinformation under the Trump administration. The resignations of Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis, Daniel Jernigan, and Jennifer Layden followed the firing of CDC chief Susan Monarez. At a rally near the agency's Atlanta campus, the former officials stated they could no longer serve in an environment where ideology, rather than science, was driving public health policy. They are calling for congressional intervention to protect the agency's scientific integrity from political influence, particularly concerning vaccine research and public health data.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has advanced to the league phase of the UEFA Conference League following a 1-0 aggregate victory over Norwegian club Fredrikstad. This achievement marks a significant milestone in the club's first-ever European campaign, coming after a successful year that included winning the FA Cup and Community Shield. Despite being demoted from the Europa League due to multi-club ownership rules, the team is now seen as a potential contender in the third-tier European competition.

The ruling, by U.S. District Judge George Daniels, stated that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles played by individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers.

This change will subject all incoming shipments to an import tax, significantly impacting online retailers like Temu and Shein that have heavily relied on the rule to offer ultra-low prices to American consumers. The rule, dating back to 1938, has seen its value threshold increase over the years, leading to a massive surge in duty-free imports.

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for approximately 500,000 vehicles, including the 2015-2018 Edge SUV and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX models, due to a potential brake fluid leak. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, which could lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, elevating the risk of a crash. Ford will notify affected owners in early September, although a remedy for the issue is still under development and is not expected to be available until April. This action adds to a series of recalls issued by the automaker this year.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online affiliate, Nottinghamshire Live, from speaking with him or his councillors. The ban, which also includes BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists based at the publication, was reportedly prompted by a disagreement over a story on local government reorganization. Barton accused the newspaper of "consistently misrepresenting" the council's policies, while the paper's editor called the move an "unprecedented" and "direct attack on the free press." The Liberal Democrats have urged national Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to intervene in the matter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve are concerning, the true long-term threat to the central bank's independence is unsustainable U.S. fiscal policy. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where a central bank is forced to subordinate its monetary policy to the government's borrowing needs. With U.S. debt exceeding 100% of GDP and interest payments rising, the Fed faces growing pressure to keep interest rates low to manage the government's debt service costs. The article concludes that regardless of who is president, this underlying fiscal trajectory, ignored by Congress, will continue to erode the Fed's ability to fight inflation effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dell Technologies' stock fell over 5% despite the company reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The decline was attributed to a third-quarter earnings forecast that came in below expectations, even as the company raised its full-year outlook for revenue and profit. Dell's strong performance was driven by a 69% annual increase in its Servers and Networking division, which includes high-demand AI servers. However, the company's storage revenue saw a slight decline, and its guidance suggests that profitability will be more concentrated in the fourth quarter due to business seasonality.

          <p>For seniors facing out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by Medicare, this article outlines several financial strategies to bridge the gap. One key option is Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to cover costs like copays and deductibles. Another tool available to homeowners aged 62 and older is a reverse mortgage, which allows them to access their home equity as a source of funds without requiring monthly repayments. Finally, purchasing an annuity can provide a guaranteed, consistent income stream in the future, offering a reliable way to pay for ongoing healthcare costs and ensuring financial peace of mind.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart. The deal, which could be a club-record transfer fee, is seen as a significant move that may impact the future of current striker Alexander Isak, who has been a target for Liverpool. Newcastle had previously indicated they would need to secure two quality strikers before considering an offer for Isak. The acquisition of Woltemade, a prolific scorer who recently starred in the Under-21 Euros, could be the first step in meeting that condition, potentially reopening the door for Liverpool's pursuit of the Swedish forward.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that current laws are insufficient for preventing individuals with serious mental health crises from obtaining firearms.

The piece suggests that states should follow the lead of California and Washington by implementing temporary, reviewable firearm prohibitions for individuals subjected to such holds. It also calls for closing a federal loophole that allows some concealed-carry permit holders to buy guns without a new background check, thereby strengthening public safety.</p>
