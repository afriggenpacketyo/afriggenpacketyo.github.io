          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a massive military parade in Beijing, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, where he stated the world faces a choice between "peace or war" and "dialogues or confrontation." The event, attended by over 20 leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, showcased China's advanced military capabilities and growing diplomatic influence. Concurrently, former U.S. President Donald Trump accused the three leaders of conspiring against the United States.

          <p>England rugby player Abi Burton made an emotional Rugby World Cup debut, marking a remarkable comeback three years after a severe health crisis. Following her return from the Tokyo Olympics, Burton was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, a rare condition where her immune system attacked her brain, leading to a medically-induced coma for nearly four weeks. She endured a challenging recovery, initially losing the ability to walk, talk, read, or write, and had to relearn basic functions. Through intensive rehabilitation, she defied expectations, signing with a Premiership team and rejoining the Great Britain Sevens squad, ultimately making her World Cup appearance. This inspiring article highlights her extraordinary resilience and the profound personal triumph over adversity.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, reversing recent negative sentiment driven by fiscal concerns and rising bond yields across the region. The UK's 30-year bond yield reached its highest since 1998, and France's 30-year yield hit a 2009 peak, reflecting worries over national budgets and a contentious Autumn Budget in the UK. Global bond yields are also rising due to concerns over former U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and a recent court ruling that could force the U.S. government to repay previously collected duties. This article details the complex interplay of fiscal policy, trade disputes, and market reactions influencing European and global financial outlooks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Open 2025 has ignited a debate over on-court tennis etiquette, fueled by the intense energy of New York City and the high stakes of the final Grand Slam. Incidents involving un-apologized net cords, underarm serves, and body shots have sparked controversy among players and fans, with former champions and current players weighing in. While some, particularly in the U.S., view these actions as legitimate tactics or minor transgressions, others consider them disrespectful and unprofessional. This article explores how the tournament's unique atmosphere amplifies these discussions, highlighting differing cultural and professional perspectives on sportsmanship in tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court panel has ruled that former President Donald Trump cannot use the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of individuals accused of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with immigrant rights lawyers that the wartime statute was not intended for such peacetime immigration enforcement. This decision blocks a key administration initiative, with the court stating that Trump's allegations did not meet the historical levels of national conflict required for the act. The ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's aggressive immigration policies and is likely headed for a Supreme Court review.</p>

Cardi B testified that she feared Ellis was attempting to publicize her pregnancy and denied any physical contact, with a receptionist largely backing her account.

          <p>Google largely avoided the harshest proposed penalties in its landmark antitrust case, as a federal judge ruled against the U.S. Department of Justice's request to break up the company's Chrome browser. The judge cited the emergence of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, as a "game changer" that has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape of the tech industry. While Google was found to have illegally held a monopoly in internet search, the remedies imposed primarily bar exclusive contracts and mandate search data sharing. This article highlights how the rapidly evolving AI market influenced the court's decision, preventing Google from using similar anticompetitive tactics in the new AI space.</p>
