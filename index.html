          <p>HSBC has announced a plan to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private, leading to a nearly 30% surge in the Hong Kong-based lender's shares. This proposed deal values Hang Seng Bank at over $37 billion, offering shareholders HK$155 per share, which represents a significant 33% premium over its recent average price. HSBC, holding about 63% of Hang Seng, aims to strengthen its overall banking presence in Hong Kong and address inherent governance issues linked to parent-subsidiary double listings. Group Chief Executive Georges Elhedery stated the deal would preserve Hang Seng's brand while investing to enhance its products, services, and technology. This strategic move also reflects HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong as a leading global financial center. The article highlights Hang Seng Bank's recent increase in bad loans due to its concentration in the embattled real estate sectors of Hong Kong and mainland China. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate voted 48-51 against a War Powers Act resolution, blocking an attempt to prevent continued U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela. Led by Senators Adam Schiff and Tim Kaine, the resolution sought to require congressional authorization for military engagement against non-state organizations involved in drug trafficking. Critics, including Republican Senator Rand Paul, questioned the legality and potential for escalation, emphasizing the lack of evidence and due process for those killed. The Trump administration, however, maintains these strikes are justified as self-defense against "armed attacks" by designated terrorist drug cartels. Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed the president's authority to order these targeted strikes without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on the "first phase" of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. The agreement, brokered with the help of regional sources and mediators, is expected to see hostages released, potentially by Monday, and will also include the return of deceased hostages' bodies. While procedural issues remain, the deal is slated for approval by Israel's cabinet, after which Israeli forces would withdraw to an agreed-upon line in Gaza. This initial phase aims to end the two-year conflict, with further negotiations expected on complex issues like Gaza's governance and Hamas's disarmament.</p>

Sherrill accused Ciattarelli of profiting from the opioid crisis, while Ciattarelli countered with allegations regarding Sherrill's military records and her fines for failing to disclose stock trades. Trump's influence loomed large, with Ciattarelli giving the president an "A" for his second term performance, while Sherrill gave an "F."

Republican lawmakers, including Senators Joni Ernst and Bernie Moreno, lauded Trump as a "peace president" and even suggested a Nobel Peace Prize, emphasizing the return of hostages. In contrast, Palestinian Americans, such as poet Mosab Abu Toha and scholar Shibley Telhami, expressed deep skepticism, questioning the deal's language, its permanence, and the lack of clarity on crucial details like Israeli withdrawal and the long-term suffering in Gaza. They highlighted past failed ceasefires and the devastating humanitarian cost of the conflict, suggesting the deal might be a temporary pause rather than true peace.</p>

Investigators allege Rinderknecht, a former Palisades resident working as an Uber driver, started the fire on New Year's Day, which smoldered for days before reigniting amid heavy winds. Evidence includes his agitated state, iPhone videos at the fire's origin, and a ChatGPT-generated image depicting a burning forest. This arrest brings a significant development to one of Los Angeles's most destructive wildfires, offering a step towards justice for the victims.</p>

          <p>Eight people sustained injuries when a Metrolink train arriving at Los Angeles' Union Station collided with a stationary, empty train on Wednesday morning. The incident, occurring around 7:30 a.m., led to one passenger being hospitalized and six others, along with the train conductor, suffering minor injuries. Ventura County Line Train 104, carrying 85 passengers, struck an unoccupied Metrolink train at the platform, leading to the cancellation of two subsequent San Bernardino Line trains. The cause of this collision is currently under investigation by Metrolink's safety, security, and compliance department. Fortunately, the operational impact was not severe due to the frequent schedule of San Bernardino Line trains.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has seen its membership nearly halve over the past five years, falling from almost 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000 members. This decline occurred despite the party achieving its most successful general election ever in terms of seats won last year. The drop was partly masked by the inclusion of "registered supporters" in annual figures, who do not hold full membership rights. Experts suggest the decrease is surprising given electoral success but might be linked to a lower public profile and reduced chances of entering government. However, research indicates Lib Dem members are highly active in canvassing voters, which can be crucial in close races.</p>

Trump's private fixation on his legal convictions fuels his desire for retribution, which is now being carried out by a pliant Attorney General and federal government. The article details how initial White House claims of focusing on policy shifted to retaliation, especially after the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proved unpopular and his poll numbers slipped.

The new policy requires reporters to acknowledge understanding policies that could lead to loss of credentials for unauthorized disclosure of classified or "controlled unclassified information," even if unclassified. While the Pentagon dropped the requirement for reporters to *agree* to the policy, the press corps argues it still threatens First Amendment rights by discouraging the use of unnamed sources.

Owners speculate the Cybertruck's substantial weight, over 6,000 pounds, and instant torque contribute to the accelerated degradation. The article emphasizes the importance of tire durability for safety, citing federal statistics on tire-related crashes. While the Cybertruck has faced disappointing sales since its 2023 launch, regular maintenance and careful driving are suggested as ways for owners to extend tire life and mitigate the high cost of ownership.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is intensifying over the central Atlantic Ocean and is projected to become a hurricane later this week or over the weekend. The tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Jerry currently has maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and is moving west-northwest. While it poses no immediate threat to southern Florida, a tropical storm watch has been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, where 2-4 inches of rain and a risk of flash flooding are expected. Forecasters also warn that swells generated by Jerry will reach the Leeward and Windward Islands, potentially causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.</p>

          <p>Portland, Oregon, is experiencing growing anxiety amidst President Trump's efforts to deploy the National Guard to quell protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Despite protests being largely contained, Trump's rhetoric describing Portland as "war-ravaged" has significantly damaged the city's image and business. Local business owners report severe declines since the 2020 pandemic and social justice protests, further exacerbated by the president's statements. A federal judge initially blocked the deployment of Oregon and other states' National Guard troops, though an appeals court temporarily granted the White House's request for Oregon troops to remain under federal control, albeit still prohibited from deployment to Portland.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm off Mexico's Pacific coast, with sustained winds now at 65 mph. The storm, which developed over the weekend, is moving northwest and is expected to continue weakening over the next 48 hours. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for parts of Baja California Sur, including Cabo San Lucas. While Priscilla no longer holds hurricane strength, forecasters warn that it continues to generate large swells affecting coastal areas of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as southern Baja California. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal charges of lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation, stemming from his 2020 Senate testimony. Comey's arraignment in Alexandria, Virginia, saw him released on his own recognizance, with a trial date set for early January. His legal team plans to challenge the indictment, citing potential vindictive prosecution and questioning the validity of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment. This prosecution represents a significant escalation in President Trump's efforts against political adversaries, as Trump had publicly urged action against Comey. The case involves complex legal and political dimensions, including the potential handling of classified information.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning to decorate for the holidays should shop early due to warnings of limited inventory and higher prices for artificial Christmas trees, lights, and wreaths. A major importer, National Tree Company, reports bringing in 25% less product and raising prices by 10% because of trade war tariffs. CEO Chris Butler advises consumers to buy now, ahead of the Black Friday peak, to secure desired items. This situation, combined with concerns about weaker consumer demand and significant year-over-year declines in import volumes, suggests a challenging holiday retail season.

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, expressed skepticism during arguments in a case challenging Illinois' voting regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election. Republican Rep. Michael Bost sued, claiming harm despite winning, arguing the rule lowered his victory margin and incurred staff costs. Justices questioned the standing of candidates who win or have no chance of winning to challenge election rules. They criticized Bost's complaint for lacking specific facts and Illinois' argument for potentially creating a "disaster" by limiting who can sue.

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Wyoming's Campbell County, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amid a dispute over books with sexual and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who sued over her termination, felt "vindicated" by the settlement, asserting she stood up for the First Amendment. She had been dismissed in 2023, two years into the controversy, where public officials in the conservative area sided with objectors seeking to remove the books from youth shelves. Lesley's attorney hopes the outcome sends a message to other library districts about constitutional obligations against discrimination. A separate lawsuit against individuals who contested the books will continue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center, his second since returning to the White House in January. The White House press secretary stated that Trump will also meet with troops and make remarks during his visit. This follows an April examination that included cognitive and cardiology tests, after which his physician declared him "fully fit" for the presidency. Concerns about the president's health, including a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency and bruising on his hand, have fueled online speculation, which Trump has publicly dismissed.

Thousands of IRS workers have been furloughed, and vital programs like WIC, which supports low-income mothers and babies, are running out of funds.

The village, near the front lines in Zaporizhzhia, was occupied in February 2022, and satellite images show a well-used path leading to his apparently abandoned house, particularly during winter. Local residents are afraid to speak due to the lawless conditions and risk of retribution from Russian forces. A Ukrainian military spokesman confirms it is "extremely likely" that Russian military personnel are occupying vacant houses in frontline areas.
