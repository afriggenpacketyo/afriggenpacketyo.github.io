          <p>President Trump's consideration of accepting a $400 million Boeing 747-8 from Qatar's royal family as a temporary Air Force One replacement has drawn scrutiny due to ethical and legal concerns, with critics like Bernie Sanders labeling it "farcically corrupt." Trump defends the potential gift as a transparent transaction to benefit the Defense Department amid Boeing manufacturing delays. Qatar's media attach√© clarified that the matter is still under review by legal departments and no final decision has been made, while the White House insists any gift would comply with all applicable laws.

The article also notes that some industries are facing inventory shortages and that the trade pause may lead to a spike in ocean freight prices.

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was denied over $600,000 in public matching funds after the New York City Campaign Finance Board determined he likely coordinated ad language with a super PAC. The board found that his campaign posted detailed spending instructions on its website, which the super PAC, Fix the City, appeared to follow in an ad. While Cuomo still received $1.5 million in public funds, the penalty marks an embarrassing setback. The article details the allegations of coordination and the board's response.</p>
