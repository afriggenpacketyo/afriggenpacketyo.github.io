          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since announcing the successor to the Switch. The company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 24.7%, and profit plunged nearly 50% year-over-year, as consumers await the new console. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns about potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. on consoles manufactured in Vietnam, which could decrease demand in the U.S. market. The company delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump's tariffs.</p>

The power outage affected 66,919 customers, and led to the disruption of more than 270,000 journeys.

While Christie's family supports the project and emphasizes that it uses her own words, some ethicists argue that it's problematic to represent the views of someone who cannot consent.

          <p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) has revealed a takeover bid of 2.37 trillion yen to make NTT Data Group Corp. a 100% owned subsidiary. This move aims to enhance the competitiveness of NTT's overseas businesses, which are primarily managed by NTT Data. NTT, which already holds approximately 58% of NTT Data Group shares, will acquire the remaining stock through a tender offer, leading to the delisting of NTT Data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by climate scientists has found that the severe storms in the central Mississippi valley in early April were made more likely and intense by the burning of fossil fuels. The record rainfall, which caused catastrophic flooding and numerous deaths, was made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change. The warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by the climate crisis, fueled the storm's moisture. The study also highlights concerns about staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which played a crucial role in issuing early warnings.</p>

The analysis reveals that certain variants may even be launched from space-based platforms, drastically compressing the adversaryâ€™s early-warning system response time.

The study also found that unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, elevated by climate change, made the storms 14 times more likely.

He refutes claims that gangs control prisons but admits that serious organized crime is a major concern.
