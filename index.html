          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second consecutive night of unrest as protesters clashed with police, throwing fireworks, petrol bombs, and other objects. Seventeen officers were injured, adding to the fifteen from the previous night, and five people were arrested for riotous behavior. The protests were sparked by a case involving two teenage boys accused of sexual assault, escalating tensions in the town. The violence, described by police as "racist thuggery," has led to property damage and fears of further escalation, with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationalities. The unrest underscores deeper societal issues related to immigration and justice within the community. The situation appears to be calming down, but tensions remain high. Optimism score is based on the fact that the violence is not escalating, though is still a serious situation.</p>

          <p>Proxima Fusion, a German startup, has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round to develop a commercial nuclear fusion power plant. This represents the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date, highlighting growing interest in fusion energy as a potential solution for the energy transition. Nuclear fusion, the process powering the sun and stars, promises virtually limitless clean and affordable energy if replicated at an industrial scale. While challenges remain in scaling the technology for commercial use, Proxima Fusion aims to bring the first European fusion power plant online within the next decade. This advancement could significantly shift global energy dependence from natural resources to technological leadership.</p>

          <p>A court ruling ordering the Tokyo government and the state to compensate a company president and others for an unlawful investigation has been finalized after the parties gave up appealing. Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two others will receive about 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages, recognizing their arrests and indictments as illegal. The case involved the export of spray-drying apparatus suspected of being used in biological weapons production. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation, with a Tokyo police investigator testifying that the case was "fabricated." The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry had questioned the police's legal interpretation, but the police proceeded with the arrests anyway. This outcome highlights the importance of accountability and oversight in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Shares of Inditex, the owner of Zara, fell after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and indicated a slower start to the summer season due to broader economic uncertainty. The company's first-quarter revenues were 8.27 billion euros, slightly below analysts' forecasts, and summer sales growth slowed to 6% compared to 12% the previous year. Inditex, which also owns brands like Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti, is seen as a barometer for consumer sentiment, and the company noted the unclear impact of tariffs on consumer spending. The retailer is closely monitoring the economic environment as it navigates these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

A US delegation held meetings with Indian trade ministry officials in Delhi, with both sides expressing optimism for a mutually beneficial agreement. The US remains India's largest trading partner, with both countries aiming to increase bilateral trade to $500bn. (not investment advice)</p>
