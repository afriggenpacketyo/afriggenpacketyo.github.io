          <p>House Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin, are investigating President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million private jet from Qatar, questioning the legality under the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. They're seeking legal memos and communications related to the transfer, suggesting the gift might be a bribe, especially since Trump plans to donate the plane to his presidential library. Democrats highlight a potential conflict of interest with Attorney General Pam Bondi, who previously lobbied for Qatar. Speaker Mike Johnson skirted around the issue, while Trump defended his acceptance of the plane on Truth Social, arguing it was a free gift to the Defense Department.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against nearly 100 migrants arrested for entering a newly declared ‚Äúnational defense‚Äù zone along the border with Mexico. Judge Gregory B.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the Trump administration's efforts to end birthright citizenship, with justices raising concerns about the policy's implementation and legality. The administration argues that district court judges lacked authority to issue nationwide injunctions against the policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. Justice Kagan noted that every court has ruled against the administration, while Justice Kavanaugh questioned the feasibility of implementing such a policy quickly. The ACLU argues that the administration is attempting to limit access to courts and undermine constitutional rights.</p>

The move comes just six months after Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution. The initiative will appear on the November 2026 ballot unless Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election sooner. If it passes, the amendment would prohibit abortions, except in cases of medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, sexual assault, or incest.</p>
