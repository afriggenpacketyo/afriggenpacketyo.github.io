          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet, of lying to the Supreme Court amidst a legal battle over Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss him. Netanyahu submitted a 13-page affidavit refuting Bar's allegations that the decision to remove him stemmed from a desire for personal loyalty rather than professional reasons. Watchdog organizations and opposition parties have challenged Netanyahu's decision, citing a lack of trust as the reason for Bar's ouster, leading to this extraordinary exchange of accusations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians are cautiously optimistic following President Trump's recent comments questioning why Russia's President Putin would continue attacking Ukraine while the United States seeks peace negotiations. Trump suggested that Putin may not want to end the war and might require a different approach, potentially involving more sanctions. This sentiment offers a small hope to Ukraine, which has rejected a US-backed peace plan that would require abandoning NATO aspirations and recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Trump's rare rebuke of Putin after a missile attack on Kyiv has further fueled this cautious optimism.</p>
