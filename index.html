          <p>Vance Luther Boelter was apprehended in a rural area of Sibley County, Minnesota, as the suspect in the politically motivated assassination of Minnesota Democratic state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack; both were in stable condition at the time of Boelter's arrest. Authorities believe Boelter acted alone, donning a latex mask and law enforcement-style uniform before attacking the Hortmans and Hoffmans at their homes, but they have not ruled out the possibility of an accomplice. The arrest was made without violence, and Boelter is currently being interviewed at a law enforcement facility.</p>

The article highlights Jakob's achievements, such as becoming the youngest person to run a sub-four-minute mile, and winning gold medals at the European Championships.

          <p>Israeli airstrikes in Iran have entered their fourth day, targeting command centers, military bases, and nuclear sites belonging to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Ordinary Iranians are caught in the middle, facing a lack of shelters and growing fear, with reports of civilian casualties, including women and children. Some Iranians express more confidence in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) than their own government, citing concerns over Iranian projectiles falling in residential areas. The conflict raises the possibility of regime change in Iran, with opposition parties calling for renewed mass mobilization, while economic experts warn of a potential currency crisis and mass unrest.</p>

          <p>Stands belonging to major Israeli defense firms, including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), were blocked off at the Paris Air Show, reportedly ordered by the French government following a dispute over the displays. Israel's Defense Ministry stated that the exhibition organizers, acting on behalf of the French government, demanded the removal of offensive weapons systems from Israeli defense industry pavilions. The ministry rejected this demand, leading to the erection of black walls overnight, effectively blocking the pavilions for the start of the event. Israel's Defense Ministry criticized the decision as outrageous and unprecedented, suggesting it was driven by political and commercial considerations.</p>

The efforts have prevented an estimated 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013, but experts acknowledge that complete eradication is unlikely.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are introducing a bill to cut off housing funds to sanctuary cities, such as Los Angeles, that do not comply with federal law and immigration authorities. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Bill Hagerty and Rep. Ralph Norman, targets federal housing grants provided by the Community Development Block Grant program. It seeks to revoke funding from sanctuary jurisdictions that impede the sharing of information about individuals' immigration status or block compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requests. This measure aligns with President Donald Trump's broader efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities and revoke federal funding from non-compliant areas.</p>

The proposed measures include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for disabled individuals and scrapping the work capability assessment by 2028. The government wants more frequent reassessments for Pip claimants, but those with severe, long-term conditions will no longer face reassessments. Critics argue that the welfare package could push an extra 250,000 people into relative poverty, but Starmer insists that those who can work should work, and those who need support should receive it.</p>

          <p>Energy efficiency standards, which have historically driven savings, are now facing political scrutiny under the Trump administration. The administration is rescinding dozens of energy-efficiency rules, claiming to save Americans billions, while the Biden administration previously pushed for stricter standards, like those for gas stoves and microwaves. While some argue that stricter standards harm performance, the appliance industry relies on federal guidelines for streamlining expectations. Eliminating these standards could result in higher electricity bills, and the debate centers on balancing energy production with conservation in the face of rising demand from exports and AI data centers.</p>

          <p>Flash flooding in northern West Virginia, caused by torrential rains, has resulted in at least five deaths, including a 3-year-old child, with rescue crews searching for missing individuals. Officials reported that 2.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about half an hour, overwhelming local waterways and infrastructure. Vehicles were swept into swollen creeks, and a mobile home caught fire, prompting swift water rescues. Governor Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Ohio and Marion County, warning residents to stay off the roads due to ongoing storm risks.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 kilograms of premium Sato Nishiki cherries, valued at around 1 million yen ($7,000), have been stolen from an orchard in Kaminoyama, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. The theft was discovered by the 74-year-old owner, who reported that only the Sato Nishiki variety trees, numbering around 50, had their fruit stripped. Yamagata Prefecture is the top producer of cherries in Japan, but experienced a record-poor harvest last year due to extreme heat, making the stolen fruit particularly valuable.

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, implemented in January, has significantly transformed traffic conditions in lower Manhattan, with 70,000 fewer vehicles entering the congestion zone each day. The $9 toll aims to reduce traffic and raise funds for public transit, and has resulted in faster bus routes and increased public transit ridership. Traffic crashes and injuries have decreased in areas outside the toll zone, such as Astoria and Long Island City, and noise complaints have dropped along Manhattan's busiest streets. Despite initial opposition, public sentiment has improved, and the program is now threatened by the Trump administration, leading to legal battles over its future.</p>
