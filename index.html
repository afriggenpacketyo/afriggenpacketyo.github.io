          <p>The Israel Defense Forces announced a series of preemptive strikes against Iran, targeting military sites including the country's nuclear program, prompting immediate reactions from the US. Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency, anticipating missile and drone attacks. Air raid sirens were activated in Tel Aviv following the announcement. While the U.S. denied involvement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed that the U.S. was advised of Israel's actions and emphasized the protection of American forces, as Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian vowed to continue uranium enrichment and rebuild any destroyed facilities. The situation has escalated tensions in the Middle East significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has sided with California in a dispute over President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles, issuing a temporary ruling that requires the president to return control of the Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by California, arguing that Trump's deployment of the Guard to assist with immigration enforcement was unlawful and an overreach of federal power. Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts lack the authority to review the president's decision. California officials argued that local law enforcement could manage the protests and that the military presence escalated tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research from Chinese and US institutions indicates that pigs may have been domesticated in southern China as early as the Neolithic period, around 8,000 years ago. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings suggest that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>

          <p>Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen addressed his viral outburst after losing a classical match against Gukesh Dommaraju at the Norway Chess 2025 tournament. Speaking on the "Pardon My Take" podcast, Carlsen expressed regret over his actions, explaining that losses can be more impactful than wins are satisfying. He said that he felt "washed and useless" after the loss. While he doesn't aspire to be a "bad boy" of chess, Carlsen believes there should be room for emotional expression in the sport, comparing it to smashing a racket in tennis.</p>

The drug, bound to an antibody that targets plasma cells, releases its toxic payload inside cancerous cells, killing the cancer. Clinical trials showed it halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with existing therapies.</p>

          <p>Ongoing ICE raids in Los Angeles have led undocumented street vendors to limit their work, fearing arrest and deportation. The need for economic security clashes with the risk of apprehension, creating a difficult situation for vendors. Some vendors have canceled appointments to secure permits due to concerns about providing information to the IRS. The reduced presence of vendors has also affected their customers, with fewer people patronizing businesses like taco trucks.</p>
