          <p>A powerful storm system swept through the Northeast, causing destructive winds, downed trees, and widespread power outages, particularly in Pennsylvania. At least four people died in Pennsylvania due to electrocution or falling trees, with over 400,000 customers without power. Pittsburgh's mayor urged residents to stay home as crews worked to clear debris. The storm also affected southern Quebec, leaving thousands without power amid thunderstorms and hail. The National Weather Service confirmed multiple tornadoes across several states, although the storm activity has since moved offshore, bringing quieter weather to the Northeast. Optimism score is low due to the fatalities and extensive damage.</p>
