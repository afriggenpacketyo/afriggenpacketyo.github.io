          <p>Jannik Sinner defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to win the Wimbledon men's singles final, marking a historic first for an Italian player at the tournament. The victory was a redemptive moment for the 23-year-old, who had suffered a difficult loss to Alcaraz at the French Open just a month prior. After losing the first set, Sinner rallied to win the next three, sealing the championship with a powerful 137 mph ace. The match highlighted the growing rivalry between the world's top two male tennis players.</p>

          <p>England footballers Ella Toone and Beth Mead have formed a close bond through the shared experience of losing a parent, a connection that has supported them during the Euro 2025 tournament. Both players scored in a recent victory over Wales, dedicating their goals to their late parents. Toone, who lost her father to cancer, praised Mead for her support, as Mead had previously lost her mother to the same disease.

          <h2>Psychiatrist Warns Late-Night TV Bingeing Can Negatively Impact Brain Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 18:38:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen, habitually staying up late to watch television can be detrimental to brain health by depriving it of essential sleep. He explains that during sleep, the brain undergoes a cleaning process that is crucial for memory, focus, and energy the following day. Cutting sleep short for entertainment can impair decision-making abilities. The article also notes that exposure to blue light from screens before bed can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep, and recommends using blue-light blockers to promote rest.</p>

The hospital confirmed it has seen a surge in seriously unwell children admitted with the highly contagious virus, treating 17 patients since June. Officials attribute the spike to a decline in measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake in the area. Health experts are urging parents to vaccinate their children, emphasizing that the illness can lead to serious complications and, in rare cases, death.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died in London at the age of 82 after a prolonged illness. A polarizing figure, he first led the country in the 1980s after a coup, implementing a repressive anti-corruption campaign. He later returned to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023, a tenure marked by economic decline and widespread insecurity despite initial hopes for change. Despite a fraught legacy, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north, for his austere public image.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators is advancing a sanctions bill that would provide President Trump with powerful economic leverage against Russia and its allies. Senator Lindsey Graham described the legislation as a "sledgehammer" that would allow the president to impose tariffs up to 500% on any country aiding Russia's war effort. The move comes as Trump has expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin and signals a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to the war in Ukraine. The bill has gained significant momentum and is seen as a way to pressure the Kremlin to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old Mexican farmworker has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in California. The worker, Jaime Alanis, reportedly climbed the roof in an attempt to evade agents when he fell approximately 30 feet. Trump's "border czar" Tom Homan called the death "unfortunate" but defended the agents, stating the man was not in ICE custody at the time of the fall. The raid, which led to around 200 arrests, has sparked criticism and highlighted the dangers of increased immigration enforcement actions.</p>
