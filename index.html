          <p>A construction tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles, trapping at least 15 people inside. The Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed extensive resources, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, to the site on South Figueroa Street. The collapse occurred within the $630.5 million Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project, which is designed to repair aging wastewater infrastructure. Communication with the trapped individuals has been lost, complicating the difficult rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new one-time subsidy for companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) for each new hire who is kept on for at least three months with full social insurance contributions. This policy is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and address persistent youth unemployment amid economic challenges. The initiative will be funded through the country's unemployment insurance reserves and will run until the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a safety warning following a rise in kidnappings targeting Chinese nationals, particularly women. Recent incidents in provinces like Gauteng and the Eastern Cape have prompted the embassy to advise its citizens to avoid going out alone. Analysts suggest that Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they carry large amounts of cash and operate outside the formal banking system. The warning comes amid a general increase in kidnapping cases across South Africa this year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has filed a lawsuit against the state of California, alleging its state-level regulations on chicken and egg farms are contributing to soaring egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit argues that California's anti-animal cruelty laws, which mandate specific living conditions for hens, impose "unnecessary red tape" and violate federal law by affecting interstate commerce. This legal action is part of the administration's broader effort to combat inflation and rising food costs. The state's regulations have previously survived legal challenges from other states.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The decision was made following a national security assessment that highlighted copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies. The administration aims to revitalize the domestic copper industry, as the U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper supply, primarily from Chile. The announcement caused an immediate surge in U.S. copper prices, reflecting anticipated market shifts and supply constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California's Life Expectancy Has Not Fully Recovered to Pre-Pandemic Levels</h2>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially rebounded since its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the average lifespan remains nearly a year shorter than it was in 2019, with only two-thirds of the pandemic-era loss recovered. While COVID-19 was the initial driver, the persistent gap is now largely attributed to increases in deaths from drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The study also highlights significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic populations experiencing a much slower recovery in life expectancy.</p>

          <p>A senior Iranian official publicly threatened President Trump, suggesting he could be targeted by a drone strike. Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, stated on Iranian television that Trump "can no longer sunbathe in Mar-a-Lago" because a small drone might strike him. The remark was made during a discussion about Iran's military technology. This direct and imaginative threat from a figure within the Iranian regime represents a significant escalation in rhetoric between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, a United Nations special rapporteur, for her investigation and criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza. U.S. officials accused Albanese of expressing support for terrorism and contempt for the United States and its allies. The move is the latest in a campaign against international bodies and officials seen as critical of Israeli policy, including the International Criminal Court. Albanese, who has called for multinational companies to cease business with Israel, described the sanctions as "mafia style intimidation techniques."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 positions at NASA, targeting mostly senior-level employees with specialized and management skills. According to documents, the cuts are part of a broader push to reduce the size of the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. This move has caused concern within the space industry, as it would deprive the agency of decades of institutional experience. The planned layoffs come alongside proposed budget cuts that former NASA officials warn could cede U.S. leadership in space.</p>

This push for a deal comes as President Trump continues to announce new tariff threats, including levies on copper, pharmaceuticals, and goods from multiple countries. EU officials hope to reach a satisfactory conclusion before the U.S. deadline of August 1. The administration's widening trade war has created significant uncertainty in the global economy, prompting key partners to seek negotiated solutions. (not investment advice)</p>
