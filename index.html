          <p>Facing increasing tariffs from the United States, Chinese e-commerce companies like Alibaba are strategizing to support their sellers by exploring markets beyond America. Alibaba is providing resources and training to help businesses navigate customs procedures and expand domestically. Despite concerns about tariffs, many business owners remain determined, with some planning to pass costs to consumers or shift focus to Europe. This adaptation reflects China's broader economic shift towards prioritizing international online sales and resilience in response to trade pressures, as entrepreneurs seek new opportunities in a competitive global market.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that without serious action against global warming, extracurricular outdoor sports in Japan may become impossible during summer by the 2060s. Heat stress projections indicate that intense sporting activity should be avoided in most regions during peak afternoon hours in July and August. The study highlights the potential impact of climate change on daily life, prompting considerations for adapting future school activities to mitigate the effects of rising temperatures.</p>
