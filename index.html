        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlocked decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling that taxpayer-funded religious charter schools violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The unsigned ruling affirms the lower court's decision, preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first religious charter school financed by taxpayer money. The court's action leaves in place lower court rulings that said the arrangement would have violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment. This case highlights the ongoing debate over the separation of church and state in education, particularly regarding the use of public funds for religious institutions.</p>

          <p>Airlines are struggling to meet the high demand for summer travel due to delivery delays from Boeing and Airbus, leading to a shortage of commercial jets. EasyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis noted that bookings for the third and fourth quarters are ahead of last year, indicating strong demand. Despite reporting a pre-tax loss for the first half of the year, EasyJet anticipates meeting full-year profit expectations. This capacity issue poses a challenge for the industry as it navigates peak travel season, potentially impacting flight availability and prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Trump asserted that there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa, a claim that Ramaphosa and South African courts have refuted. Trump's allegations, echoed by Elon Musk, suggest that white South Africans are fleeing the country due to violence and racist laws. A South African court ruled claims of white genocide as unfounded and "clearly imagined," though murders of farmers, regardless of race, remain a problem in the country. The White House released a statement supporting Trump's claims, citing articles from conservative media outlets, and has fast-tracked Afrikaner refugees' applications for resettlement in the U.S.</p>

The company, which uses software to provide remote musculoskeletal injury treatment and post-surgery rehabilitation, will trade on the NYSE under the ticker "HNGE." While its IPO valuation is significantly lower than its 2021 private market valuation, Hinge Health's successful IPO is a positive sign for the struggling digital health sector. The company's first-quarter revenue increased significantly, and it reported a net income swing from a loss last year to a profit this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 from the current $10,000. This provision, part of President Trump's tax package, phases out over $500,000 and goes into effect in 2025, with annual 1% increases from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially offsetting the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The proposal faces potential challenges in the Senate, as the previous unlimited SALT deduction was limited by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.</p>

          <p>The recently passed tax bill features 'Trump Accounts,' a new savings initiative aimed at providing a tax-advantaged way to save for children's futures. Similar to 529 college savings plans, these accounts allow earnings to grow tax-deferred, with qualified withdrawals taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While custodial brokerage accounts (UTMA/UGMA) also allow parents to transfer assets to minors, Trump Accounts avoid the 'kiddie tax' on investment income. Experts recommend comparing Trump Accounts with 529 plans, especially for higher education savings, as 529 plans offer federal tax-free growth and have higher contribution limits, while also offering the flexibility to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's previous suggestion to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, the Republican-backed legislation approved by the House does not include this provision due to reconciliation process limitations. Instead, the bill proposes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers aged 65 and older, available to both itemizers and those taking the standard deduction. This 'enhanced deduction for seniors' is effective from 2025 to 2029 and has an income threshold, phasing out for single filers earning over $75,000 and married couples earning over $150,000. Experts warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security could negatively impact the long-term outlook of the program.</p>

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick criticized the plans as a 'get out of jail free card for dangerous criminals'. The review also called for short custodial sentences to be used only in exceptional circumstances, and for courts to have greater flexibility to impose fines or bans.</p>

Republicans defend the bill by stating it puts an end to waste, fraud, and abuse currently in the Medicaid system.

According to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey, most respondents are not seeing a restart in holiday orders, and retailers are still contending with high import taxes. The Port of Los Angeles anticipates a slight uptick in cargo bookings but does not foresee a container surge similar to the pandemic. Consumers can expect fewer product selections and potentially higher prices, as retailers remain uncertain about the future of trade policies.</p>

Inventory jumped 9% month to month, resulting in a 4.4-month supply, the highest level in five years, which is starting to cool prices.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to revoke Biden-era rules on AI chip access does not signify a relaxation of restrictions on China's technological advancement, according to analysts. Instead, it represents a more targeted approach focusing on restricting the use of advanced Chinese chips and limiting the use of US chips to train AI models in China. This shift is viewed as an existential challenge to China's development goals and could potentially introduce greater uncertainties into ongoing trade talks between the two countries. The US Bureau of Industry and Security has issued advisories declaring that the use of Chinese chips violates US export-control rules, sparking protest and warnings from China.</p>

          <p>Gold has historically been a stable store of value, especially during inflation, making it attractive for seniors seeking to protect their retirement savings. While gold prices have surged in 2024 and 2025, seniors should consider their investment goals and risk tolerance before investing. Experts suggest that gold is best used as a portfolio diversifier to reduce risk rather than to aggressively grow value. Alternative investment options include fractional gold investing and gold ETFs, which offer lower-cost entry points. Investors should carefully weigh the pros and cons and seek professional advice before making any decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty-five Maine residents have initiated a 40-day hunger strike to protest Israel's blockade of Gaza and the escalating humanitarian crisis. The Maine Coalition for Palestine is calling for the resumption of unfettered humanitarian aid to Gaza and an end to US arms sales to Israel. Participants are limiting their caloric intake to match that of Gazans under the blockade or observing a Ramadan-style fast. The action is part of a national wave of hunger strikes on US campuses and by organizations like Veterans for Peace, demanding an end to the blockade and US support for Israel.</p>
