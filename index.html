            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under further scrutiny after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat where he shared details of an imminent strike on Houthis in Yemen with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. This revelation follows previous concerns about Hegseth's use of the Signal app and potential leaks of sensitive military information. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the app to determine compliance with DoD policies, while former officials express concerns about the risks of sharing such information over unapproved channels. Hegseth's tenure at the Pentagon is increasingly unstable, with mass firings and leaks contributing to a chaotic environment. Optimism score: 20</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, a decision influenced by the country's robust macroeconomic data and the need to stabilize the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The steady rates come as China reported better-than-expected GDP growth and retail sales figures. This move allows the PBOC to focus on currency stability rather than easing monetary policy. Investors will be closely watching upcoming economic data for April to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on China's economy. Optimism score: 75</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas Walmart in 2019, is expected to accept a plea deal in state court to avoid the death penalty. Crusius, who targeted Hispanics in the attack, has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level. The plea deal in state court would result in a life sentence with no possibility of parole. The decision to pursue a plea deal was influenced by the wishes of the majority of the victims' relatives.

            <p>Rookie golfer Ingrid Lindblad secured her first LPGA victory at the JM Eagle LA Championship, held at El Caballero Country Club. Lindblad, who transitioned from figure skating, relied on her ability to perform under pressure. The victory was secured after fellow rookie Akie Iwai missed a crucial putt on the final hole. Lindblad's win comes with a prize of $562,500, which she joked would be used to upgrade to first class. Optimism score: 95</p>
            <p>95/100</p>
