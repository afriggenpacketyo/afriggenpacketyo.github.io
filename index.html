        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Significant tax changes for inherited IRAs are set to take effect in 2025, potentially imposing a 25% IRS penalty for non-spouse heirs who fail to take required minimum distributions (RMDs). Under the "10-year rule," most beneficiaries must deplete inherited accounts within a decade, with annual RMDs now mandated if the original owner reached RMD age before death. Financial experts advise early planning and strategic withdrawals to navigate these complex regulations and avoid substantial tax hits, especially as wealth transfers to adult children. This article outlines crucial steps to ensure compliance and minimize financial risk (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Police have initiated a manhunt for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford despite being jailed last month for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. Kebatu, who arrived in the UK via a small boat, was meant to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly furious over the error, and a Prison Service officer has been removed from duties pending an investigation into the incident. Public protection remains the top priority as authorities work urgently to return the offender to custody and prevent further risk.</p>

          <p>Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is advocating for the permanent abolition of daylight saving time (DST) in the EU by 2026, arguing that the twice-annual clock change no longer saves energy and negatively impacts health. This move revives a debate the European Commission has pursued since 2018, when a survey showed 85% of Europeans opposed DST. Despite broad popular sentiment, a lack of unanimity among member states on whether to adopt permanent summer or winter time has stalled previous efforts. The Commission is now undertaking further analysis to support future decision-making on this divisive issue.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty in a federal courtroom in Norfolk, Virginia, to charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a 2020 home purchase. James, who successfully prosecuted a civil fraud case against former President Trump, asserts that the charges are a "weaponization" of the justice system for revenge. The indictment alleges she falsely described the property as a second home to secure a lower mortgage rate, using it instead as an investment rental. A trial date has been set for January 26, with James released on personal recognizance.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are experiencing significant volatility, with recent crashes and rebounds reflecting a tug-of-war between various market dynamics. Factors like Federal Rate cut expectations, a weaker dollar, and a resilient stock market are influencing gold's price, alongside persistent inflation which recently hit 3%. Historically, gold acts as an inflation hedge and safe haven, but its relationship with inflation is complex, also depending on central bank decisions and global demand. Investors should consider gold as a diversification tool within a balanced portfolio, rather than a sole safeguard against inflation (not investment advice).</p>

This move comes as a federal judge in Maryland considers releasing Abrego Garcia from immigration custody amidst legal challenges. He was previously mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite having legal status protecting him from persecution by gangs, and later indicted on human smuggling charges upon his return to the U.S. Abrego Garcia's attorney condemns the administration's actions as punitive and unconstitutional, advocating for his removal to Costa Rica, which has offered refugee status.</p>

The inability of French authorities to prevent or quickly solve the theft is highlighted as evidence of this societal surrender.
