          <h2>China Responds to US Tariffs, Calls for Consultation</h2>

          <p>Following the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S., China's Foreign Ministry stated that "the market has spoken," referencing the sharp decline in U.S. stock markets. A spokesperson for the ministry condemned the trade war initiated by the U.S. as unjustified and called for resolving trade differences through equal consultation. This comes after China announced a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S., escalating investor fears of inflationary and recessionary risks to global economic growth. This action signals a continued hardening of positions between the two economic superpowers. </p>

          <p>President Trump's 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries, including the UK, has taken effect, marking a significant shift in global trade. The move has shaken global stock markets, resulting in a record two-day decline for S&P 500 companies. Other countries are preparing retaliatory measures, potentially leading to an all-out trade war. This is a major trade action that will likely evolve as countries negotiate for lower rates, significantly altering the way the US trades with the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that the Trump administration's environmental deregulation efforts, including repealing clean air and water protections, will negatively impact Americans' health and finances. The rollbacks could lead to a significant increase in premature deaths and asthma attacks, costing the public more than they save regulated industries. These changes include weakening standards for pollutants and cutting funding for climate programs, reversing progress made on environmental protection and disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color. These actions are framed as boosting the economy but are projected to result in substantial harm.</p>

          <p>A ban on flying Pride flags over U.S. embassies, initially implemented to secure votes for a spending package, continues to draw criticism for its exclusionary message. With millions of LGBTQ+ refugees worldwide facing persecution, the ban signals a shift away from the U.S.'s traditional role as a welcoming nation. The decision has prompted comparisons to countries like Russia, where LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly restricted, leading some individuals to seek refuge elsewhere. This policy decision raises questions about America's commitment to inclusivity and human rights on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles' Measure ULA, a transfer tax on high-value property sales, is facing criticism for its negative impacts on the city's housing market and economy. Research indicates that high-value property sales have declined significantly since its implementation, leading to reduced revenue and slower housing production. The tax, which applies to properties over $5 million, is based on sale price rather than profit, creating disincentives for sales and hindering property tax growth. Reform options include restricting the tax to single-family homes or adopting marginal rates to eliminate cliff effects.</p>

After a federal law passed in April 2024 mandating that the app be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban, creators have been on an emotional rollercoaster. The fatigue is exacerbated by the constant shifts in the app's status and the broader political context, leaving creators feeling used as a 'political football'. Experts suggest coping mechanisms include finding support groups and stepping away from the platform to alleviate stress.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports could significantly impact Apple and other tech companies with global supply chains. The tariffs are expected to drive up the cost of consumer electronics, potentially increasing the price of an iPhone by as much as $2,500. While Trump aims to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., shifting production is complex and costly, and it may not be feasible in the short term.

          <p>An opinion piece accuses the Trump administration of gaslighting the nation, citing instances of denying objective truth and manipulating information. The article draws parallels to the film *Gaslight*, where a character manipulates his wife into questioning her sanity. The piece argues that the administration's disinformation campaign aims to provoke distrust and undermine civil society's ability to mobilize. It calls for truth-tellers to speak up and for citizens to insist on seeing the world as it actually is.</p>

          <p>President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies are leading to a decline in foreign tourism to the United States. Countries are updating their travel advisories to warn citizens about potential difficulties entering the U.S. This decline is a result of Trump's strategy of disrupting trade relationships and disrespecting other countries. The United States is now perceived as a less welcoming destination, impacting tourism and the economy.</p>

          <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacteria found in the large intestine, may help prevent obesity and maintain gut health. This bacteria feeds on mucin, a mucus layer in the large intestine, and helps maintain the gut barrier. Research has found that people with metabolic diseases have fewer Akkermansia muciniphila in their gut. Eating a high-fiber diet can help maintain the balance of this bacteria and promote a healthy gut microbiome.</p>
