          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations and increased its revenue and profit forecast for the year, attributed to cost-cutting measures and strong performance from newer drug brands. The updated guidance factors in the impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China but does not account for potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. The company is actively pursuing its "China 2030 Strategy" to expand its presence in the Chinese market and include more Chinese patients in clinical trials. Despite a recent setback with its schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, Bristol Myers Squibb is relying on its growth portfolio to offset revenue losses from treatments losing market exclusivity. </p>

          <p>Comcast reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, despite a decline in broadband subscribers due to increasing competition from alternative internet options. The company's mobile business continues to be a strong point, with a significant increase in revenue and subscriber additions. Comcast experienced cable TV customer losses, but growth in Peacock, its streaming platform, helped offset declines in other areas. Revenue for Peacock was up 16% and the streamer's quarterly loss narrowed significantly compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has been conducting airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen since March 15, in an operation known as “Operation Rough Rider,” in response to the group's attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. The strikes have targeted command and control facilities, weapons manufacturing sites, and storage locations, resulting in casualties and infrastructure damage. While the administration claims success in weakening the Houthis, analysts suggest that air strikes alone will not defeat the group, which has survived years of similar campaigns. The conflict raises concerns about the U.S. becoming further entangled in Middle Eastern conflicts and shifting resources away from other priorities.</p>

This revised outlook does not account for potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Merck is investing significantly in U.S. manufacturing and research and development to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs.

          <p>A debate has arisen among Democrats regarding the party's focus on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant deported to El Salvador, with some strategists fearing it could politically benefit President Trump. While some Democrats advocate for Abrego Garcia's due process rights, others worry that prioritizing immigration could detract from economic concerns. The argument centers on whether high-profile advocacy for the undocumented is a net positive or negative for the party, considering voters' approval of Trump's immigration policies.</p>

The author argues that attempts to recreate a romanticized past, rather than embrace the reality of a changing world, result in costly mistakes and hinder economic progress.
