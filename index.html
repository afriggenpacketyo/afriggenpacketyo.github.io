          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeted the fourth floor of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people, among them four journalists. Health officials reported a "double-tap" strike, with a second missile hitting as rescue teams arrived. The Israel Defense Forces stated they would conduct an inquiry and regretted harm to uninvolved individuals, denying targeting journalists. This incident adds to mounting pressure on Israel regarding journalist casualties in Gaza, as international organizations demand explanations and independent access.</p>

His attorney stated that ICE officers provided no reason for the detention nor information about his destination. This detention occurred shortly after Garcia rejected a plea deal that would have deported him to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea to human smuggling charges.

          <p>Nvidia is approaching its fiscal second-quarter earnings report, marking two years since the generative AI boom began transforming its business. The chipmaker has seen its revenue more than triple and profits quadruple, becoming a $4 trillion market cap company. However, revenue growth has slowed from triple-digits to an anticipated 53%, with data center revenue now comprising 88% of total sales. Analysts are closely watching Nvidia's Blackwell line performance and its re-negotiated access to the Chinese market for the H20 chip, as these factors will heavily influence the broader AI market's perception.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced its intent to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's for approximately $18 billion, a move aimed at bolstering its struggling U.S. coffee business. The deal, which offers a 33% premium to JDE Peet's shareholders, is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies. Following the acquisition, anticipated in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies. This strategic restructuring seeks to enhance market appeal and address declining single-serve coffee pod sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The American Rescue Plan Act, which made loan forgiveness tax-free federally, expires at the end of 2025.

          <p>President Donald Trump was seen with a new bruise on his left hand, following a persistent one on his right hand earlier this year. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the marks to Trump's frequent hand-shaking as a "man of the people." This explanation mirrors a previous response, though the White House later provided a medical reason for the earlier bruise, citing soft-tissue irritation and aspirin use. The latest discoloration, observed in a golf video, continues to fuel public speculation regarding the President's health.</p>

While companies are reassessing travel procedures, the report suggests the general risk of exit bans or detentions for American travelers remains unchanged.
