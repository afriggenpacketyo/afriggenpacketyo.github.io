          <p>FanDuel Sports Network, formerly Bally Sports, has announced a doubling of paid subscribers to nearly 650,000 in eight weeks and anticipates reaching one million direct-to-consumer customers by year-end. This growth follows Main Street Sports Group's emergence from bankruptcy and strategic partnerships with Amazon's Prime Video, SB Nation, and Yahoo Sports. The streaming platform averages 250,000 unique daily users and one million unique monthly users since the start of the 2025 MLB season. The network is testing lower price points, though current pricing starts at $19.99 a month, to attract more subscribers amidst the challenges of pay-TV subscriber losses in the regional sports network business model.</p>

          <p>Farmers in western Iowa are facing increased economic pressures due to high costs, low crop prices, and the escalating trade war with China, which has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The tariffs are adding to existing challenges such as a dry spring and high interest rates on loans, leading to concerns reminiscent of the 1980s farm crisis. Farmers are tightening their belts, delaying equipment purchases, and restructuring loans, while local banks are urging them to seek additional income sources. Despite the hardships, many farmers express hope that President Trump will provide financial assistance if needed.</p>

The indictment alleges a pattern of abuse toward women, including manipulation into commercial sex acts, assaults, and control through money, drugs, and threats.

          <h2>Social Security Reduces Overpayment Clawbacks to 50% After Beneficiary Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 16:36:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration is reducing its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% after concerns that the initial rate caused financial hardship for beneficiaries. The agency had previously increased the clawback rate from 10% to 100% to safeguard taxpayer funds, following directives from Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. While the reduction to 50% is a step in the right direction, advocates argue that it will still be a burden for many low-income beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services, including Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros.

The move has created uncertainty within the industry, with questions swirling about how the duties would be implemented and which productions would be affected. Experts worry about the potential impact on relationships with other countries and the industry's reliance on international box office sales. The duties could also impact the relationships with other countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismantled some of the tents erected at GuantÃ¡namo Bay to house migrants, just three months after the operation began. The camp, intended to house up to 30,000 migrants, never expanded beyond 32 detainees, and no migrant surge ever occurred. The operation, criticized as a waste of taxpayer funds, has cost $40 million, including $3 million for unused tents. The military says it can expand migrant operations at GuantÃ¡namo if needed, but the decision to dismantle tents indicates a shift away from housing tens of thousands of migrants on the base.</p>
