          <p>A 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck offshore from a southern Philippine province, triggering concerns about a potential tsunami. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology anticipates damage and aftershocks due to the shallow depth of the earthquake's origin. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned of possible hazardous waves within a 300-kilometer radius of the epicenter, including potential waves up to 3 meters above normal tides on some Philippine coasts. Smaller waves could also impact Indonesia and Palau, prompting authorities to monitor the situation and advise coastal communities to take necessary precautions. The event underscores the region's vulnerability to seismic activity and the importance of early warning systems. </p>

          <p>Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger engaged in a heated gubernatorial debate, marked by Earle-Sears' aggressive questioning and Spanberger's attempts to maintain a bipartisan stance. A central point of contention was Spanberger's reluctance to directly condemn Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones after the emergence of violent text messages. Earle-Sears repeatedly pressed Spanberger on the issue, accusing her of lacking courage, while Spanberger focused on denouncing political violence generally. The debate also covered topics such as the federal shutdown and transgender rights, highlighting the stark differences between the candidates' approaches to governance and social issues. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in a dramatic National League Division Series game, propelled by a crucial throwing error from Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering. With the score tied and the bases loaded in the 11th inning, Kerkering's miscue allowed the Dodgers to score the winning run, securing their place in the National League Championship Series. The game was a tense, low-scoring affair featuring strong pitching performances from both sides, but ultimately decided by a late-inning blunder. The Dodgers now advance to face either the Milwaukee Brewers or Chicago Cubs for a chance to compete in the World Series. </p>

After obtaining boarding passes and clearing security, their flight reservations were abruptly canceled at the gate. Bray, who has faced death threats and online harassment following the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, believes the incident may be related to his research and public profile. He and his family were rebooked on a later flight, but the reason for the initial cancellation remains unclear, raising concerns about potential political interference. </p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, who previously led a civil fraud investigation against Donald Trump, has been criminally indicted on federal charges of bank fraud. Prosecutors allege that James made false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia. James has accused President Trump of weaponizing the justice system for political retribution, while the assigned U.S. prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, asserts that no one is above the law. The case has sparked controversy, with accusations of political motivation and concerns about the independence of the Justice Department. </p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, siding with state and local leaders who opposed the Trump administration's plan. The judge cited a lack of credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois and questioned the reliability of the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the situation. The ruling prevents National Guard units from operating in Illinois for 14 days, including protecting federal agents and facilities. The decision has been praised by Illinois officials who view it as a victory for states' rights and a check on presidential power. </p>

          <p>The new "Tron: Ares" movie uses its end and mid-credits scenes to set up potential future storylines, linking the film to both the original "Tron" and "Tron: Legacy". The mid-credits scene shows Julian Dillinger, grandson of the original villain Ed Dillinger, embracing his digital identity, hinting at his return as a villain reminiscent of Sark. The film ends by showing Ares looking at images of Quorra from "Tron: Legacy," suggesting a possible future connection between the two characters. These scenes leave the door open for the franchise to explore new narratives and connect with established lore. </p>

          <h2>LAFD Did Not Use Thermal Imaging After Jan. 1 Fire</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles firefighters did not utilize thermal imaging technology to detect lingering embers after a New Year's Day fire in Pacific Palisades, which later reignited and became a destructive inferno. Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva stated that the technology was not used due to the fire's 8-acre size, despite its ability to pinpoint underground heat. Critics have questioned this decision, arguing that thermal imaging is a standard protocol for preventing rekindle fires. The Palisades fire resulted in significant damage and casualties, raising concerns about the LAFD's fire management practices. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has outlawed the practice of declawing cats, deeming it inhumane and outdated. Assembly Bill 867 prohibits veterinarians from performing the procedure, which involves amputating the first bone in each of a cat's toes or severing its tendons. The law allows declawing only in cases of medical necessity, such as recurring infections or conditions jeopardizing the animal's health. Animal advocates and lawmakers have praised the ban as a significant step towards protecting animal welfare, while the California Veterinary Medical Assn. opposed the bill, arguing it limits the scope of veterinary practice. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that a reasonable listener would not interpret Lamar's criticisms of Drake, including claims of inappropriate behavior, as objective facts. Drake had alleged that UMG endangered his life by releasing a song that depicted him as a pedophile and promoted violent retribution. UMG has expressed satisfaction with the dismissal, while Drake's spokesperson stated that the rapper plans to appeal the decision. </p>

          <p>California has enacted new laws to restrict puppy sales and enhance protections for buyers, addressing deceptive practices by out-of-state commercial breeders.

These measures aim to increase transparency and combat fraudulent pet breeding and selling practices. </p>

The number of fires in trash bins, garbage trucks, and waste-collection facilities has surged, largely due to the "vape effect." These fires pose a significant threat to waste-disposal workers, interfere with recycling efforts, and release harmful chemicals into the environment. Authorities are urging vape users to dispose of their used devices at specialized facilities and are launching public awareness campaigns to promote safe battery disposal. </p>

The White House defended the deployments, asserting the president's legal authority. The lawsuits challenge the constitutionality of using military forces on civilian streets, with state lawyers arguing that protests do not meet the standard required for military intervention. </p>

          <p>Spending time outdoors can trigger measurable changes inside your body, from lowering stress hormones to easing blood pressure and even improving your gut health. Studies show that just 20 minutes in nature can have a significant impact, with maximum benefits occurring after that amount of time. Being outdoors can trigger relaxation, lower cortisol and adrenaline levels, and improve the body's hormonal system. The scent of trees and soil can also have a calming effect, and exposure to good bacteria in soil and plants can boost the microbiome. </p>
