          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and injuries to over 30 people, including five firefighters. Responders arrived to find heavy flames and people needing rescue from windows, with the fire chief describing it as an "unfathomable tragedy." The cause of the five-alarm fire is under investigation. The chief also emphasized the immense mental health toll on first responders and families, highlighting that nobody is programmed to deal with such a traumatic event.</p>

          <p>An independent inquiry into the BBC show 'MasterChef' has substantiated 45 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace, spanning a 19-year period. The upheld claims include inappropriate sexual language, culturally insensitive comments, and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. The report notes that Wallace was recently diagnosed with autism, which may help explain some actions, but he does not wish to hide behind it. In response to the findings, the BBC has apologized for missed opportunities to address the behavior sooner and has no plans to work with Wallace in the future.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is renewing its push for nuclear powers to sign the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (SEANWFZ). The 1995 treaty aims to keep the region free of nuclear weapons while allowing for civilian nuclear energy. Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to signing without reservation, and Russia has also indicated it will join. This diplomatic effort occurs as the U.S. and China vie for influence, with Beijing seeking to portray itself as a responsible stakeholder in the region.</p>

          <p>A military dog named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero in Colombia for saving dozens of lives by detecting a bomb planted by guerrilla fighters. The device exploded during the operation, and Sanson lost a leg in the blast but survived after surgery. The army stated the dog's actions protected 36 soldiers and hundreds of civilians who use the path where the bomb was located, though he will no longer be able to serve.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's surprise threat to impose 30% tariffs on the EU, European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to devise a coordinated response. While some leaders are calling for the preparation of strong countermeasures, the bloc has temporarily suspended its own retaliatory tariffs to allow for last-minute negotiations before the August 1 deadline. The situation has created significant uncertainty for the massive trade relationship between the U.S. and the EU, which is worth trillions of dollars annually.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, named the Dragon Bravo Fire, has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other buildings on the park's North Rim. The blaze, ignited by lightning, has consumed thousands of acres and forced the closure of the North Rim for the remainder of the season. In response to the devastation, Arizona's governor has called for a comprehensive and independent federal investigation into the fire's management and the decision-making that led to the loss.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered thousands of instances of abuse involving the use of restraints on federal prisoners. The investigation found that officials violated their own rules, shackling inmates for extended periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a form of punishment. The report, which details cases leading to death and amputation, calls for clearer policies and more robust oversight to prevent such abuses and ensure humane treatment.</p>

The author connects the tragedy to reckless cuts in funding for science, preparedness, and infrastructure, which leave children especially vulnerable to climate-fueled disasters. The piece makes an urgent call for reinstating funding for early warning systems and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure to protect communities.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation rate fell to 2.10% in June, an unexpectedly low figure that marks its eighth consecutive monthly decline and a more than six-year low. The easing inflation, driven primarily by falling food prices, provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue relaxing its monetary policy and potentially cut interest rates further. A strong harvest and good monsoon season are expected to keep food inflation low, supporting overall economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
