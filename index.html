          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, faced a second consecutive night of unrest as rioters threw fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs at police. The violence, which police described as "racist thuggery," followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault case involving two teenage boys who appeared in court. The clashes resulted in property damage, including arson and smashed windows, with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationalities. Politicians have expressed concern over the escalating tensions, fearing potential fatalities, while also acknowledging the underlying issues of illegal immigration and demographic changes in the area.</p>

          <p>Asian countries are increasingly moving away from reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties and the dollar's potential use as leverage in trade negotiations. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is promoting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while the BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems. Investors are also hedging their U.S. dollar exposures, increasing demand for local currencies. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, its share in global foreign exchange reserves has been declining, signaling a gradual shift towards de-dollarization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend testified about his alleged behavior, including drug use and sexual fantasies, during his federal trial for sex crimes. While experts acknowledge the compelling nature of the testimony, they question its relevance to the specific charges Diddy faces. The case hinges on whether the alleged actions were coercive or consensual. The defense is portraying Diddy as a drug addict to garner sympathy from the jury. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>
