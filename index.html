          <p>A panga-style fishing boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, California, leading to the deaths of three people and leaving seven others missing. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that at least 16 people, including two children, were on board the vessel. The incident is being investigated as a suspected case of human smuggling, with Indian passports found near the site where the boat washed ashore. Four survivors have been hospitalized, and the search continues for those still missing. This incident underscores the dangers associated with illegal maritime crossings. Optimism score: 5</p>

          <p>Britain and India have finalized a trade agreement aimed at bolstering economic ties between the two nations. The deal, expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, involves India reducing tariffs on 90% of goods, with most becoming tariff-free within a decade; duties on British whiskey and gin will be halved, and car tariffs will be significantly reduced. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a new era for trade and the economy, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as ambitious and mutually beneficial.

          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey indicates that respondents believe the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year and next due to a stagflationary outlook. The survey, which included fund managers, analysts, and economists, forecasts the fed funds rate declining to 3.71% by year-end and 3.36% by the end of 2026. The odds of a recession in the next year have risen to 53%, while the consumer price index is expected to increase to 3.2% by year-end before declining next year.
