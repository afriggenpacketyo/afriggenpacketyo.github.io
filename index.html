Israeli sources indicate they have only agreed to a framework, not a final deal, while Hamas continues to demand a complete end to the war and withdrawal of forces. The diplomatic uncertainty persists amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, where hundreds of civilians have been killed in recent weeks while trying to access desperately needed aid.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban. The liberal-majority court ruled that the 1849 law was superseded by a 1985 statute that permits abortions until a fetus is viable outside the womb. This ruling solidifies the legality of abortion in Wisconsin, resolving legal uncertainty that has persisted since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

          <p>A significant increase in U.S. job cuts in 2025 has led to widespread layoff anxiety, with nearly half of Americans concerned about their job security. Experts note this fear is creating a vicious cycle where employees overwork to prove their value, leading to faster burnout and negatively impacting their well-being. To regain a sense of control, specialists advise creating an action plan, having honest conversations with supervisors, and proactively updating resumes and professional networks.</p>

The job losses, primarily seen in professional services and health and education, suggest a potential cooling in the labor market, driven by a hesitancy to hire and replace departing workers.
