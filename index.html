            <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods, while intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., is unlikely to achieve this goal. According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, manufacturers are exploring relocation to other countries like Egypt and Indonesia instead. The Cambodian government is considering fiscal policies to mitigate the tariff's impact, as factories face an existential crisis. Moody's suggests companies will likely pause executive decisions on supply chain investments due to the uncertainty caused by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is scaling back its enforcement of cryptocurrency regulations, disbanding the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET). A memo from the Deputy Attorney General instructs federal prosecutors to avoid targeting virtual currency exchanges and mixing services for end-user actions. This shift aligns with President Trump's pro-crypto stance, focusing instead on individuals who defraud investors or use digital assets for criminal activities. The memo criticizes the previous administration's approach and suggests a change in handling cases like Tornado Cash and Sam Bankman-Fried's prosecution.</p>

U.S. crude oil saw a slight increase to $60.94 per barrel, while Brent crude rose to $64.39 per barrel. China has vowed to retaliate against the tariffs, and President Trump has threatened additional levies if China proceeds with its countermeasures.

            <p>President Trump has dismissed critics of his sweeping tariffs as 'PANICANS,' urging Americans to trust his policies. The term 'PANICAN' is believed to be a combination of 'panic' and either 'Americans' or 'Republicans'. Influential voices within the Republican Party, along with Democrats and foreign leaders, have criticized Trump's trade policies. Trump claims his tariffs will bring jobs and manufacturing to the U.S., while critics warn of economic consequences.</p>

            <p>The Green Party of England and Wales is aiming for a record number of councillors in the upcoming local elections, seeking to build on its recent successes. Party co-leader Adrian Ramsey stated the party aims to increase its power base for an eighth election in a row. The party is seeking to win over voters disillusioned with mainstream politics, offering a positive change. The Greens have failed to match the recent polling successes of Reform UK, but emphasize their track record of delivering results on councils.</p>

Talks between bin workers and the city council have ended without an agreement, and are due to resume on Tuesday.

            <p>President Trump announced that the US and Iran will hold direct talks over a possible new nuclear deal on Saturday. Iran's foreign minister said the talks in Oman would be "indirect" but could be "as much an opportunity as... a test". Trump, who pulled the US out of a 2015 nuclear deal, said discussions would be at a "very high level" and that Iran would be in "great danger" if talks were not successful. Hours later, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said "indirect high-level talks" would take place on Saturday in Oman.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences announced it used genetic engineering to breed dire wolf puppies, claiming to have "de-extincted" the species. However, experts say the puppies are genetically modified grey wolves, not actual dire wolves. Ancient dire wolf DNA is too degraded to copy or clone. Instead, the team used synthetic biology technology, snipping out pieces of DNA and inserting them into the genetic code of a living grey wolf, resulting in a hybrid.</p>

            <p>Overseas shares and U.S. futures advanced Tuesday, led by gains in Tokyo where the Nikkei 225 shot up just over 6% as markets calmed somewhat after the shocks from President Trump 's tariff hikes. The modest rebound for most markets followed a wild day on Wall Street, where stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher. Early Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said it would "fight to the end" and take unspecified countermeasures against the United States after Mr. Trump threatened another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.
