          <p>A major manhunt is underway in Paris for four suspects who stole "priceless" French crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in a daring daylight robbery. The thieves used a truck with a mobile ladder to access a second-floor gallery, smashed display cases, and escaped on motorbikes with nine pieces of historic jewelry in about seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the theft as an attack on national heritage, vowing to recover the items, which include pieces once belonging to Empress Eugenie and Napoleon's wife, Marie-Louise. The museum remained closed as a large-scale investigation involving around 60 detectives commenced.</p>

          <p>Following a contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly suggested that Ukraine should cede the Donbas region to Russia to end the war. Reports indicate the White House discussion turned into a "shouting match," with Trump allegedly warning that Russia would "destroy" Ukraine if it did not accept the terms. Trump also declined Zelenskyy's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, signaling a potential shift in U.S. policy that appears more aligned with Russian interests. The U.S. president is now planning a summit with Vladimir Putin in Hungary, further unsettling Ukrainian officials.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday caused widespread disruptions across the internet, affecting major websites and online services globally. Companies including Disney+, Reddit, Snapchat, and various banking and airline apps reported problems as a result of an "operational issue" in a key AWS data center. While AWS reported that the issue was mitigated and services were recovering, the event highlighted the fragility of global technology infrastructure. Cybersecurity experts noted the incident appeared to be a technical fault rather than a cyberattack, underscoring the need for businesses to build greater resilience and multi-cloud strategies.</p>

U.S. envoys are traveling to the region to help restore the agreement. Meanwhile, in the United States, the federal government shutdown has entered its 20th day with no resolution in sight, as Democrats and the Trump administration remain deadlocked over funding and healthcare subsidies. The article also highlights escalating U.S.-Colombia tensions after President Trump ordered attacks on suspected drug boats.</p>

          <p>The Afghanistan women's refugee football team is facing heartbreak and uncertainty after their entry visas to the United Arab Emirates were repeatedly rejected, preventing them from playing in a FIFA-organized tournament. The matches would have been their first since fleeing the Taliban, who have brutally oppressed women's sports. The players, most of whom are now based in Australia, feel a sense of "abandonment, trauma and disillusionment" as FIFA has remained silent on the issue. Speculation suggests the visa denials may be politically motivated, as the UAE is one of the few nations to officially recognize the Taliban government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump strongly condemned Virginia's Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, calling him an "animal" for past text messages that wished death upon a political opponent. Speaking to reporters, Trump asserted that anyone else would be "put in prison" for such comments. The controversy stems from 2022 texts where Jones imagined shooting a Republican legislative leader, whose children he also referred to as "fascists." While Jones has since apologized for the messages, he has retained endorsements from prominent Democrats, drawing further criticism from Republican groups who accuse his supporters of downplaying political violence.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called "V-levels" for 16-year-olds in England, intended to replace Level 3 BTECs and other technical courses. The initiative aims to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-16 education options, providing a clearer vocational path alongside traditional A-levels and newer T-levels. Additionally, a new "stepping stone" qualification will be introduced to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting GCSEs in maths and English.

          <p>Los Angeles city officials have declared eight properties in Pacific Palisades, including a burned-down mansion famously featured in the HBO show "Succession," to be public nuisances. The designation comes after the owners allegedly failed to clear hazardous ash and debris following a recent fire, posing a potential risk to public health and safety. The city's vote pressures the owners to expedite cleanup or face having the city hire contractors to do the work and bill them for the cost. The property owners cited various reasons for the delays, including high costs and disputes over insurance payouts.</p>

          <p>An unoccupied California Highway Patrol cruiser was damaged by shrapnel after a Marine Corps artillery round detonated prematurely during a live-fire demonstration over Interstate 5 at Camp Pendleton. The incident occurred after California officials, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, had expressed grave safety concerns and briefly closed a 17-mile stretch of the freeway for the event. The demonstration, part of a celebration of the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, was terminated early after the explosion. This event has intensified scrutiny over the decision to fire live munitions over a major public highway, which the CHP described as "highly uncommon."</p>

          <p>The AUKUS security pact, a multi-billion dollar deal for the U.S. and U.K. to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, is currently under review by the Trump administration to ensure it aligns with its "America First" agenda. The review has raised concerns in Australia and the U.K. that the landmark defense project could be jeopardized. The deal's first pillar involves Australia purchasing U.S. Virginia-class submarines, while the second focuses on collaboration in advanced military technologies like AI and hypersonic missiles. Despite the review, Australian and British officials have downplayed the fears, describing it as a normal process.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to hire Sean Dyche as its new manager, following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Dyche, formerly the manager of Everton and Burnley, has emerged as the leading candidate to take over the struggling club, which currently sits in the relegation zone. The move would mark another change for Forest this season, as Postecoglou himself was only appointed in September after the club sacked Nuno Espirito Santo just three matches into the campaign. The club hopes to finalize a deal quickly.</p>

          <p>In her posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre recounts fearing she might "die a sex slave" and details extensive abuse within Epstein's circle. The book, obtained by the BBC before its official release, alleges she had sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, starting when she was seventeen. One of these encounters was described as an "orgy" on Epstein's private island with other underage girls. Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Giuffre in 2022, has consistently denied all allegations of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident at Hong Kong International Airport resulted in the deaths of two ground security staff after an Emirates cargo plane veered off the runway upon landing. The Boeing 747, arriving from Dubai, crashed through a perimeter fence and collided with the security patrol vehicle, pushing it into the sea. The four crew members aboard the aircraft survived the crash, which left the plane partially submerged and broken in half. An investigation is now underway to determine the cause of the incident, which is one of the deadliest at the airport in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a notable shift of emphasis, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has directly attributed long-term damage to the British economy to the 2020 Brexit deal. Speaking at an International Monetary Fund committee, Reeves cited the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast that leaving the EU would result in a 4% long-term reduction in productivity. This acknowledgment signals a change in the government's public messaging and is expected to be a key argument in the lead-up to the next Budget. The statement confirms that the economic consequences of Brexit are a significant factor in the UK's current financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
