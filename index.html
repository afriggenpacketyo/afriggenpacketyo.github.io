          <p>Young South Korean voters who previously participated in demonstrations following President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law are now expressing disappointment with their choices in the recent election. These voters, who were once actively engaged in political discourse and protest, feel let down by the available candidates and the overall political landscape. The disenchantment among young voters highlights a broader challenge for South Korean politicians in addressing the concerns and aspirations of this demographic, who are crucial for shaping the country's future. Their disillusionment underscores the need for candidates to offer more compelling and relevant platforms to regain their trust and engagement. </p>

          <p>Trading has resumed on the Damascus Securities Exchange after a six-month closure, signaling a move towards economic recovery in Syria following nearly 14 years of civil war. The stock exchange had been closed during the turbulent period leading up to the ouster of former President Bashar Assad. Syrian Finance Minister Mohammed Yisr Barnieh stated that the reopening indicates the country's economy is beginning to recover, with the stock exchange operating as a private company focused on digital development. This move coincides with the easing of international restrictions on Syria's financial systems and a recent $7 billion power deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and U.S. companies to revitalize the electricity grid. </p>

          <p>The UK government has announced an additional Â£2 billion investment in drones and plans to adopt weapons and tactics from the war in Ukraine to enhance its military readiness. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that the British Army will expand for the first time in a generation, with submarines being a key focus of the Strategic Defence Review. Meanwhile, German police have launched a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, 18 years after her disappearance.

          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone this month to bolster its naval defenses amid growing pressure from mainland China. The drone, developed under the 'Kuai Chi Project,' will undergo combat capability evaluations before further tests later this year. The defense ministry has allocated over NT$800 million for the project, with plans to begin mass production in 2026, aiming to acquire over 200 vessels to support coastal assault operations. Equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, the attack vessel will autonomously lock onto and strike enemy ships after target assignment, enhancing Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy. </p>

          <p>In a recent election, Poland has signaled a potential shift back towards populism with the narrow victory of Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian, over Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw. This outcome follows a period where Poland was seen as a beacon of democratic comeback after the election of Prime Minister Donald Tusk in 2023. The election highlights the resilience of populism and the ongoing challenges faced by liberal democracy in maintaining its ground. With Poland sharing a border with Ukraine, the results also carry implications for foreign policy and the country's role in NATO. </p>

          <p>MI5 is under renewed scrutiny after a High Court judge expressed a lack of confidence in the Security Service's account of how a senior officer provided false evidence in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The agent, known as X, allegedly used his MI5 role to coerce and terrorize his girlfriend, even attacking her with a machete. A panel of High Court judges will now consider potential actions, including contempt of court proceedings against MI5 or individual officers. The case revolves around false claims made by MI5 during a legal battle to prevent a BBC investigation into X's conduct. </p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity experienced an unexpected contraction in May, marking its fastest decline since September 2022, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tariffs on export orders. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 48.3, signaling a contraction for the first time since September of the previous year. The decline in foreign demand accelerated, with new export orders reaching their lowest level since July 2023, while the job market remained grim, with employment shrinking for the second consecutive month. These factors have contributed to increased uncertainty in the external trade environment, adding to domestic economic headwinds. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Due to rising tariffs, a restaurant in Beijing has been forced to remove American chicken feet from its menu and substitute Australian beef in its 'Great American' burger. The owner of Kunyuan restaurant laments the loss of the American delicacy, noting its superior quality compared to local alternatives. This situation illustrates the tangible impact of trade policies on businesses and consumers. While alternative sources are available, the owner hopes for a resolution that will allow him to serve American phoenix talons once again. </p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her recent comments regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to constituents' concerns about Republican cuts to Medicaid with the statement, 'Well, we're all going to die,' which Scholten criticized as lacking leadership. Scholten, a former baseball player who has previously run for higher office, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy, highlighting the impact on Iowa soybean farmers. While Iowa's House seats are considered competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008. </p>

          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene has resigned after failing to secure enough support in a confidence vote, triggered by weeks of public protests against allegations of corruption, inequality, and rising living costs. Oyun-Erdene received only 44 votes in the 126-seat parliament, falling short of the 64 needed to remain in office. He will remain in a caretaker role until a successor is appointed within 30 days. The resignation follows reports of lavish spending by Oyun-Erdene's son and a drop in Mongolia's ranking on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index since he assumed power in 2021. </p>
