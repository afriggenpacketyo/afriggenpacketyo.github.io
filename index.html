          <p>The New York Times reports on the increasing anxiety among American Jews following several attacks, including one in Colorado during a march supporting hostages held in Gaza. This has contributed to a growing sense of danger for Jewish individuals simply existing in public. The attack in Colorado, where a man allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a crowd of people who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring 12 victims, heightened concerns about safety and security. This incident, along with others, has made many in the Jewish community feel more vulnerable and targeted. The current climate has made it difficult for many in the Jewish community to feel safe. </p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, passed away at 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing to their nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the team. Known as "Mr. Giants," he was admired for his on-field prowess and charismatic personality, transcending sports. His retirement in 1974 was a major news event, and his words at the ceremony became part of Japan's cultural lexicon. His legacy extends beyond his playing career as he also helped elevate professional baseball's popularity in Japan.</p>

          <p>Two Japanese nationals were murdered in Dalian, China, and a Chinese suspect has been detained, according to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The victims were male, and Chinese authorities informed the Japanese Consulate General in Shenyang that the motive was a business dispute. This incident follows other attacks in China involving Japanese citizens, including a fatal stabbing of a schoolboy and a knife attack at a school bus stop. While a Japanese government source indicated the murder was due to a business grudge and not politically motivated, it raises concerns about the safety of Japanese citizens in China. The authorities are working to determine the exact nature of the business dispute.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are participating in a snap election to select a new president following the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges for imposing martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win due to public frustration with conservatives. The new president will immediately be sworn in for a five-year term and will confront significant challenges, including a slowing economy, President Trump's trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats.

          <p>San Diego elected officials have condemned recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) work raids at two Italian restaurants, where agents used flash-bang grenades against protesting residents. The raids, conducted by Homeland Security Investigations, targeted alleged violations of hiring and harboring undocumented immigrants. City officials criticized the use of excessive force, arguing it undermined trust and created fear within the community.

          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that shielded a Los Angeles police officer from liability in a fatal shooting, potentially impacting future qualified immunity cases. The lawsuit involves LAPD officer Toni McBride, who killed Daniel Hernandez in 2020, with the court citing a precedent that continuing to shoot an incapacitated suspect violates the Fourth Amendment. The case will now proceed to trial in U.S. District Court, with the Hernandez family's lawyer stating that this means justice has been served.

The hoax garnered significant media attention and was initially believed by officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. However, the claim unraveled when it was revealed that Morales-Reyes could not read or write in either Spanish or English.

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides relief for older borrowers who rely on fixed incomes and may struggle to afford basic necessities if their benefits are reduced. The government has significant collection powers on student loans, including the ability to seize tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits. The administration's move aims to protect vulnerable Social Security recipients who are in default on their student loan debt. (not investment advice)</p>
