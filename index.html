        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Royal College of Nursing is anticipated to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, which the union has labeled as inadequate compared to other public sector awards. This rejection, following a consultative vote with high turnout, could lead to a formal strike ballot in the autumn if the government does not engage in new negotiations over the summer. The move comes as other health unions, like the GMB, also reject the offer, and resident doctors begin a five-day strike, increasing pressure on the National Health Service.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. medical groups, including the American Medical Association, are voicing deep concern over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This panel of independent experts provides crucial, evidence-based guidelines for preventive care, such as cancer screenings and managing chronic diseases, which have been a trusted resource for doctors for 40 years. The potential move follows the recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee with less-qualified picks, raising fears of political interference that could erode trust in medical guidance and impact insurance coverage under the ACA.</p>

The deal is set to run until the end of 2033, though details regarding the counterparty are being kept confidential at their request to protect trade secrets. This long-term agreement is a significant development for Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies and has been working to catch up to competitors in the market for advanced AI-related memory chips.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service took an individual into custody after they climbed a fence at the U.S. Treasury Building, located next to the White House. The suspect dropped a bag, which prompted a response from an explosive ordnance disposal team that ultimately cleared the item as safe. The individual was hospitalized for evaluation and will face charges for unlawful entry and a fugitive from justice warrant. The incident occurs amid heightened security concerns, following two assassination attempts on President Trump during his 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>A tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity projects a dramatic reconfiguration of global trade in response to the new U.S.-EU deal. The model forecasts a more than 46% drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent averages, with countries like China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases. Conversely, the analysis suggests that countries will rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., with China expected to significantly increase imports from nations like Russia and Vietnam. This shift highlights how the new 15% tariff framework could make many products more expensive, potentially reducing product diversity for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

This applies to scenarios like projects stalling due to technical hurdles or market changes rendering a product unviable.

          <p>Japan's political landscape, long known for its stability, is experiencing a significant shift with the rise of the far-right Sanseito party, which recently increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen. The party's "Japanese First" slogan, echoing Donald Trump's rhetoric, resonates with a populace frustrated by inflation, stagnant wages, and a sluggish economy. This discontent is compounded by anxieties over rising immigration and tourism, which the party frames as a threat to public order and a drain on resources. Analysts suggest this populist surge challenges the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party and signals a new, more volatile era in Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, ending months of tense negotiations and heading off a potentially damaging trade war. Announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the deal establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, half the rate Trump had threatened. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to spending tens of billions more on U.S. energy and investing heavily in the U.S., a move both sides hailed as a stabilizing development for the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>An animal welfare charity is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid concerns over imported pets. Thousands of dogs are brought in annually from countries like Romania and Ukraine, often with minimal vetting, leading to issues with infectious diseases and aggressive behavior. The RSPCA describes the process as a "Deliveroo for dogs" and warns of a growing number of cases of Brucella canis, a disease transmissible to humans. The investigation highlights the pressure placed on UK shelters that must deal with the fallout when owners are unable to cope with these often traumatized animals.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter and be distributed. The move is intended to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address a severe hunger crisis, with food experts warning of famine. While aid trucks have begun to enter, UN officials and world leaders state that while the pause is welcome, a broader ceasefire is essential to alleviate the catastrophic suffering of the Palestinian population. The pause occurs as Israel's offensive continues in other parts of the territory.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to properly warn millions of people before the catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey in 2023, which killed over 55,000 people. The system severely underestimated the quake's strength, sending only 469 high-level "Take Action" alerts instead of the 10 million it could have, which would have provided up to 35 seconds of warning. Researchers cited limitations in the detection algorithms at the time, which have since been improved, but the revelation has drawn criticism for the lack of transparency following the disaster.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the brilliant mathematician and musical satirist whose witty and acerbic songs targeted politics, the nuclear age, and societal norms, has died at the age of 97. Rising to fame in the 1950s and 60s, Lehrer's clever, piano-driven compositions became underground sensations and later reached a wider audience on the TV show "That Was The Week That Was." Despite his popularity, he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his career as a math professor. He is remembered as a pioneering figure who established a genre of smart, subversive comedy songwriting.</p>

          <p>The Keeladi excavation site in India's Tamil Nadu state has unearthed artifacts suggesting a literate, urban civilization existed there as early as 580 BCE, challenging narratives about the origins of civilization in the subcontinent. The findings have ignited a political and historical debate, fueling Tamil pride and intensifying the cultural divide between India's north and south. State archaeologists claim the evidence points to a southern civilization as ancient as those in the north, but the transfer of the lead archaeologist and disputes over his report have led to accusations that the federal government is suppressing Tamil history.</p>

Organizations like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, which uses DNA to find babies stolen by the regime, have had their crucial government subsidies cut off, sparking protests and fears that the country's memory and pursuit of justice are under threat.</p>

          <p>A remarkable investigation led by an Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." During the 1970s, political prisoners were drugged and thrown from the plane into the Atlantic Ocean. By finding the plane in the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs, the investigators uncovered irrefutable evidence of these atrocities, including the specific flight that killed a group of activist mothers and two French nuns. This evidence was crucial in a historic trial that convicted the pilots and has brought the plane back to Argentina as a chilling witness to state terrorism.</p>

Piastri secured the win by making a brave move at the start and carefully managing his medium-compound tires under pressure. Norris, who started on pole, may reflect on small errors, including a mistake at the first corner and a less optimal pit strategy, that cost him a chance to challenge for the lead. The race underscored how strategy, execution, and nerve are defining the close intra-team battle at McLaren this season.</p>
