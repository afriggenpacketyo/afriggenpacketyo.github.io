        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, the country's first significant standalone cryptocurrency bill, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation received strong bipartisan support and is now headed to the president for his signature. Proponents believe stablecoins, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, will revolutionize global commerce by enabling instant, low-fee money transfers. However, critics argue the regulations are too lenient and were heavily influenced by over $100 million in lobbying from the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Netflix announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $11.08 billion. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy member growth, increased ad sales, and a weaker U.S. dollar. This marks the second quarter Netflix has not released specific subscriber data, instead focusing on metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the strong results, shares dipped slightly due to a warning of higher content and marketing costs in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following medical tests prompted by mild swelling in his lower legs. Officials described the condition, which involves inadequate blood flow in leg veins, as benign and common for individuals over 70. The administration also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use. A memo from the White House physician affirmed that there was no evidence of more serious conditions and that the president remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>Mark Johnson, a former HSBC trader jailed in the United States, has had his wire fraud conviction fully overturned after a nine-year legal battle. He was convicted in 2017 for allegedly manipulating exchange rates by 'front-running' a large trade, a practice his defense successfully argued was a normal industry risk management technique known as 'pre-hedging'. The full acquittal was granted by a U.S. appeal court after a law used in his prosecution was overturned, with his lawyer stating the case should never have been brought.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan national, previously convicted of felony sexual assault and deported twice, was arrested by ICE after being released by Arlington County, Virginia. The county's sanctuary policy prevented local authorities from honoring a federal detainer, forcing ICE agents to track the individual in the community. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons criticized the policy, stating it endangers both the public and law enforcement by releasing criminals back onto the streets instead of allowing for a secure transfer in custody.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is rescinding $4 billion in federal funds for California's high-speed rail project, declaring there is no viable path forward for its development. The Department of Transportation cited missed deadlines, significant budget shortfalls, and the state's failure to secure an additional $7 billion needed for the initial segment. The project, which aims to connect San Francisco to Los Angeles, has seen its projected cost balloon from an initial $33 billion to as high as $128 billion.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has been abruptly fired by the Department of Justice. The termination is widely seen as politically motivated by President Trump's long-standing animosity toward her father. Comey was a key prosecutor in several high-profile cases, including those against Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs, and her firing has raised concerns about the politicization of the justice system and potential intimidation of career prosecutors.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act, which would unlock federal FEMA funding for affected communities. The proposal follows a deadly June heat dome that broke temperature records, but for which no disaster was declared because heat is not explicitly listed in the act. If passed, the bill would allow states to request federal aid for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects like planting more trees.</p>

          <p>Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the party pending an investigation into her recent comments about racism. In a BBC interview, she reiterated controversial views from 2023, suggesting that prejudice against Jewish and Traveller people is not the same as racism based on skin color because they are not always visibly identifiable as a minority. The comments drew immediate criticism from across the political spectrum, leading to her suspension and forcing her to sit as an independent MP.</p>

The man, who reportedly has no criminal record and was in the process of applying for a green card, was stopped by agents who then followed him to the school. The incident, which involved officers breaking the man's car window, is the first confirmed federal immigration arrest at an Oregon school since the Trump administration overturned a policy that had restricted enforcement at such sensitive locations.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria, officially justified as necessary to protect the Druze minority, are viewed by analysts as part of a broader strategy to maintain a weak Syrian state and carve out an informal buffer zone in the south. Experts suggest Israel is exploiting internal Syrian unrest to escalate its military campaign, aiming to prevent the new government from becoming a regional threat. This policy of force, while potentially serving Israeli security interests, risks further destabilizing the fragile country and undermining regional peace efforts.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police is planning to close half of its public-facing front counters at police stations to save money, reducing the number from 37 to just 19 across the city. The move breaks a previous pledge to maintain a 24/7 counter in every London borough and comes as the force faces a significant budget shortfall. The Met defended the closures as a "tough choice" needed to focus resources on tackling crime, noting that only 5% of crimes are currently reported at these counters.</p>
