          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of regulating the exercise of power as a crucial measure in the fight against corruption. Speaking at an event, he called for an improved institutional mechanism to unify the authorization, use, and control of power, making it transparent and traceable. Xi urged party members to remember that all power is granted by the people and must be used responsibly. This statement comes as millions of Chinese officials participate in an education campaign focused on implementing Xi's austerity rules to improve the party's conduct and public image.</p>

          <p>An agreement between Republican senators to restrict states from passing new artificial intelligence regulations has been removed from a major legislative package backed by President Trump. The collapsed deal would have required states to pause new AI laws for five years in exchange for federal infrastructure funding. Senator Marsha Blackburn withdrew her support, arguing the provision would allow Big Tech to continue exploiting children and conservatives without sufficient federal protections in place. The move highlights a growing rift among Republicans over the balance between federal preemption and states' rights in governing emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon series of votes on President Trump's major tax and spending bill, titled the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," as Republicans aim to pass it before a July 4 deadline. The legislation, which includes increased spending on border security and defense offset by cuts to social programs, is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" procedure to force votes on controversial amendments, while Republican leadership works to secure support from holdouts. The bill's passage remains uncertain as it faces opposition over its spending cuts and fiscal impact.</p>

          <p>Some major financial institutions are expressing support for President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," suggesting it could provide a necessary boost to the U.S. economy. Proponents, like those at Nomura and Citi, argue the bill would prevent a sharp fiscal contraction by extending expiring tax cuts and could stimulate business investment. However, other experts and institutions, including Morgan Stanley and the Tax Foundation, raise serious concerns about its fiscal irresponsibility, projecting it will add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit. Critics also point to poorly designed tax cuts and increased administrative burdens on the IRS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Iowa law has taken effect, making it the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, thereby eliminating non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary residents in housing, employment, and public life. The law also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents individuals from changing the sex on their birth certificates. Governor Kim Reynolds stated the law acknowledges "obvious biological differences," while critics, including Iowa's first openly transgender lawmaker, fear it will lead to increased hostility and discrimination. The move is part of a broader trend of restrictions on transgender rights in Republican-led states.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit a new, remote immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, a site the White House has highlighted for its isolation and surrounding wildlife. Dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by some, the facility is located 50 miles west of Miami and is intended to house up to 5,000 detainees. The administration hopes its inhospitable location, surrounded by alligators and unforgiving terrain, will serve as a deterrent. Critics, including immigrant activists and some Native American leaders, have condemned the facility as a cruel political stunt that also threatens a delicate ecosystem.</p>

To compound the loss, City's key midfielder Rodri, recently returned from a knee injury, suffered a setback and was forced off during the match, raising concerns for the upcoming season.</p>

While the deal ensures a conviction and avoids a lengthy trial and appeals process, the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves expressed frustration, stating they were not adequately consulted.

These films explore the brutal realities of French slavery and its psychological aftermath, moving beyond sanitized historical accounts.

          <p>Analysts are forecasting that China's yuan will continue to strengthen against the U.S. dollar, following its strongest daily reference rate since last November. In June, the onshore yuan gained 0.41% against the dollar, driven by resilient macroeconomic data that has eased bearish sentiment on China's growth outlook. According to Goldman Sachs, this trend is also fueled by growing investor concerns over the sustainability of U.S. government debt and loose fiscal policies. The investment bank predicts the yuan will appreciate further, potentially breaking the 7-per-dollar mark within six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have arrested four employees of the satirical magazine LeMan for publishing a cartoon that officials claim depicts the Prophet Muhammad. The editor-in-chief, graphic designer, cartoonist, and an institutional director were detained after the interior minister condemned the drawing as "shameless." LeMan magazine has denied that the cartoon refers to the Prophet, stating it was intended to portray the righteousness of oppressed Muslims. The arrests have sparked protests and drawn criticism, with the magazine's management expressing worry over similarities to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in France.</p>

          <p>A private survey has revealed that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June, despite trade disruptions. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely supported by an expansion in production. This contrasts with the official PMI report, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage. Despite the positive headline figure, new export orders declined and employment in the sector remained weak amid cautious hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly the tightening of eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) disability benefit. Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is engaged in a major persuasion effort to quell dissent from dozens of backbench Labour MPs. Critics within the party argue the changes are contrary to Labour values and that a planned review will conclude too late to influence the new criteria. The leadership maintains the reforms are essential for the long-term stability of the welfare state.</p>
