          <p>The White House strongly defended President Trump's new tariffs despite significant market declines and international backlash.  Press Secretary Leavitt urged trust in Trump's economic plan, while Vice President Vance acknowledged the "big change" but emphasized the need for it.  Economists predict increased costs for consumers, a point neither official directly addressed. Global leaders are considering retaliatory measures.</p>
