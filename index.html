          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles III, at Buckingham Palace during a recent visit to the United Kingdom, marking their first private meeting in over a year. The encounter, described as a tea, took place amidst ongoing treatment for the King's cancer and continued strain within the royal family. While Harry commented that his father was "doing great," his relationship with his brother, Prince William, remains non-existent, with the two not having spoken in person since 2022. Harry's trip focused on charity events, though his security concerns in the UK persist.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. The single shot, believed to have been fired from the roof of a nearby building, struck Kirk in the neck in front of a crowd of approximately 3,000 people. Authorities have launched a massive manhunt for the suspect, describing the incident as an assassination and an active investigation. The killing has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from President Trump, who was a close ally of Kirk.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot at age 31, was a prominent conservative activist and a key ally of President Donald Trump. He co-founded the student organization Turning Point USA at 18, which grew into a major force in mobilizing young conservative voters through campus events and a significant social media presence. Kirk was known for his provocative rhetoric on cultural issues and his staunch support for the MAGA movement, which earned him both a large following and significant criticism. His death has been described by supporters as a major loss for the American conservative movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that a law preventing husbands from taking their wives' surnames is unconstitutional, citing gender-based discrimination. The landmark decision came after two couples challenged the existing Births and Deaths Registration Act, arguing it was archaic and patriarchal. The court's ruling, which was not opposed by the government, affirms a lower court's decision and requires Parliament to amend the legislation. Proponents of the change argued that the old law perpetuated harmful stereotypes by denying men a choice that is available to women.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature has connected more than 200 severe global heat waves to the greenhouse gas emissions of major fossil fuel and cement companies. The research found that the pollution from these "carbon majors," including firms like ExxonMobil and BP, made these deadly weather events substantially more likely and intense. Some of the heat waves, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, would have been "virtually impossible" without these corporate emissions. This growing field of attribution science could have significant implications for climate litigation against these companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant increase in fall-related deaths among older adults in the U.S. over the past three decades may be linked to the rising use of certain prescription drugs. A category of medications known as fall risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs), which includes opioids, benzodiazepines, and some antidepressants, can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired balance. Public health experts argue that the surge in these prescriptions correlates with the spike in fatal falls. While physicians caution against stopping necessary medications, they recommend reviewing prescriptions to minimize risks and help seniors maintain their safety and independence.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has approved a major infrastructure project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. The initiative, estimated to cost around 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), aims to ease traffic congestion at the critical shipping hub. The plan involves constructing a new double-line, five-stage lock system and is described as the largest integrated project on the river since the original dam's construction. This move is part of a broader push by Beijing to drive economic growth through strategic investment in large-scale infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

These couples rely on a combination of antiretroviral drugs, preventative pills (PrEP), and condoms to manage the virus and prevent transmission. However, the reduction in U.S. funding has led to shortages of these essential supplies, with clinics rationing medications and condom dispensers often empty.

The charges primarily relate to the period when the club was owned by Roman Abramovich and involve potential violations of rules on agents and third-party investments in players. The club's new ownership, led by Todd Boehly, discovered the "potentially incomplete financial reporting" during their due diligence process and self-reported the issues to regulators.

          <p>This opinion article frames the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a tragic manifestation of rising political violence that affects all sides of the political spectrum. The author notes that while many prominent progressives expressed sympathy, some figures on the right immediately called for retribution, further inflaming tensions. The piece argues that America has already become a country that confronts political disagreements with violence, citing past attacks on political figures as examples. It concludes that the nation's deep partisan divisions and the normalization of violent rhetoric prevent meaningful change or accountability.</p>

          <p>Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee is facing backlash for his swift condemnation of Charlie Kirk's killing, with critics pointing to his different response to a shooting involving Democratic lawmakers months prior. After the June shooting of Minnesota lawmakers, Lee amplified misinformation suggesting the attacker was a "Marxist," posts he later deleted. Following Kirk's death, Lee praised him as an "American patriot" and denounced the "cowardly act of violence." Critics on social media highlighted the contrast, questioning his consistency and accusing him of politicizing tragedies based on the victims' affiliations.</p>

          <p>This column argues that Democrats, who typically oppose government shutdowns, should be prepared to force one to counter the Trump administration's agenda. With government funding expiring on September 30, the author suggests that Senate Democrats should use their leverage to demand negotiations on key issues, such as restoring healthcare funding and extending tax credits. If Republicans refuse to compromise, the piece contends that Democrats should vote against funding the government. A temporary shutdown is presented as a worthwhile tactic to fight against an administration seen as undermining government functions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration, despite campaigning on ending "forever wars," has started two new ones: a military-led war on drugs in the Caribbean and a symbolic war on crime in American cities. The author contends that deploying significant naval assets to interdict a single speedboat and using National Guard troops for policing are inefficient and costly distractions. These actions are seen as degrading military readiness at a time when the U.S. should be focusing on the strategic threat posed by China. The article concludes that these new "wars" are unwinnable and misuse military resources.</p>

During his confinement, he became a symbol for a movement demanding his freedom, and he alleges he was beaten and sexually assaulted by guards.

          <p>The California Legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit public colleges and universities from disciplining students who seek emergency medical help during a drug overdose. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, aims to remove the fear of academic probation or expulsion, which can deter students from calling 911. Advocates argue that this "Good Samaritan" protection is crucial for saving lives, especially amid the ongoing opioid crisis. The bill requires schools to offer rehabilitation options instead of punishment and mandates that students who receive emergency assistance complete a treatment program.</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal by California Governor Gavin Newsom to fast-track the construction of a controversial 45-mile water tunnel under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta has stalled for the year. The plan aimed to streamline environmental reviews and authorize bond sales for the estimated $20.1 billion project. Supporters argue the tunnel is crucial for modernizing the state's water infrastructure against climate change, while opponents, including environmental groups and local lawmakers, contend it would devastate the Delta's ecosystem and harm native fish populations. The failure of the proposal marks a significant setback for a key priority of the Newsom administration.</p>

          <p>California legislative leaders have introduced a last-minute compromise bill aimed at addressing concerns over potential gas price hikes from refinery closures. The deal, brokered by Governor Gavin Newsom, would streamline the approval process for up to 2,000 new oil wells per year in Kern County to increase in-state production. In a concession to environmental advocates, the bill would also make future offshore drilling more difficult by imposing stricter safety and regulatory requirements on pipelines. The proposal attempts to balance the state's economic needs with its climate goals, but has drawn criticism from both sides.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the technology to observationally confirm a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By analyzing the waves from a collision of two black holes, researchers verified Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. The analysis showed that the new, merged black hole had a larger surface area than the sum of the two original black holes. This achievement was made possible by significant upgrades to the LIGO detectors, allowing for much clearer signals.</p>

Experts suggest the current climate, marked by intense economic anxiety, deep political polarization, and dehumanizing rhetoric from leaders, is comparable to fraught periods like 1968. The article explores how a sense of "democratic despair" can lead individuals to believe violence is the only solution. While leaders from both parties condemned the killing, the immediate reactions online highlighted the entrenched divisions that fuel such acts.</p>
