          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 08:52:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including 11 awards of £100,000, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom. Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), has not done enough to trace winners, particularly those with older, non-digitized bonds. While NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes since 1957, consumer advocates and legal experts are calling for reforms to simplify the tracing process for heirs and those who have lost their original paperwork, especially amid the current cost of living crisis. The issue highlights difficulties in accessing older savings and the need for better systems to reunite people with their money.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a contentious town hall meeting where he was repeatedly heckled by constituents over his support for a major policy and tax bill signed by President Trump. The audience expressed anger regarding the bill's impact on healthcare, particularly Medicaid, and tax provisions, with chants of "Tax the Rich!" interrupting the congressman. Flood defended the legislation as a middle-class tax cut and argued its healthcare changes were aimed at able-bodied adults who refuse to work. The event concluded with the crowd shouting "vote him out," reflecting significant public discontent with the policies discussed.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has formally submitted a bid for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, with the total financial package potentially reaching €85 million (approximately £73.8 million). The offer includes a guaranteed payment of €75 million (£65.2 million). The club is awaiting a response from RB Leipzig but is reportedly confident in its valuation and believes the Slovenian international is eager for a move to Old Trafford. This move highlights Manchester United's intent to strengthen its attacking options, though they face competition from Newcastle, who have also made an unsuccessful bid for the player.</p>

          <p>A year after a student-led uprising in Bangladesh led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the families of those killed by security forces are still demanding justice. The protests, which resulted in as many as 1,400 deaths, have left a lasting scar on the nation, with families like that of 24-year-old Abu Sayed, who was shot by police, grappling with their loss. While an interim government was established, there is a growing sense of disillusionment as it struggles to address mob violence, unemployment, and protect minority groups. The slow pace of the tribunal investigating the protest deaths highlights the ongoing challenges in achieving accountability and reform.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit forecast for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and a strong performance in the second quarter. The pharmaceutical giant reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, an increase from its previous guidance. This optimistic outlook comes as the company navigates potential impacts from U.S. drug pricing policies and tariffs, reflecting confidence in its strategic execution and financial resilience.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his search for the next Federal Reserve chair has been narrowed to four individuals, confirming that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer a candidate. Trump stated that Bessent expressed a desire to remain in his current role. The announcement follows the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a new member to the central bank's board. Among the likely contenders are former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, both of whom have supported lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The aftermath of Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, has left thousands of homes in Scotland without electricity. Utility company SSEN reported that while power has been restored to 50,000 homes, approximately 22,000, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire, were still disconnected as of Tuesday morning. The storm brought gusts up to 90mph, causing widespread disruption, including over 100 incidents on rail lines due to fallen trees. Officials anticipate that while most customers will be reconnected soon, some complex repairs may extend into Thursday.</p>

          <p>Independent MP and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has publicly criticized his former colleague, Communities Secretary Angela Rayner, for authorizing the sale of eight community allotments since the recent general election. Allotments, small plots of land rented for growing produce, are legally protected from development without ministerial approval. Corbyn, an avid allotmenteer, argued that selling these "precious spaces" is a mistake, especially when social housing could be built on ex-industrial land instead. The sales, which include sites slated for new housing, have reignited debate over the protection of green spaces versus the need for new development in the UK.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County grand jury has chosen not to indict former Atlanta police officer Kiran Kimbrough on manslaughter and other charges related to the 2023 death of 62-year-old church deacon Johnny Hollman Sr. Hollman died after being tased and restrained during a struggle with the officer that began when he refused to sign a traffic citation after a minor car crash. Body camera footage showed Hollman repeatedly saying, "I can't breathe." Hollman's family expressed devastation at the decision, stating the justice system failed them, while the officer's attorney claimed Hollman's death was caused by medical issues and his resistance to a lawful arrest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent political debate has focused on whether UK police should disclose the nationality of crime suspects, but the existing rules are complex and allow for discretion. Legally, police must avoid releasing information that could prejudice a fair trial. Official guidance from the College of Policing, updated after the Leveson inquiry, specifies what can be released at arrest and charge stages but does not explicitly mention nationality or immigration status. This leaves the decision to individual forces, who must balance transparency and preventing misinformation with legal obligations, as seen in differing approaches in recent high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly set to propose a full military reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet. According to Israeli media, a senior official stated the goal is the "full conquest of the Gaza Strip" and the defeat of Hamas, suggesting military leaders who disagree should resign. This potential move is met with strong opposition from the families of hostages, who fear for their loved ones' safety, and many of Israel's international allies who are pushing for a ceasefire. The proposal comes after ceasefire talks broke down and as international pressure mounts for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>BP's chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has announced that the company will conduct a thorough review of its oil and gas assets to "maximise shareholder value."

The announcement coincides with BP revealing its largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years, located off the coast of Brazil. The company's focus on monetizing its fossil fuel production comes after posting better-than-expected profits for the second quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, largely due to struggling sales in the U.S. for its Pizza Hut and KFC chains. Both brands saw a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales, facing stiff competition and reduced consumer spending on dining out. While the company's international business showed some strength, the domestic weakness was significant. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to be a bright spot, posting a 4% growth in same-store sales both domestically and internationally, demonstrating its resilience in the current market.

By leaving, the Democrats have temporarily halted the plan, escalating a partisan battle over voting rights and representation.

          <p>NASA is reportedly fast-tracking its plans to develop and place a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, a key step toward establishing a permanent human lunar base. The move is seen as a response to similar ambitions from China and Russia and is aimed at securing a reliable power source for long-term missions, as solar power is not viable during the two-week lunar night. While scientists agree nuclear power is likely necessary for a lunar settlement, the ambitious timeline is questioned amid recent NASA budget cuts.

The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by families who argue the law violates the constitutional separation of church and state. While the judge assailed the law as part of a "coordinated strategy... to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms," his decision currently only applies to the districts involved in the suit. The legal battle is part of a wider push in several Republican-led states to increase religion's presence in schools.</p>

This trend is seen by some as a revival of a blog-era literary culture, providing a space for discussion and discovery as traditional book media declines.

Economists note that while GDP growth appeared strong in the second quarter, the underlying data points to weaker consumer spending and business investment, partly due to tariff pressures.
