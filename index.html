          <p>President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, ranging from 10% to 49%, sent shockwaves through the stock market. Apple led the decline, falling over 6% in after-hours trading, followed by other tech giants like Nvidia and Tesla.  The tariffs, described by Trump as a move towards economic independence, target imported goods, significantly impacting companies heavily reliant on foreign manufacturing. This could mark the steepest decline for Apple since September 2020.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs mark a radical shift in US trade policy, reversing decades of free trade and globalization.  The broad and high tariffs are expected to have significant consequences for the US economy, increasing inflation and potentially triggering retaliatory measures from other countries.  The impact on global trade and geopolitical relations remains uncertain, but a period of significant economic instability is anticipated.  The move is seen as a response to the perceived negative consequences of free trade and globalization.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer's diplomatic approach towards Trump's tariffs seems to have yielded some positive results, with the UK facing a lower tariff than the EU.  The 10% tariff is still negative for the UK economy, but the lower rate compared to other countries suggests Starmer's strategy of negotiation and engagement may be effective.  The UK is working towards a bilateral economic agreement with the US, aiming to mitigate the impact of tariffs.  The success of this strategy will depend on the speed of securing this agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced two new tariff types on "Liberation Day": a 10% universal import duty and reciprocal tariffs targeting 60 countries.  The reciprocal tariffs aim to equalize trade imbalances by charging countries half the tariff they impose on US goods.  The tariffs will go into effect in early April.  Economists predict the tariffs will increase inflation and consumer costs, despite Trump's claims of revitalizing the US industrial base.</p>
