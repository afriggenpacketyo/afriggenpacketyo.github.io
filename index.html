          <p>A passenger train derailed in western Russia after a bridge collapsed onto the railway tracks, resulting in at least seven fatalities. Emergency services responded to the scene to search for individuals who were traveling on the train and to provide assistance to the injured. Hours later, another bridge collapsed in the Kursk region, involving a freight train, with the train catching fire and the driver sustaining injuries. The Moscow Railway alleges the first bridge collapse was due to "illegal interference in transport operations", although investigations are underway to determine the exact cause of both incidents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that while parents in Europe find greater meaning in life compared to childfree individuals, they often experience lower life satisfaction, particularly mothers. The study highlights that family policy measures, such as childcare and parental leave, play a significant role in parental satisfaction, with Scandinavian countries showing less disparity between parents and non-parents. Gender equality and supportive business cultures also contribute to higher satisfaction levels among parents, as family responsibilities are more evenly distributed. The research suggests that children should be viewed as a societal responsibility rather than solely a parental one, which can be achieved through comprehensive family policies.</p>

This decision has forced players like Billie Sky to stop playing competitively, although she can still play informally with a non-FA-affiliated club.

          <p>The UK's strategic defense review will outline significant new investments in national security and send a strong message to hostile states, according to Defence Secretary John Healey. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" from Russia and other countries, including China. The government announced it will spend Â£1.5 billion on new defense factories, creating 1,800 jobs, and will procure up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The investment aims to strengthen the armed forces and boost British jobs amid concerns about depleted stockpiles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's approach to China, characterized by a mix of aggression and weakness, increases the likelihood of war with Taiwan. Trump's trade policies and hostility towards China, combined with his perceived cowardice in foreign policy, may embolden Xi Jinping to take action against Taiwan. The author suggests that Trump's actions are driven by self-interest and fear, rather than principles or alliances, making Taiwan a vulnerable target. The analysis highlights the potential for miscalculation and escalation in the US-China relationship under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>A palliative care physician, Sunita Puri, reflects on the importance of living authentically and fully, especially when facing mortality. Drawing from patient experiences and popular culture, she emphasizes that confronting death often leads to a deeper appreciation of ordinary life rather than outlandish bucket lists. Puri highlights that people often seek to reconcile the differences between the life they have and the one they longed for, focusing on meaningful connections and personal goals. The essay underscores the significance of living with an awareness of death to embrace life more freely.</p>

          <p>Despite potential impacts on medal prospects, skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit, restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. World Skate instituted the limit due to increasing injuries among younger athletes attempting complex tricks. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the decision, citing the risk of children lacking the necessary skills or physical maturity. While some Japanese organizers will keep domestic competitions open to younger athletes, the focus remains on supporting the development of future stars.</p>
