          <h2>UK School Meal Portions and Meat Content Reduced Due to Rising Costs, Caterers Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:08:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School food caterers in the United Kingdom are being forced to reduce portion sizes, use less meat, and opt for cheaper ingredients in student lunches due to escalating costs. The chair of LACA, a school food organization, stated that government funding is failing to keep pace with the actual expense of providing meals, which is estimated to be around £3.45, significantly higher than the £2.61 allocated per meal. This funding gap forces difficult decisions that compromise the nutritional quality of food for children, many of whom rely on school lunches as their only hot meal of the day. The situation is worsening as an expansion of free school meal eligibility will reduce income from paying parents.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham has released a new Netflix series, "Too Much," which draws inspiration from her own experiences moving to London as an American. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, follows a New York workaholic navigating life and love in the UK, contrasting romanticized fantasies with the city's reality. Dunham explains that the series explores the cultural and social challenges of adapting to a new country, even one that shares the same language. The 10-episode romcom is notable for its extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Andrew Scott, Stephen Fry, and Jennifer Saunders, who Dunham credits as a major comedic influence.</p>

          <h2>China's Producer Prices See Largest Decline in Nearly Two Years, Deepening Deflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 00:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) dropped by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant fall in almost two years and exceeding economists' forecasts. This extended deflationary trend reflects a deepening price war among companies as they contend with weak consumer demand and excess inventory. While the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight 0.1% increase, returning to growth, concerns about persistent overcapacity remain. Policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting and pledged to tighten regulations to stabilize the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>European Intelligence Agencies Warn of Escalating Russian Sabotage Campaign</h2>

          <p>European intelligence officials are increasingly concerned about an escalating campaign of sabotage across the continent, believed to be orchestrated by Russia's intelligence services. These operations, which include arson and planting explosives, are reportedly being carried out by amateur proxies recruited online, increasing the risk of civilian casualties. A recent case in London, where men were convicted of setting fire to a warehouse storing aid for Ukraine, provided a rare look into the recruitment and handling of these operatives. Intelligence sources state that since the expulsion of many Russian spies, Moscow has shifted to using deniable, less predictable proxies, leading to more violent and dangerous incidents.</p>

          <p>China has announced the completion of a significant 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively enclosing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. This project is part of the country's larger "green great wall" initiative aimed at combating desertification and controlling sandstorms. Engineers utilized a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like the sacsaoul tree. This ecological barrier is designed to prevent further desert expansion and protect surrounding areas from the environmental impact of these vast deserts, which cover nearly 95,000 square kilometers.</p>

          <p>An FBI criminal investigation has reportedly been opened into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan. The probe is said to focus on their involvement in the 2016 Russia interference investigation, including allegations of making false statements to Congress. According to sources cited by Fox News Digital, the investigation into Brennan was initiated after a referral from then-CIA Director John Ratcliffe. While details on the Comey investigation are scarce, the development marks a significant turn in the long-running political and legal battles surrounding the controversial Russia probe and the actions of top intelligence officials during the Obama administration.</p>

This decision supports the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has already overseen the departure of some 260,000 federal workers.

Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old head of the Ennahda party, and others faced charges including attempting to overthrow the government and involvement in terrorist activities, which his lawyers dismissed as baseless. Several other figures, including a former foreign minister and Ghannouchi's son, were sentenced in absentia to 35 years.

Despite receiving flood watches from the National Weather Service over 12 hours before the disaster, the camp did not relocate its 650 attendees to higher ground.

          <p>According to hydrologists with the National Weather Service, the deadly flood along Texas's Guadalupe River was a known risk based on historical precedent in the region known as "Flash Flood Alley." Experts recognized the potential for a catastrophic event, leading to a flash flood watch being issued up to 10 hours before the water surged. The area's steep terrain and rocky ground cause rivers to rise with extreme speed, leaving little time for warnings to be effective, especially overnight. Historical records show the river has experienced major, deadly flooding over a dozen times in the last century, highlighting the recurring danger to the increasingly populated area.</p>

Japan's economy is already at risk of a technical recession, and economists predict the new duties could further lower its GDP growth. While President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets, the aggressive tariff policy creates significant headwinds and uncertainty for two of America's most important trading partners in Asia.

          <p>John C. Harris, a prominent figure in California's agriculture and horse-racing industries, has passed away at the age of 81. As the owner of the multifaceted Harris Farms, he oversaw a massive agribusiness but was particularly passionate about the thoroughbred breeding operation, which produced national champions like Tiznow and California Chrome. Harris was a dedicated advocate for the state's agricultural and horse-racing sectors, serving on the boards of several industry associations and working to preserve traditions like live racing at the Big Fresno Fair. Friends and colleagues remember him as a humble, down-to-earth leader who mentored many and left an indelible mark on his industries.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas's Kerr County brings back memories of a similarly devastating flood in 1987 that scarred the same area. That event, which also occurred on the Guadalupe River, killed ten teenagers and injured dozens more when a wall of water overwhelmed campers trying to evacuate. The region, known as "Flash Flood Alley," has a long and deadly history of such events, with water rising rapidly in its narrow riverbanks. The recurrence of these tragedies highlights the persistent danger in the area, where even experienced locals can be caught off guard by the speed and ferocity of the floodwaters.</p>

          <p>China's commerce ministry has imposed an immediate export ban on several Taiwanese companies, including key aerospace and shipbuilding firms, citing national security and non-proliferation obligations. The new rules prohibit the export of dual-use items—materials and technology with both civilian and military applications—to the named entities. Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office described the measure as a "stern warning" to what it calls "separatist forces" in Taiwan. Among the targeted companies is AIDC, a crucial supplier for Taiwan's indigenous defense industry, including its fighter jet development program, escalating economic pressure on the island.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's military intelligence agency, for his role in a scheme that uses fraudulent IT workers to generate revenue for the regime. Song is accused of helping North Korean operatives pose as American remote workers to get hired by foreign companies, with their earnings funneled back to support Kim Jong Un's weapons programs. The scheme involves stealing personal information of U.S. citizens to create aliases for the workers. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt North Korea's attempts to circumvent sanctions through cyber activities.</p>

The local governments filed a motion to intervene in a case brought by the ACLU, arguing that the federal sweeps are instilling fear, disrupting communities, and obstructing local law enforcement. The lawsuit claims federal agents are conducting unlawful detentions without warrants or probable cause. This legal action comes as the administration's crackdown has led to over 1,600 arrests in the region since early June, creating widespread anxiety among residents.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court alleges they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has severely restricted the rights of women to education, movement, and public life. A Taliban spokesman dismissed the warrants as "nonsense." The ICC, which prosecutes the world's worst crimes, relies on member states to enforce its warrants, meaning the leaders could be arrested if they travel to a member country.</p>

Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. The decision caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high and is expected to help domestic producers but hurt the many U.S. firms that rely on the metal as a key input.

          <p>The catastrophic and deadly floods in Texas have intensified scrutiny of the Trump administration's staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. While experts believe the NWS performed its duties well for this specific event, they warn that continued reductions could impair future forecasting and public safety. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, leaving some offices with high vacancy rates for meteorologists and other specialists. Critics argue that running the agency on a "bare bones operation" is dangerous when lives are at stake, especially as extreme weather events become more frequent.</p>
