          <p>A tragic accident occurred in Lisbon when the city's renowned funicular cable railway derailed, resulting in the deaths of at least 17 people and injuring approximately 20 others. Among the victims was a transport worker and foreign nationals from various countries, with a three-year-old German boy sustaining minor injuries. Police are actively investigating the cause of the crash, which has plunged Portugal into a national day of mourning. Eyewitnesses described the carriage careening out of control at high speed before colliding with a building, causing widespread panic and a scene of devastation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Labor Department is set to release its crucial August employment figures, with economists closely watching for signs of stability or further cooling in the labor market. This report follows President Trump's controversial dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after July's disappointing job growth figures and significant downward revisions for prior months. The data will be critical for the Federal Reserve, which is expected to consider its first interest rate cut since December 2024 to support job growth. Experts anticipate a modest gain of around 80,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate potentially holding steady at 4.2%.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its anti-drug-trafficking operations in the Caribbean, deploying multiple warships and announcing a deadly strike on a vessel allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela. President Trump claimed the strike killed 11 "narcoterrorists" and accused Venezuela of being a source of drugs and criminals. Analysts suggest these actions aim to intimidate Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who faces a $50 million U.S. bounty on drug-trafficking charges. The significant military buildup, unprecedented since 1965, raises concerns among experts about the potential for regional escalation and the unusual nature of such military-led anti-drug operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. private sector hiring experienced a significant slowdown in August, with ADP reporting an increase of just 54,000 jobs, falling short of economist forecasts. This marks a notable deceleration from the previous month's revised gain and adds to growing concerns about the labor market's health. ADP's chief economist cited consumer worries, labor shortages, and AI disruptions as contributing factors to the decreased growth. The report highlights weakness in trade, transportation, utilities, education, and health services, though leisure and hospitality saw a boom.

          <p>Oil giant ConocoPhillips plans to lay off between 20% and 25% of its global workforce, impacting up to 3,250 employees and contractors, as part of a significant cost-cutting initiative. The company confirmed the reductions, with the majority expected by the end of 2025, citing the need for greater efficiency. This announcement follows a second-quarter earnings report that, while beating Wall Street expectations, showed a decline from the previous year. CEO Ryan Lance reportedly communicated the plans in a video message, emphasizing the need for fewer roles due to rising costs, leading to a dip in the company's stock.</p>

However, concerns about slowing revenue growth for the third quarter, partly attributed to the success of its Dev Mode product, impacted investor sentiment. Figma also announced new AI-powered design tools and recent acquisitions, emphasizing that AI will enhance designers' roles rather than displace them.

          <p>A powerful magnitude-6.0 earthquake, followed by a magnitude-5.2 aftershock, has devastated Afghanistan, claiming over 2,200 lives and injuring nearly 4,000, primarily in mountainous Kunar province. Rescue efforts are severely hampered by rockfalls and landslides, which have blocked roads and isolated remote villages where many survivors are believed to be trapped. Aid agencies warn of rapidly growing humanitarian needs, as the country already grapples with a prolonged crisis, displacement, and an influx of returning refugees. The reduced foreign aid since the Taliban's 2021 takeover further weakens Afghanistan's capacity to respond to this catastrophic natural disaster.</p>

The court heard that Linehan also allegedly knocked the activist's phone out of her hand during a confrontation. Linehan has pleaded not guilty to both charges, claiming he was acting as a journalist to expose "trans activities" and that the phone incident was a reflex.

This move comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 that Trump exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose steep levies on trading partners. The administration argues that delaying a decision could lead to significant disruption from unwinding collected tariffs, which could amount to $750 billion-$1 trillion. The appeals court has paused its ruling until October 14, providing time for the Supreme Court to consider the appeal.</p>

Lee, and his administration's actions against institutions like the Smithsonian. The author contends that Trump's "neo-Confederate culture war" serves as a cover for a political assault on civil rights amendments and policies, rather than an attempt to reveal a true story. This perspective suggests Trump's historical revisionism aligns with a "lost cause" mythology and aims to dismantle progress made since the Civil Rights era.</p>

          <p>U.S. job cuts in the first eight months of the year have surged 66% compared to the previous year, surpassing the total for all of 2024, according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The significant increase is attributed to government cost-cutting initiatives, particularly the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alongside broader economic uncertainty and the impact of artificial intelligence. California and the tech industry have been severely affected, while sectors like finance and retail also experienced substantial reductions. The report highlights a challenging labor market, with concerns for the upcoming holiday shopping season due to tariffs and consumer spending constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy is expected to promote his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, aiming to eliminate bureaucracy and conflicts of interest.

The administration had claimed the freeze was in response to antisemitism on campus, but Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the action. Judge Allison D. Burroughs' ruling cited that the freeze was implemented without considering Harvard's existing steps to address antisemitism and violated the university's First Amendment rights. The judge noted the defunded research, which included studies on Alzheimer's and heart disease, had no clear connection to campus antisemitism, strengthening Harvard's position in the ongoing dispute.</p>

Schulman's strategy focuses on embracing Burberry's iconic pieces and implementing cost-cutting measures, aiming for £80 million in annualized savings by fiscal year 2026, signaling renewed investor confidence in the brand's turnaround.

Kennedy Jr., despite the current stability of childhood vaccine schedules. Science writer Katie Wu argues that Kennedy is establishing a narrative of distrust in the vaccine system, exemplified by his restriction of COVID vaccine access and the ousting of CDC officials. This approach, she explains, sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied to other vaccines, leading to a fragmented public health landscape. The article highlights how states are now charting different paths, from coordinating vaccine recommendations to ending mandates, creating confusion and potentially endangering public health.</p>
