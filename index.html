          <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky responded cautiously to Russia's offer of direct talks, emphasizing the need for an immediate cease-fire, while President Trump urged both sides to meet in Turkey to determine the possibility of a deal. European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, with the United States also prepared to impose sanctions if Russia doesn't agree to the truce. Putin called for direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, but did not accept the cease-fire proposal, wanting Western governments to stop supplying arms to Ukraine first.

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8, valued at approximately $400 million, as a gift from Qatar's royal family, triggering accusations of bribery and corruption.

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Walton Goggins as a server aggressively flirting with middle-aged mothers is critiqued for reinforcing stereotypes about women's desirability and sexuality. The article argues that the sketch, while seemingly intended to challenge the idea that mothers are sexless, ultimately undermined this notion by implying it was ridiculous for the server to genuinely desire the "silly, frumpy old moms." Another segment of "Weekend Update" further reinforced the view that motherhood is antithetical to sexuality.
