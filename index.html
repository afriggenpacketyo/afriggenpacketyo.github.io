          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for another round of peace talks brokered by the U.S., aiming to end the ongoing conflict. These talks follow a recent Ukrainian drone attack on strategic bomber bases inside Russia, which Moscow has framed as a terrorist act. Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire, prisoner release, and the return of abducted children, while Russia demands annexation of Ukrainian regions and a block on Ukraine's NATO accession. Despite President Trump's efforts, deep divisions persist, and both sides accuse each other of sabotaging the negotiation process, with long-range drone and missile attacks continuing overnight. The situation remains tense as both sides prepare for discussions. Optimism remains tempered by ongoing hostilities and distrust.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago. This redesign aims to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The plans also intend to reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. The government says UKADS will be fully operational by the end of the year, representing the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s.</p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, daughter of the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, openly lived in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and defied social norms. As the Nazi regime rose to power, she used her privilege and resources to help Jewish families escape persecution by providing financial support and guaranteeing immigration documents. Catherine hosted Jewish refugees at her home in England and advocated for those interned as "enemy aliens."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. defense sector is significantly dependent on China for critical minerals essential to advanced weapon systems, creating a vulnerability as Beijing tightens export restrictions. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and most other critical minerals, giving it leverage in trade negotiations and the ability to target defense industries. Recent export controls imposed by Beijing on gallium, germanium, antimony, and certain rare earth elements have raised concerns about the Pentagon's military readiness and supply chain security. This dependence underscores the strategic importance of diversifying critical mineral sources.</p>

China maintains that the U.S. is deploying offensive weaponry in the South China Sea and inciting conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.

          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic* by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships shape individuals, focusing on birth order and achievements of siblings. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can be powerful, with children spurred to succeed in different fields based on what their siblings are doing. Siblings can act as mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits, and offering unique perspectives that challenge one's self-perception, as they have seen every side of each other.</p>

Baerbock's nomination faced some internal criticism due to a prior agreement to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid.

          <p>Despite President Trump's promise to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day, progress remains elusive more than four months into his second term. Russia and Ukraine are scheduled for another round of peace negotiations in Istanbul, but both sides remain entrenched in their positions. Trump has expressed frustration with the process, hinting at a potential withdrawal of U.S. involvement if progress isn't made soon. Experts caution that a U.S. withdrawal could shift the balance of power in favor of Russia, while others suggest that reduced presidential engagement could be beneficial if it allows working-level officials to continue negotiations.</p>

While the EU Commission President expressed confidence in continued cooperation, Nawrocki has taken a more critical stance toward Ukraine and has ruled out the country's NATO aspirations.

Research indicates that air pollution from fossil fuels directly harms student learning, even when considering socioeconomic factors.

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential election, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski in a tight race. The outcome signals a potential shift towards a more populist and nationalist path for Poland under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump. While the EU Commission President expressed confidence in continued cooperation, Nawrocki's victory complicates Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his agenda. Nawrocki has echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine, promising to continue Poland's support but criticizing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

At issue is how to balance the needs of tech and creative sectors, specifically how to fairly allow AI developers access to creative content for training purposes without undermining the livelihoods of content creators. The Data (Use and Access) Bill is currently stalled, with the House of Lords disagreeing with the bill's current form. The debate centers on whether AI firms should be forced to disclose and license copyrighted material used for training, or whether developers should have access to all content unless owners opt out.</p>
