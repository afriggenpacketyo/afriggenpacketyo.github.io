          <h2>Experts Disagree on Extent of Damage to Iranian Nuclear Facilities After US Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:55:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, officials and experts have offered conflicting assessments regarding the damage inflicted. Defense Secretary Hegseth claimed the Iranian nuclear program was "obliterated," while Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Caine stated that a full assessment would take time. An Israeli source indicated the operation aimed to degrade, not eliminate, Iran's nuclear capabilities. Ballistic experts expressed skepticism about the damage to the underground Fordo facility, but the IAEA confirmed significant damage to the above-ground Natanz facility. The true extent of the damage remains uncertain until international inspectors gain access to the sites, but the attacks risk permanently estranging Iran from international legal frameworks. The environmental impact is expected to be localized, with no elevated radioactivity reported.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE custody, has spoken out against his detention, asserting his commitment to fighting for Palestinian rights. Khalil, detained for over three months, refuted the Trump administration's claims that he poses a threat to U.S. national security, describing his detention as a "kidnapping" where his rights were disregarded. Despite being denied the opportunity to be present for his son's birth, Khalil remains steadfast in his advocacy, asserting that no threat will deter him from speaking out against injustice. He emphasized that there is no place for antisemitism or racism within the Palestinian movement and welcomes Jewish students as integral members.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a U.S. analyst, China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it amid rising Middle East tensions. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests, rather than direct military intervention. This is exemplified by China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels from attacks. China's focus remains on protecting its economic interests, even though a significant portion of its seaborne crude oil comes from Iran.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to allocating 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security, such as border control and protection against cyber attacks. The aim is to accommodate US President Trump's call for increased NATO spending while offering EU countries flexibility. The government expects to reach 4.1% by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then, but has not specified how the 3.5% target will be funded. The National Security Strategy emphasizes competitiveness in science, education, and technology and highlights the job creation benefits of defense investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The division of power between Congress and the President regarding military action is a complex issue, as the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while the President serves as Commander in Chief. This has led to debate over the authority to engage in hostilities abroad, particularly in the context of modern warfare. The use of Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) has become common, with Congress not formally declaring war since 1942. Recent strikes on Iran have reignited discussions on the need for Congressional approval, highlighting differing opinions among lawmakers regarding the extent of presidential authority and the potential for broader conflict.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with a missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, but the limited damage and lack of casualties suggest a potential de-escalation. President Trump stated that Iran had gotten it out of their "system" and expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. If Iran refrains from further attacks, Trump may hold his fire and pursue negotiations. This scenario mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where limited Iranian retaliation led to de-escalation, suggesting Trump's high-risk strategy could yield positive results.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland. The justices, in a 6-3 decision, reversed a lower court order that required the government to provide migrants with a "meaningful opportunity" to express potential risks in being deported to a third country. The three liberal justices dissented, criticizing the ruling in the case of eight migrants, convicted of serious crimes, who were deported to South Sudan in May. This decision marks another victory for the president's efforts to pursue mass deportations.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without giving them a chance to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death. The order is a victory for the Trump administration, which has faced setbacks in its efforts to swiftly deport migrants. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct" and undermining due process. The administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens, and has an arrangement with El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants it claims are gang members.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, with no reported injuries. Beyond direct attacks on U.S. military assets in the Middle East, Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz, disrupting global oil supplies, or engage in asymmetric warfare, including terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. operates numerous military bases across the Middle East, with Al Udeid in Qatar housing up to 10,000 personnel. The long-term threat lies in asymmetric warfare and state-sponsored terrorism, as warned by the U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System.</p>

          <p>At least 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save £5bn a year by 2030. The amendment notes "the need for the reform of the social security system" before outlining reasons why the bill should be rejected. The reasons it lists for thwarting the bill include the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and on people's health.</p>

          <p>Anna Repkina, a Moscow native, was found murdered on a remote Oregon logging road in April 2017, leading investigators to uncover a complex love triangle. Repkina had met American Will Hargrove online and moved to the U.S. to marry him, unaware that he was also involved with Michelle Chavez. Chavez, who had been dating Hargrove before Repkina's arrival, issued an ultimatum, demanding that he choose between them. Days later, Repkina was found dead, and Hargrove was arrested for her murder, though the defense suggested Chavez was responsible. Hargrove was eventually found guilty, but his conviction was later overturned on appeal, and a new trial began in April 2025.</p>
