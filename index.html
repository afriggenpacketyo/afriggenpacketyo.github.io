          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old, pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back from El Salvador. Federal prosecutors accuse him of conspiring to transport undocumented migrants, including minors, from Mexico and Central America for profit. During the arraignment, Homeland Security special agent Pete Joseph testified about a 2022 traffic stop involving Abrego Garcia and his passengers. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argued that the government's case relies on witnesses who received deals in exchange for their testimony, questioning the credibility of the evidence presented by the prosecution.

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla's forcible removal from a Department of Homeland Security press conference led to widespread media attention and political reactions. The incident occurred during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, prompting President Trump to mobilize the National Guard and implement curfews.

Following the incident, Padilla and Senate Democrats launched fundraising campaigns, accusing the Trump administration of authoritarianism and attacking freedom of speech.</p>

This listing comes after more than 15 years of planning, marked by postponements and a Brazilian government investigation into corruption within the company. JBS, the world's largest meatpacking company, has faced opposition to its U.S. listing due to its history of corruption and bribery allegations.

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran, the conflict's outcome hinges on several factors, including Israel's objective, Iran's retaliatory capabilities, and Iran's future nuclear ambitions. While Israel claims its objective is limited to demolishing Iran's nuclear program, the targets of the strikes raise questions about a broader regime change agenda. Iran's capacity to strike back is uncertain, with its proxy network weakened but potential for devastating responses still present. The conflict's impact on Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons remains unclear, with possibilities ranging from deterring nuclear development to accelerating it.</p>

The last major military display was in 1991 to mark the end of the Gulf War, which drew some pushback over its cost.

While the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas exposed Israel's lack of preparation for that type of conflict, the country's resources were focused on countering the greater threat posed by Iran and Hezbollah. Israel has now begun employing similar strategies against Iran, targeting key military leaders and infrastructure.

          <p>Iran launched missiles at Israel, some hitting Tel Aviv, in retaliation for Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and commanders. Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepted most missiles, but some structures were damaged, and injuries were reported. The United States assisted Israel in intercepting the missiles. Israel's airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, with Prime Minister Netanyahu stating the goal was to "roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival."</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that a rare earth minerals shortage caused the automaker to temporarily shut down one of its plants last month. Rare earth minerals are essential for automobile production, with about 90% of the U.S.'s supply coming from China. China's export controls on these materials, amid trade tensions with the U.S., have created challenges for U.S. automakers. Following discussions, the U.S. and China reached an agreement for Beijing to resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S., bringing optimism for easing supply constraints.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran, the extent of potential US involvement remains a key question. While President Trump initially opposed the attack, he has since associated himself with the operation. The Trump administration hopes the strikes will force Iran to make concessions in nuclear negotiations, but Iran has threatened retaliation. The American role in the conflict could escalate if Israel requires US assistance to degrade Iran's nuclear enrichment capability or if Iran attacks American interests in the region.</p>
