          <p>Deliberations have commenced in the federal trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces charges of racketeering and sex trafficking that could result in a life sentence. The jury, composed of eight men and four women, will review seven weeks of testimony, including graphic accounts from former girlfriends and video evidence of violent encounters. Prosecutors argued that Combs used his power and wealth to coerce victims, while the defense maintained that the sexual acts were consensual and that the case is financially motivated. Combs has pleaded not guilty and did not testify in his own defense.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with votes on President Trump's extensive budget bill, aiming to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The bill includes significant tax cuts, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, but also proposes controversial spending cuts that could affect health insurance for millions of Americans. The legislation faces a narrow path to approval, with Republicans able to afford only a few defections for it to pass. The bill's passage has been complicated by internal Republican dissent, particularly over its impact on Medicaid and the national debt, which is projected to increase by $3.3 trillion under the Senate's version.</p>

          <p>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is facing significant questioning from fellow Labour MPs regarding proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefit system. The government recently altered its plan, stating that stricter eligibility criteria would only apply to new claimants after November 2026, not existing ones. However, many backbenchers are challenging the logic of implementing these changes before a comprehensive review of the assessment process is completed. Kendall defended the reforms as necessary to ensure the welfare system is fair and sustainable for the future, despite concerns about creating a two-tier system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Harvard University of violating civil rights laws through "deliberate indifference" to the harassment and discrimination of Jewish and Israeli students. In a letter, the government threatened the loss of all federal funding if the university does not implement immediate corrective measures to combat antisemitism on campus. The notice details incidents where Jewish students were physically assaulted and subjected to antisemitic imagery.

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third critically wounded in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being deliberately ambushed by a gunman. Authorities report that the suspect intentionally started a brush fire on Canfield Mountain to lure first responders to the remote, wooded area. The gunman, armed with a high-powered rifle, then opened fire on the responding crews in what the local sheriff described as a "total ambush." Following an hours-long standoff that prompted a shelter-in-place order for the community, the suspect was located deceased on the mountain, with a weapon found nearby. The motive for the attack is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a controversial plan to cut forecasters' access to a key satellite data program essential for hurricane prediction. The decision to delay followed an apparent intervention from a senior NASA official, after scientists warned the move could set hurricane forecasting back by decades. The data, collected by Department of Defense satellites, was scheduled to be cut off on June 30. The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the initial plan, a justification that had not been previously publicized, while assuring the quality of forecasts would not be affected.</p>

Tillis argues the legislation breaks Trump's promise to protect Medicaid and would devastate his home state of North Carolina with an estimated $26 billion cut. His vocal dissent, which he explained in a fiery floor speech, came after Trump threatened to support a primary challenger, prompting Tillis to announce his retirement. While some Democrats have praised his courage, it remains uncertain if his stand will persuade other concerned Republicans to vote against the bill.</p>

The BBC, which broadcast the set, called the sentiments "utterly unacceptable," and the U.S. State Department announced it would revoke the band's visas.

          <p>The White House asserted that Canada "caved" to President Trump after the country rescinded its planned digital services tax (DST). The move came after Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations with Ottawa if the tax, which would have primarily affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the reversal as a "big victory for our tech companies and our American workers." Following Canada's concession, trade talks have resumed, with top economic aide Kevin Hassett suggesting the U.S. will pressure other nations to drop similar taxes as part of future negotiations.</p>

However, key components like imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients and increasing funding for border security show a near-even split among voters.

The review notes that the movie is incurious about its creatures and characters, with bloodless action and a predictable narrative.

The suspect, Curtis Lear, was identified and arrested two days later after investigators tracked his vehicle's license plate. When stopped by an officer, he reportedly stated, "It's just a joke," and has not yet entered a plea to the federal charges.</p>

          <h2>Cultural Explainer: The Rise of 'Crashing Out' as a Gen Z Term for Mental Overload</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 14:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The slang term "crashing out" has gained prominence, particularly among Gen Z, to describe a wide range of behaviors stemming from being angry, anxious, or mentally overwhelmed. The phrase, popularized in music and on social media platforms like TikTok, is used to label everything from emotional breakdowns to public confrontations. This article explores why a generation fluent in pop-psychology is using such a broad term, suggesting it may reflect a growing resistance to traditional therapy and a turn toward online communities for validation. While some see it as a necessary form of catharsis, mental health professionals express concern about glorifying emotional dysregulation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of federal limits on coordinated campaign spending. The lawsuit, brought by the national Republican campaign committees for the House and Senate, argues that caps on how much a political party can spend in coordination with its own candidates violate the First Amendment. A ruling in favor of the GOP could dramatically increase the flow of money in elections, potentially starting with the 2026 midterms. Democratic committees have vowed to fight the effort, stating it would "sow chaos and fundamentally upend our campaign finance system."</p>

          <p>Southern California's wildfire season has started intensely, with several fires breaking out across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, forcing hundreds to evacuate.

Experts warn that despite a slight drop in temperatures, the landscape remains dangerously dry, priming much of the state for an active fire season. Officials have issued air quality alerts due to smoke and are concerned that Northern California could also see increased fire activity due to potential thunderstorms and gusty winds.</p>

A recent controversy erupted after the release of a former paramilitary leader allegedly involved in the 2013 Tadamon massacre, a decision made in the name of "peace and reconciliation." Critics argue that the newly established National Commission for Transitional Justice has a narrow mandate, focusing primarily on Assad regime crimes while excluding atrocities by other groups. This lack of transparency and perceived inaction has eroded public trust and led to a rise in vigilante justice.</p>

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's proposed budget bill would create a new federal income tax deduction for workers who earn tips, effectively making that income tax-free at the federal level. The White House frames this as a benefit for the working class, but critics argue its impact is limited. According to policy experts, over a third of tipped workers already earn too little to pay federal income tax and would not benefit. The proposed legislation also has variations, with the Senate version capping the deduction at $25,000 and phasing it out for higher earners, and the tax break itself is set to expire in 2028.</p>
