          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance. General Munir, previously known for his behind-the-scenes role, has been publicly addressing troops and projecting strength, particularly concerning Kashmir, which he described as Pakistan's "jugular vein." His comments, seen as a reflection of his hard-line views shaped by his intelligence background and religious beliefs, have heightened concerns in India, especially given the current political climate under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This article highlights the potential for further conflict and the role of international diplomacy in de-escalating the situation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit claims these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, arguing that the federal government has preeminent authority over immigration matters. The DOJ contends that Colorado's policies allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to gain control of an apartment complex in Aurora. The lawsuit names Governor Jared Polis, the state Legislature, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser as defendants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, arguing that the foreign production of films constitutes a national security threat. He claims that other countries offer incentives that attract filmmakers and studios, leading to a decline in the American movie industry. The details of the proposed tariffs remain unclear, including whether they would apply to American production companies filming abroad or to films on streaming services. The move has drawn criticism and concern from foreign governments and film industry bodies, who fear it will disrupt the global economy and increase prices on goods around the world.</p>

The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to trace the flower's origins. Ancestral trait reconstruction indicated that the common ancestor of Rosa most likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets.
