          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace was unacceptable and dangerous, though he noted it remains unclear if the drones were intentionally targeted at Poland. This incident prompted NATO to announce plans for bolstering Europe’s eastern flank defenses, marking the first known shots fired by a Western alliance member during the Ukraine war. Rubio emphasized the need for all facts and consultation with allies before determining the nature of the escalation. The article highlights the delicate diplomatic tightrope walked by the US in responding to potential provocations near NATO borders.</p>

          <p>The Taliban announced an agreement with US envoys regarding a prisoner exchange, as part of broader efforts to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan. While the Taliban released photographs from the talks in Kabul, the White House did not immediately comment on the reported detainee swap. This meeting follows the Taliban's release of US citizen George Glezmann in March, and discussions also covered bilateral relations, citizen issues, and investment opportunities. The article signals a potential, albeit unconfirmed, step towards diplomatic engagement and resolution of detainee issues between the two entities.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 people participated in a march in central London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, with a smaller counter-protest also taking place. The 'Unite the Kingdom' rally, featuring speeches from figures like Elon Musk via videolink, saw instances of violence against police officers, resulting in nine arrests. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the assaults on police, emphasizing that criminal activity would face the full force of the law. This article highlights the significant turnout for Robinson's demonstration, reflecting rising anti-immigration sentiment and free speech debates in Britain, alongside the challenges faced by law enforcement in managing such large-scale protests.</p>

          <p>Lawyers and advocates are expressing grave concerns that approximately 1,000 Central American children, including dozens in California, face imminent deportation to dangerous conditions in their home countries. This comes before their immigration court proceedings are finalized, with scheduled hearings reportedly vanishing from court calendars. A federal judge previously blocked a flight attempting to deport 76 Guatemalan children, many of whom feared gang violence and abuse upon return. This article details the government's expanding list of children from Honduras and El Salvador, raising alarms about the violation of due process and the potential for severe harm to vulnerable minors.</p>

          <p>Georgia prosecutors faced a major setback as a judge dismissed Rico conspiracy charges against 61 defendants involved in protests against the 'Cop City' police training center.

This decision, nearly three years after arrests, invalidates most of the indictment, exposing what critics call prosecutorial overreach and procedural negligence.
