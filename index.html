          <p>Jockey Patrick Mullins secured a memorable victory in the Grand National at Aintree, riding Nick Rockett to first place. The win was especially poignant for trainer Willie Mullins, Patrick's father, whose horses claimed the top three positions in the prestigious race. Nick Rockett, a 33-1 outsider, edged out last year's champion, I Am Maximus, who finished second, followed by Grangeclare West in third. The victory held extra emotion for owner Stewart Andrew, whose late wife Sadie had passed away in December 2022 shortly after watching Nick Rockett's debut race, making this win a tribute to her memory.</p>

The National Weather Service has issued flash flood emergencies across several states, with dozens of river locations expected to reach major flood stage, threatening critical infrastructure and transportation. The extreme weather has also impacted interstate commerce, with potential shipping and supply chain delays anticipated due to flooding in major cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis.</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei reaffirmed his support for Donald Trump at a Mar-a-Lago event, even as global leaders grappled with the implications of Trump's newly announced tariffs. Milei's visit underscores his alignment with Trump's policies, including austerity measures and a stance against the "woke" left. Despite the flattery, Argentina faces a 10% minimum tariff, framed by officials as preferential treatment. Milei hopes his close ties with Trump will secure a crucial $20 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund to support Argentina's economic reforms, but a meeting with Trump did not occur.</p>

          <p>Korn Ferry Tour golfer Ryan McCormick employed an unusual method to control his anger during a tournament round: taping his mouth shut. McCormick, known for struggling with his temper on the course, decided to experiment with this approach to improve his composure and create a better environment for his playing partners. He communicated with his caddie using pen and paper, focusing on simplifying his interactions. While the effectiveness of the tape on his anger is debatable, it didn't positively impact his game, as he missed the cut after shooting a 72.</p>

He felt Arsenal controlled the match but conceded a penalty due to a referee decision, further lamenting the numerous "silly fouls" that led to set-pieces for Everton. Conversely, Everton manager David Moyes refrained from commenting on the penalty decision, stating he had not reviewed the play.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs has caused widespread confusion among global leaders and significant disruption in financial markets. The move has prompted discussions about the potential fallout from America's shift in international trade policy.

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 2,200 points and the Nasdaq entering a bear market, as concerns grew about the economic impact of new U.S. tariffs and a potential global trade war.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the tariffs are likely to increase inflation and slow economic growth.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs has led to significant turmoil in the stock market, exceeding worst-case scenarios. The plan to impose 10% tariffs on every U.S. trading partner and individualized rates for specific countries has sparked retaliatory measures from China and concerns about the global economy. Economists criticize the rudimentary math behind the tariffs, and markets have responded with a sharp sell-off. The Federal Reserve's indication that the tariffs would boost inflation further dampened investor hopes for a market rescue.</p>

          <h2>Why 'Dead' Investors Often Outperform the Living</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inactive investors who adopt a "buy and hold" strategy often achieve better returns than active traders, according to investment experts. This is because active trading typically incurs higher costs and taxes and is often driven by impulsive, emotional decision-making. Data shows that the average stock investor's return lagged the S&P 500 stock index by a significant margin in 2023, highlighting the detrimental impact of bad habits. Emotional impulses to sell during downturns or buy into trending assets are common pitfalls that can lead to major losses.  &#x3c;br&#x3e;&#x3c;i&#x3e;(not investment advice)&#x3c;/i&#x3e;</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced it will "pause" shipments to the United States in response to President Trump's implementation of a 25% tariff on imported cars. The company is working to "address the new trading terms" and develop mid- to longer-term plans. The U.S. is an important market for JLR, with exports nearly equal to those sold to the UK and EU combined. The company has reassured customers that its business is "resilient" and "accustomed to changing market conditions."</p>

Her influence marks a shift towards a more extreme stance within the administration, raising concerns about the direction of policy and the acceptance of bigotry.</p>

          <p>The Senate approved a Republican plan for trillions in tax breaks and spending cuts, facing strong Democratic opposition and dissent from some GOP senators. The plan, central to President Trump's agenda, comes amid economic turmoil caused by his tariff scheme. Democrats accuse Republicans of paving the way for cuts to key safety net programs to fund tax cuts benefiting the wealthy. The framework now goes to the House for consideration, with challenges expected in reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions.</p>

          <p>Theodore McCarrick, a former Catholic cardinal who was defrocked in 2019 following allegations of sexual abuse, died at the age of 94. The McCarrick scandal created a crisis of credibility for the Catholic Church due to evidence that Vatican and U.S. church leaders were aware of his misconduct but failed to take action. Survivors of abuse expressed frustration that McCarrick never faced trial for his actions. McCarrick's death marks the end of a controversial figure in the Catholic Church's history.</p>
