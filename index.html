        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Derrick Groves, the final escapee from a New Orleans jailbreak in May, has been apprehended in Atlanta after a five-month manhunt. Federal law enforcement, acting on a Crime Stoppers tip, located Groves hiding within a reinforced crawl space in an Atlanta home. Groves, convicted of a 2018 double murder, was believed to be a ringleader in the May 16 escape from the Orleans Parish Justice Center, an event that exposed significant design flaws and security failures. His capture, achieved without injury or resistance, successfully concludes the extensive multi-agency investigation to return all ten escapees to custody, with Groves now facing additional charges related to the escape and expected extradition to Louisiana. The operation highlights the persistence of law enforcement and the importance of public engagement in fugitive cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is furloughing nearly half of its workforce, affecting approximately 34,000 employees, as the government shutdown extends into its second week. This significant reduction leaves only about 54% of staff on duty, leading to the suspension of most operations, including critical taxpayer services like call centers and general administrative support. However, essential functions such as tax processing to safeguard government revenue, IT and data-protection systems, and criminal investigations will continue under a contingency plan. The furloughs stem from a funding impasse between President Trump and Congress, with the National Treasury Employees Union expressing alarm over increased wait times, backlogs, and the impact on dedicated public servants.</p>

          <p>The Palace Museum, established in Beijing's Forbidden City in 1925, is celebrating its centenary, now existing across four locations including Taipei and Hong Kong. A significant and dramatic aspect of this article's history involves the perilous 10,000-mile wartime trek of 20,000 crates of priceless relics between 1933 and 1950. This monumental effort saw the treasures travel through battle-ravaged cities to China's western hinterland, safeguarding an invaluable part of the nation's cultural heritage from destruction. However, the collection remains physically divided between Beijing and Taipei's National Palace Museum, a split seen by some as a continuing barometer of political tensions across the Taiwan Strait, even as all museums mark this major milestone.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, publicly confronted House Speaker Mike Johnson, urging him to swear in Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election to replace her late father. Johnson, however, refused to administer the oath of office until government funding is restored, tying the issue directly to the ongoing shutdown. Grijalva suspects the delay is a tactic to prevent her vote on legislation requiring the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, an accusation Johnson vehemently denied, calling it a "publicity stunt." This article underscores the deep partisan divisions and political maneuvering within Congress, where even a new representative's seating becomes entangled in broader legislative impasses.</p>

          <p>President Trump posted on Truth Social that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker "should be in jail" for allegedly failing to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Both Johnson and Pritzker vehemently condemned Trump's remarks, calling him "unstable" and "unhinged," and challenging him to act on his threats. This public dispute is set against a backdrop of escalating tensions over Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, a move both state and city leaders have legally challenged and vowed to resist. The White House further escalated the rhetoric, accusing the local leaders of being "Trump-Deranged buffoons" who prioritize politics over public safety.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that officials are "very close to a deal" to end the war in Gaza, following a third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt. Palestinian officials reported significant progress on prisoner-exchange lists and guarantees to prevent a return to fighting, with Hamas agreeing to release all Israeli hostages while delaying the handover of bodies. The negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, center on a 20-point peace plan proposed by Trump, which includes a ceasefire and Israeli troop withdrawals. Despite acknowledged "deep gaps" in interpreting the plan's details, particularly regarding troop withdrawal maps and exchange timetables, a cautious optimism for a breakthrough is noted among participants.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve officials remain divided and cautious regarding future interest rate cuts, as revealed in the minutes from their September meeting. While a majority supported further reductions this year, citing growing risks to the job market and diminished inflation threats, concerns about persistent inflation above the 2% target still exist. The central bank implemented a quarter-point rate cut, its first since December 2024, but some policymakers considered keeping rates unchanged or advocated for a larger cut.

          <p>Authorities in Albany, New York, have identified Joseph Nowakowski as the man responsible for the sexual assault, stabbing, and bludgeoning death of 50-year-old Catherine Blackburn in September 1964. Nowakowski, who died in 1998, was linked to the crime through DNA evidence, which was preserved from the crime scene and matched after his body was exhumed. This breakthrough, a result of collaboration between the Criminal Investigation Resource Center and other agencies, brings resolution to a 61-year-old cold case.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that a shortage of air traffic controllers is exacerbating U.S. flight delays, with thousands of flights impacted this week. While other factors like weather contribute, the shortfall has led the FAA to slow or halt arrivals at some airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted a "slight uptick" in sick calls among controllers, who are deemed "essential" workers and are working long shifts without pay during the government shutdown. This article highlights concerns about the strain on controllers and the need for congressional action to resolve the funding impasse and ensure aviation safety.</p>
