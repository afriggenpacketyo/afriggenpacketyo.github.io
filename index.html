        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American rare earth mining companies surged after China implemented stricter export controls on these critical minerals, which are vital for defense, technology, and electric vehicles. The new rules require licenses for exporting products containing rare earths, a move seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This has intensified speculation that the U.S. government will accelerate investments to build a domestic supply chain and reduce its dependency on China. The action heightens trade tensions ahead of a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge is expected to rule on a lawsuit filed by Illinois and the city of Chicago aiming to block the federal government from deploying the National Guard without state consent. The legal challenge comes after 500 troops were already sent to the area, a move President Trump justified by claiming the city is "out of control." State and city officials argue the deployment is unconstitutional and dangerous, creating a pretext for military action against civilians. The court's decision could set a significant precedent regarding federal authority over state-level military forces.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's stock is poised for its worst trading day in history after the luxury automaker issued full-year guidance that fell short of analyst expectations and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions. The company adjusted its 2030 model lineup target to include only 20% fully electric vehicles, down from a previous goal of 40%. This pivot comes as several global carmakers reconsider their EV sales targets due to market challenges. The disappointing forecast and revised electrification strategy prompted a significant sell-off of both its Milan- and New York-listed shares. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the updated federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year, adjusting them for inflation. This annual change is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without an actual increase in real income. For 2026, the standard deduction will increase for all filing statuses, such as to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. These adjustments mean Americans will be able to earn more before moving into a higher tax bracket, potentially providing some financial relief.</p>

          <p>Following an undercover BBC Panorama report exposing racism and misogyny at London's Charing Cross police station, ten officers will face accelerated misconduct hearings. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) stated it has sufficient evidence that the officers breached professional standards, with the watchdog's director general expressing she was "appalled." The investigation captured officers making derogatory comments about immigrants and being dismissive of sexual assault claims. The hearings are intended to send a clear message that such behavior is taken seriously and could lead to the officers' dismissal.</p>

          <p>A Texas court has granted an emergency stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter based on a "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis. The halt was issued under a state law that allows convictions to be re-examined if they were based on scientific evidence that has since been discredited. Roberson has consistently maintained his daughter's death was due to pneumonia complications, and his lawyers argue the case was built on outdated medical theories. The decision allows for a re-evaluation of the scientific evidence used in his original trial.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to double tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at addressing global overproduction and protecting its domestic industry. The decision mirrors similar tariffs imposed by the U.S., prompting speculation that the EU is using the measure as leverage to negotiate better trade terms with the Trump administration. While the EU frames the policy as a fair system that still allows for tariff-free imports up to a certain volume, China has labeled it a protectionist act.

          <p>Delta Air Lines has issued an optimistic financial forecast for the remainder of 2025 and into the next year, exceeding Wall Street expectations. The airline's strong performance is attributed to rising airfares and sustained high demand for premium cabin seating, including first class and roomier economy options. Revenue from these premium products grew by 9% in the third quarter, nearly matching sales from the main cabin. The positive outlook suggests a recovery in demand and signals that consumer confidence in luxury travel remains resilient despite broader economic pressures.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has forecast that Tropical Storm Jerry is likely to strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend as it moves across the Atlantic. The storm is currently on a path that will take it near or northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, where tropical storm conditions are expected. While not a direct threat to the U.S. mainland at this time, the system is expected to bring heavy rainfall and the risk of flash flooding to the islands. Swells generated by Jerry are also likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions in the region.</p>

          <p>Though weakening off Mexico's Pacific coast, Tropical Storm Priscilla is expected to bring significant moisture and a threat of flash flooding to the southwestern United States. Forecasters predict that remnants of the storm will deliver two to four inches of rain across parts of Arizona, Utah, and Colorado through the weekend. While the storm's core will remain offshore, the associated rainfall could lead to numerous instances of flash flooding, particularly in central Arizona. Large swells from the system are also creating dangerous surf conditions along the coast of Baja California.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has claimed that a vessel recently bombed by the United States in the Caribbean was carrying Colombian citizens, an allegation the White House has called "baseless." The U.S. has conducted at least four strikes on boats in international waters in recent weeks, stating they were targeting "narco-traffickers," but has not provided details on the identities of the 21 people killed. The military actions have drawn condemnation from regional leaders over concerns they may violate international law. The incident has opened up a new point of tension between the U.S. and Colombia.</p>
