          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a "framework" deal for social media platform TikTok between U.S. and Chinese private parties, with Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping scheduled to finalize terms on Friday. This significant development aims to pivot TikTok towards U.S.-controlled ownership, directly addressing long-standing national security concerns that had threatened to shut down the popular app in the country. The agreement follows months of intricate trade discussions and multiple deadline extensions for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business. This article highlights the ongoing diplomatic efforts to navigate complex U.S.-China relations and secure the future of a platform deeply valued by young Americans, balancing economic interests with national security imperatives.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed profound regret over his decision to appoint Lord Peter Mandelson as U.S. ambassador, stating he would have "never" done so had he known the full details of Mandelson's relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer promptly sacked the Labour peer after leaked emails revealed Mandelson sent supportive messages to Epstein, even advising him to "fight for early release" following his 2008 guilty plea. The Prime Minister emphasized that Mandelson's actions directly contradicted the government's steadfast approach to combating violence against women and girls. This scandal has significantly intensified scrutiny over Starmer's judgment and leadership within the Labour Party, just weeks after another high-profile resignation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is escalating demands that European NATO nations completely cease all energy purchases from Russia before the U.S. implements its own new sanctions on Moscow. Trump sharply criticized European allies for not doing enough to counter Russia's actions in Ukraine, despite the EU's recent sanctions and their reduced reliance on Russian oil. He indicated a strong willingness to impose "major sanctions" from the U.S., but only if NATO members demonstrate commensurate resolve, potentially extending the ban to liquefied natural gas imports. This article highlights Europe's continued, albeit diminished, energy imports from Russia and underscores Trump's broader foreign policy stance, which also includes calls for significant tariffs on China.

          <p>American Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from his world championships semi-final for "jostling" after making contact with Germany's Robert Farken on the home straight. Hocker, who finished second in the race, attempted to force his way through a narrow gap, disrupting Farken's rhythm. The U.S. team's appeal against the disqualification was rejected, ending Hocker's championship bid. This incident highlights the strict rules against physical contact in competitive track events, even when athletes are seeking an opening. The decision underscores the importance of fair play and adherence to regulations in high-stakes athletic competitions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump proposed a significant change to corporate reporting, suggesting that companies should shift from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. He argued this adjustment would substantially save money for businesses and enable managers to concentrate more effectively on long-term company operations, drawing a comparison to China's perceived longer-term management perspectives. While current regulations mandate quarterly reports, the concept of less frequent reporting has garnered historical support from influential figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who advocated against quarterly guidance. However, critics express concerns that such a move could diminish transparency and reduce timely information for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI's Co-Deputy Director Dan Bongino revealed that the suspect arrested in the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, Tyler Robinson, harbored an "obsession" with Kirk, as evidenced by his extensive digital footprint.

Authorities are actively investigating whether any individuals had prior knowledge of the alleged shooter's intentions or the potential for violence, particularly concerning online communications Robinson allegedly had about Kirk.

          <p>A leading psychology expert advocates for abandoning generic conversational starters like "How are you?" to foster genuine trust and connection with others. Instead, the article suggests employing open-ended questions that actively seek out positive experiences or excitement in people's lives, such as "What's the highlight of your week so far?" It also advises responding to common, uninspired questions with a touch of humor or whimsy to make interactions more memorable and engaging. Furthermore, maintaining open body language, like uncrossed arms and direct facing, and practicing these subtle techniques in everyday low-pressure situations are highlighted as crucial steps for building rapport and deeper, more authentic connections.</p>

          <p>Sushila Karki, a distinguished 73-year-old former chief justice, has been appointed as Nepal's first woman interim prime minister, a decision that follows widespread and often violent Gen Z-led protests against pervasive corruption and economic hardship. Karki, renowned for her unwavering integrity and strong anti-corruption stance, is tasked with guiding the Himalayan nation towards fresh elections scheduled for March 5, 2026. Her historic appointment is widely perceived as a reflection of society's evolving trust in women's leadership and a "revolution of commonsense" driven by a restless generation. Karki faces immediate challenges in rebuilding public infrastructure damaged during the protests, ensuring timely and fair elections, and implementing crucial reforms within political parties.</p>

While Germany maintains the matter is legally settled, Nawrocki's stance is firm.
