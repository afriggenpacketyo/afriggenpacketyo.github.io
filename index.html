          <p>Donald Trump has called for American commercial and military ships to have free passage through the Panama and Suez Canals, directing his secretary of state to address the issue promptly. Trump asserted that these routes owe their existence to the U.S., while the Panamanian president clarified that canal toll fees are regulated by the Panama Canal Authority. The U.S. Defense Secretary had previously suggested an agreement for U.S. warships to pass through the Panama Canal for free and proposed the return of U.S. troops to secure it, which was rejected by Panama. The Suez Canal's revenues have significantly decreased due to Houthi rebel attacks on shipping routes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's upcoming election has seen a dramatic shift with Liberal leader Mark Carney gaining ground against Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, largely due to the looming presence of Donald Trump and his threats of tariffs. Carney is presenting himself as a steady leader capable of navigating the challenges posed by the U.S. president, while Poilievre focuses on domestic issues like housing shortages and the economy. The resignation of Justin Trudeau and the subsequent rise of Carney have energized the Liberal party, which had previously been trailing significantly in polls. Trump's trade threats and annexation talk have motivated left-leaning voters to support Carney, who is leveraging the situation to demonstrate his leadership abilities.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is struggling to find a unified message and direction in the face of Donald Trump's presidency, facing internal divisions and a lack of clear leadership. A recent rally featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in Bakersfield, California, highlighted the frustration of many Democrats who feel the party is not doing enough to protect their interests. While some advocate for stronger opposition to Trump's agenda, others believe the party needs to broaden its appeal by moving towards the center.

While the conference was a success for the Global South, the U.S. attempted to undermine it, fearing it would bolster China and the Soviet Union's influence.

          <p>Donald Trump attended Pope Francis' funeral at the Vatican, meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the first time since their February exchange. Following the meeting, Trump posted on social media criticizing Putin's missile strikes on civilian areas, suggesting a change in his approach to the conflict. The meeting occurred amidst new polling data indicating historically low approval ratings for Trump as he nears his 100th day in office. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re's homily during the funeral seemed to allude to past tensions between Trump and the late Pope, particularly on migration policies.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and families gathered to commemorate the camp's horrors. British and Canadian troops entered the camp in April 1945, discovering thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. The camp's notoriety stems from the chilling accounts of journalists, soldiers, and photographers who documented the atrocities. Unlike other camps destroyed by the Nazis, Bergen-Belsen remained intact, bearing witness to the cruelty and incompetence that led to the deaths of tens ofthousands of people, most of whom were Jewish.</p>
