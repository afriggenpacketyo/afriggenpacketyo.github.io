          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) democracies have launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, aiming to reduce over-reliance on China. The plan involves increased cooperation among G7 members and like-minded nations to safeguard economic security against nonmarket practices. Areas of cooperation include monitoring mineral shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling efforts. The G7 leaders will develop a roadmap by the end of the year for standards-based markets for critical minerals, reflecting the true costs of extraction, processing, and trade.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to face a series of hearings before lawmakers, addressing topics ranging from the ban on transgender troops to the use of unsecured messaging apps for sensitive military plans. The hearings are expected to be dominated by the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, with questions arising about Hegseth's focus on social changes within the Pentagon versus critical international security crises. Lawmakers are also displeased with the lack of details provided on the administration's proposed defense budget. Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app to share military strike information is under investigation by the Pentagon's watchdog, adding to the scrutiny of his tenure.</p>

          <p>Several flights to and from Bali have been cancelled or delayed due to the eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki in Indonesia.

Air India, Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Juneyao Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Virgin Australia have cancelled flights to and from Bali.

          <p>UCLA's baseball season came to an end with a 7-3 loss to Arkansas in the College World Series. The Bruins struggled to score with runners in scoring position, ultimately failing to mount a comeback. Starting pitcher Cody Delvecchio had a rough outing, and the team's offense struggled throughout the game, hitting just .167 as a team. Despite a late rally in the ninth inning, UCLA's efforts fell short, marking the end of their journey in Omaha.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that Meta has offered his employees significant bonuses, including signing bonuses of $100 million, in an effort to recruit them. These recruitment attempts reflect the intense competition for AI talent among tech companies. Altman's comments come after Meta invested $14.3 billion in data-labeling startup Scale AI and hired its top boss to lead its new superintelligence team. Meta, previously recognized for its open-source AI models, has faced staff departures and delayed launches of new AI models.</p>
