          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from the US Open after a decisive 6-1 6-2 defeat by ninth seed Elena Rybakina. Raducanu, the 2021 champion, struggled against Rybakina's powerful returns and consistent baseline pressure, failing to gain momentum throughout the 62-minute match. The loss highlights Raducanu's ongoing challenge against top-10 opponents, providing a reality check despite her recent progress and return to form. Rybakina's victory marks her first time advancing past the third round at Flushing Meadows.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced the initial phase of an offensive into Gaza City, designating it a "dangerous combat zone" and halting humanitarian pauses. This escalation comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the recovery of the bodies of two hostages taken during the October 7th attack. The planned expansion has drawn international condemnation and sparked domestic protests from citizens and hostage families concerned about the safety of those still held captive. The move intensifies the nearly two-year-long conflict amid growing calls for a resolution and increased humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace negotiations. This move is unusual for a UN host country and comes as several allies, including France and the UK, plan to support the recognition of a Palestinian state. The action reflects the Trump administration's strong backing of Israel's position against a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has yet to rule on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. Cook's legal team argued that the basis for her removal, allegations of mortgage fraud from a political operative, constitutes an unsubstantiated smear campaign. The Department of Justice countered that the president has the discretion to determine if legal cause for removal exists. The judge has asked both sides to confer on the next legal steps, leaving Cook's position on the board uncertain for now.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's move to cancel $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding has drawn sharp criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who argue the action is illegal. The White House utilized a rare maneuver known as a "pocket rescission" to bypass the standard 45-day congressional review period for funding cuts. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins called the move a clear violation of the law, citing a Government Accountability Office finding that such actions are not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act. The controversial decision complicates upcoming negotiations to avoid a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Share prices for major UK banks, including NatWest and Lloyds, fell sharply following a proposal for a new windfall tax on banking profits. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank suggested the levy could raise up to £8 billion annually to offset taxpayer losses from the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. Banking industry representatives argue that an additional tax would harm the UK's international competitiveness, noting that banks already pay a corporation tax surcharge and a bank levy. The proposal adds pressure on the government ahead of its autumn Budget announcement.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal ruling has permitted the government to continue housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel in Epping, a technical legal victory for the Home Office. The decision prevents a wave of similar legal challenges from other local councils that could have disrupted the asylum accommodation system. However, the ruling places the Labour government in the politically difficult position of legally defending the use of hotels, a policy it has pledged to end. The outcome is likely to intensify political pressure from both opponents who criticize the practice and those who feel the government is not doing enough to control immigration.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is anticipating a record-setting Labor Day travel period, expecting to screen approximately 17.5 million people through Wednesday. The travel rush began amid disruptions, including a communications outage at a key air traffic control facility that caused hundreds of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Despite these challenges, millions of Americans are traveling to mark the end of summer, with most opting to drive, benefiting from slightly lower gas prices compared to last year. Airlines are also bracing for a surge, with major carriers expecting to fly around 7 million passengers.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. tariff exemption for imported packages valued under $800, known as the de minimis rule, has been ended by the Trump administration. This policy change will now require tariffs to be applied to millions of small, direct-to-consumer shipments from companies like Shein and Temu, as well as small overseas businesses. Experts predict the move could lead to higher prices and shipping delays for American shoppers, particularly affecting lower-income consumers who disproportionately utilized the exemption. The White House justified the change by citing risks to American manufacturers and national security.</p>

The digital transformation ministry intervened at the last minute, citing concerns related to "strategic autonomy" and digital strategy. The decision aligns Spain with broader EU and U.S. efforts to remove the Chinese tech giant from critical infrastructure due to security risks. The move reverses a previously approved plan and comes after Madrid had faced criticism for its continued reliance on Huawei equipment.</p>

          <p>The government of Guinea-Bissau has blocked several Portuguese public broadcasters and a news agency, escalating what press freedom advocates describe as a growing crackdown on media. Journalists report being systematically obstructed and insulted, creating an atmosphere of fear ahead of the November elections. International organizations like Reporters Without Borders have condemned the actions as a severe blow to press freedom, suggesting an intent to control election coverage.

The main opposition party, Chadema, was disqualified after refusing to sign an electoral code of conduct, and its leader remains jailed on treason charges. Another major party's candidate was also disqualified by the electoral commission.

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed that two individuals have died after consuming raw oysters contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria. The bacteria thrives in warm coastal waters and can cause severe illness, including necrotizing fasciitis, which is fatal in about one in five cases. So far this year, Louisiana has recorded 22 infections and four total deaths linked to the bacteria, with two fatalities from eating raw oysters and two from wound exposure to seawater.

          <p>A growing number of Americans are making hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) plans to cover financial emergencies, a trend financial planners warn should only be a last resort. Taking money from retirement accounts early is an expensive way to access cash, as it is subject to income tax and potential penalties, while also sacrificing future compound growth. Experts recommend building a dedicated emergency fund as the primary defense against unexpected costs. If that is not an option, alternatives like a 401(k) loan or tapping home equity are generally preferable to an outright withdrawal.</p>

This "reverse flow" migration, documented by Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica with UN support, highlights the impact of the U.S. ending asylum access through a government app. These returning migrants face increased vulnerability, having depleted their resources on the initial northbound trek through dangerous regions like the Darién Gap.</p>
