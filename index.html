          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 13:13:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Secretary announced new measures to alleviate overcrowding in England and Wales prisons by limiting the time some offenders spend in jail after breaching their licenses. This shake-up will release offenders after a fixed 28-day period, freeing up around 1,400 prison places and giving ministers time to overhaul the system. While a Â£4.7bn investment will fund more prisons, the Justice Secretary warned that this would not solve the crisis alone. The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, excluding those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

A key point of contention remains the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), with some lawmakers pushing for a higher limit than the proposed $30,000 for those with incomes under $400,000. The current $10,000 SALT cap was implemented to fund the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The full House vote is expected soon, but the legislation faces potential changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies have created uncertainty for American consumers, prompting concerns about higher prices and potential shortages. A recent U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China would cut tariffs on American goods to 10%. A trade agreement with the United Kingdom will also cut tariffs on cars and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. To mitigate the impact, experts recommend looking for sales, checking product origins, purchasing domestic products, and prioritizing essential items.</p>

High tariffs had previously threatened his ability to stock products, but the lowered levies provide a crucial window for importing dolls. Although a 30% tariff remains "painful," it's manageable compared to the previous 145%. This reprieve allows the company to continue serving its U.S. customers during the peak retail season.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to lower prescription drug prices have reignited debate about the high costs faced by U.S. patients. Americans pay significantly more for drugs than Europeans due to a complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. Drug prices are set by pharmaceutical companies and negotiated by private insurers, unlike in Europe where governments negotiate directly. While branded drugs are expensive, unbranded generics are cheaper for U.S. patients. The article also mentions a clampdown on pharmacy benefit managers as a potential solution.</p>

Despite costly, incremental gains, Russia insists Ukraine accept strict military limitations and cede territory. The situation poses a challenge for Washington, which seeks to convince Putin that warm ties with the U.S. are more beneficial than continued conflict. The analysis highlights Russia's desire for Ukraine to capitulate and a belief that U.S. support for Kyiv is waning.</p>
