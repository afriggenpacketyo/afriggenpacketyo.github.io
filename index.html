        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union officials are voicing alarm over China's decision to curb exports of rare earth minerals, a move seen as a strategic pressure tactic amid global trade disputes. A Member of the European Parliament described it as intentional coercion against Europe, not just collateral damage from the US-China conflict. While analysts acknowledge the concerns, they predict Europe will remain dependent on Chinese rare earths for at least another decade, as strategies like recycling and diversifying import sources will take significant time to implement.</p>

          <p>The UK's postal regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays and move to an every-other-weekday schedule. This change, intended to address financial pressures from declining letter volumes, will see second-class mail delivered three days one week and two days the next. While Royal Mail welcomed the reform for ensuring the service's sustainability, the decision has drawn criticism from consumer groups and politicians who fear it will negatively impact reliability for those who depend on the service.</p>

          <p>A court in Seoul has approved a new arrest warrant for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, four months after he was initially released from custody. The decision came after a special prosecutor argued Yoon posed a risk of destroying evidence related to his brief imposition of martial law in December. He now faces additional charges including abuse of power and obstruction of official duties, which could lead to an extended period of detention while he stands trial for the primary charge of rebellion.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian attack involving hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles has struck Kyiv, killing at least two people and injuring sixteen. Ukrainian officials reported that wreckage from the assault hit residential buildings, a healthcare center, and other infrastructure, causing significant fires across the capital. The attack is one of the largest aerial bombardments of the war, underscoring the escalating conflict and dimming prospects for a diplomatic resolution as international leaders continue to discuss sanctions and further support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

The EU is anxiously awaiting a decision from Washington, hoping to secure a trade deal that mitigates the economic impact, making the discussions in London particularly relevant to the bloc's strategy.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is generating discussion for its depiction of the hero as a symbol of universal morality rather than purely American ideals. Gunn described the character as representing a "battered" but good America, focusing on kindness and protecting the weak globally, which has led some conservative commentators to criticize the portrayal as "woke." The article explores the history of Superman as a character created by Jewish immigrants to defend the oppressed and his modern interpretation as a figure analogous to an undocumented immigrant.</p>

Originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, this long-term political commitment has created a stable system, though challenges remain regarding accessibility for newcomers and the complexity of the allocation process.</p>

The trend is forcing the ruling Labour party to adjust its strategy, now turning its attention toward countering Reform's rise. Analysts note that Reform's sustained poll leads and recent election wins are making it a consequential force in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced spot checks at its border with Germany, a move that mirrors Germany's own controls and further strains the principle of free movement within the Schengen Area. The checks, a response to Germany's toughened migration policies, are causing significant difficulties for residents and commuters in border cities like Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder, who rely on open borders for daily life. While the Polish government frames it as a security measure, locals express frustration over the political maneuvering that disrupts their interconnected communities.</p>

          <p>An investigation is questioning how Roy Barclay, a man on Suffolk Police's most-wanted list, was able to evade capture for two years before murdering 57-year-old Anita Rose. Despite being wanted for a parole breach, Barclay lived in makeshift camps but left a significant digital footprint, including using a bank card and posting hundreds of online reviews. The case has raised serious questions about police and probation service effectiveness, as a voluntary partnership review is set to examine the information-sharing and collaboration failures that allowed a known violent offender to remain free.</p>
