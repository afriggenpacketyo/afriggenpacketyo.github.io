          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is projected to save taxpayers only $150 billion, far short of the $1 trillion initially pledged. While DOGE claimed to cut bureaucratic fat, the actual costs of firings, re-hirings, and lost productivity are estimated to be around $135 billion this fiscal year. The IRS alone faces an $8.5 billion revenue loss in 2026 due to a DOGE-driven exodus of 22,000 employees, highlighting the unforeseen financial consequences of the administration's cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is giving detained migrants as little as 12 hours to contest their deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, according to an unsealed ICE document. This timeframe allows for a brief window to file a habeas petition. The Supreme Court recently halted deportations of Venezuelan criminals under the Act, with Justices Alito and Thomas dissenting.

Transportation officials raised the possibility that the disclosure attempted to sabotage its efforts to halt congestion pricing and transferred the case to the civil division of the Justice Department in Washington.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization's online store began selling "Trump 2028" hats and T-shirts, sparking speculation about President Donald Trump's intentions to seek a third term, despite constitutional limitations. The 22nd Amendment restricts presidents from serving more than two terms. Trump has previously teased the possibility of running for a third term, acknowledging that it would require amending the Constitution. The White House referred inquiries about the apparel to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a memorandum directing the attorney general to investigate ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform, over unsubstantiated claims of foreign contributions and straw donations. ActBlue's CEO anticipated the action, stating that the organization would not be deterred. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to "cripple the left" and weaken Democratic fundraising capabilities. Republicans have previously called for investigations into ActBlue, alleging potential vulnerabilities for foreign actors to illegally participate in the U.S. political process.</p>

The move reflects a reaction to China's presence in Africa's mining sector and a recalibrated U.S. doctrine under the Trump administration, focusing on securing access to critical minerals through military means.</p>
