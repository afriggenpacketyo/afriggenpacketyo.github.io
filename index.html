          <p>A shooting at a high school in Graz, Austria, resulted in the deaths of ten people, including the suspected shooter, a 21-year-old former student who committed suicide after the attack. Austrian authorities have described the event as a national tragedy, prompting three days of national mourning. European leaders have expressed their condolences, with Germany mourning alongside Austria, and the European Commission President emphasizing the sanctity of schools. The suspect used a long gun and a handgun, both legally owned, and the motive remains unclear. Flags will be flown at half-mast, and a national minute of mourning is scheduled.

The book tells the story of Corby Ledbetter, a young father who causes a tragedy and journeys through prison, witnessing both brutality and kindness as he seeks forgiveness. Lamb shared that the book explores themes of guilt, redemption, and forgiveness, drawing from his experiences working with women in prison. Winfrey advised readers not to skip to the last page, and Lamb hopes the book conveys the message that addiction is a black hole one can escape through 12-step programs.</p>

Concerns have been raised that Kennedy may appoint members sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views, leading to politicized recommendations that deter Americans from getting vaccinated.

Members of the Trump family have launched meme coins and announced a stake in a crypto firm, reflecting a broader embrace of crypto. The Department of Labor eased guidance that made it difficult for Americans to invest 401(k) plans in crypto. Trump Media is also pivoting to crypto by creating a corporate bitcoin reserve, tying its stock price to the price of bitcoin. This alignment is seen as mutually beneficial, with Trump's policies boosting the value of crypto assets and benefiting his own enterprises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt, outlining the differences in their approaches and consequences. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into one loan with a potentially lower interest rate, simplifying repayment without reducing the principal balance. Debt forgiveness, on the other hand, involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed, typically leading to a reduction of 30% to 50% of the original balance, but it damages credit due to missed payments during negotiations. The article provides a cost comparison and highlights that while debt forgiveness can save more money upfront, the credit damage could lead to higher interest rates on future loans.

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities" in the occupied West Bank. The sanctions include a ban from entering the UK and a freeze on any UK assets. These ministers have also faced criticism for opposing aid to Gaza and advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside the territory. Israel has responded by calling the sanctions outrageous and stating that elected representatives should not be subjected to such measures. The UK's decision reflects growing international concern over violence in the West Bank and tensions between Israel and Palestine.</p>

          <p>The article provides tips on how to find the best travel bargains. The key is to adopt an “off-travel” mind-set and use off-season, off-peak, off-road and other offbeat strategies. These strategies include traveling during the off-season, exploring less popular destinations, and being flexible with travel dates and times. By employing these tactics, travelers can potentially save money and enjoy unique experiences.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has sharply reduced its global economic growth projections, citing disruption from trade uncertainty, particularly. The bank now expects the global economy to expand by 2.3% in 2025, down from an earlier forecast of 2.7%, marking the slowest rate of global growth since 2008, excluding outright recessions. Trade uncertainty has weighed heavily on the outlook, with international discord disrupting policy certainties. The World Bank also cut its 2025 growth forecast for the U.S. by 0.9 percentage points to 1.4% and reduced its euro area GDP expectations by 0.3 percentage points to 0.7%. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied that his government's decision to extend winter fuel payments to more pensioners was due to political pressure. Starmer argued that an improved economy allowed the government to reverse a previous decision to withdraw the payments from all but the poorest pensioners. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of £35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government claims that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and trade deals have made the policy change possible. (not investment advice)</p>
