          <p>A provision in President Trump's spending package, known as Section 899, is being scrutinized for its potential impact on investors. The provision would allow the U.S. to impose a tax of up to 20% on foreign entities with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" against U.S. companies. Some analysts are concerned this "revenge tax" could limit foreign investment in the U.S. and negatively affect the asset management industry. Experts are still assessing the potential consequences as the Senate reviews the bill (not investment advice).</p>

Maynard believes that regulators should ensure that the industry is held to high standards and that patrons are protected from harm.

          <p>In Vietnam, the term “Cali,” referring to the Vietnamese diaspora in California, has become a derogatory term used by nationalists to criticize those who disagree with state policy. This sentiment is fueled by a growing wave of nationalism and perceptions of American influence, leading to attacks on U.S.-backed institutions and individuals. The government's control over media and education bolsters this nationalism, making it difficult for dissenting voices to be heard.

          <p>California's coastal communities face a significant risk from near-shore tsunamis triggered by earthquakes just offshore, potentially leaving residents with as little as 10 minutes to evacuate. Data indicates that locally generated tsunamis could reach dangerous heights in areas like Marina del Rey, Long Beach, and Catalina Island. Experts emphasize the need for rapid evacuation, but acknowledge that challenges exist in densely populated areas, such as Alameda and Newport Beach. The potential for chaos during an evacuation was highlighted by a recent tsunami warning, underscoring the importance of preparedness and clear communication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive assessment of tsunami risk along the California coast reveals varying levels of potential damage and casualties depending on the source and location. Distant-source tsunamis, originating from earthquakes in Alaska or Chile, could provide hours of warning but cause widespread inundation. Near-source tsunamis, triggered by local earthquakes, could strike within minutes, leaving little time for evacuation. The report details potential casualties and billions of dollars in damage across Southern California, the Central Coast, the Bay Area, and the North Coast, underscoring the need for preparedness and awareness. The optimism score reflects the inherent danger of natural disasters and the need for preparation.</p>

          <p>Indigenous Kawésqar fishermen in Chile claim that the salmon farming industry is damaging their ancestral home and way of life. Reinaldo Caro, one of the last Kawésqar fishermen, decries the contamination of the seabed from feces and medication used in salmon farms. The industry, a major exporter, is criticized for harming Chilean ecosystems and contributing to algal blooms. Legislation is in its final stages to deem salmon farming incompatible with the Kawésqar people's traditional way of life, potentially halting the industry's expansion, but the economic impact remains a concern.</p>
