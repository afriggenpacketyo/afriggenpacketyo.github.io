        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who is currently suing to block her removal by the president. The new referral alleges misrepresentations on a mortgage application for a third property and in government ethics filings regarding her real estate holdings. This action intensifies the conflict, implicitly challenging arguments that the president lacks cause for her dismissal by focusing on conduct during her tenure at the Fed. The ongoing dispute highlights significant political pressure being applied to the central bank's leadership over its policies and personnel.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is poised to deliver a verdict on Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra's future, following accusations of ethical misconduct related to a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen. The case, brought by senators, alleges she undermined the nation's military and acted dishonestly, threatening to remove her from office after just one year. A ruling against her could leave the country leaderless and plunge it into political turmoil, especially as it navigates a fragile ceasefire with Cambodia after recent deadly border clashes. This situation underscores the deep-seated political divisions involving the military, royalist elites, and the Shinawatra dynasty.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has experienced a period of significant upheaval, marked by mass layoffs, high-profile resignations, and major shifts in vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A detailed timeline chronicles events from late 2024, including the controversial nomination processes for a new director, the departure of key scientific officials, and the reconstitution of the vaccine advisory panel with vaccine-skeptic members. The turmoil culminated in the recent attempted ousting of Director Susan Monarez, which prompted further resignations from senior staff who cited the weaponization of public health and political interference in scientific processes.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have filed a motion asking a Tennessee court to prohibit all Department of Justice and Homeland Security officials from making inflammatory public statements about their client. They argue that numerous high-level officials, including the president who called Abrego Garcia an "animal," have made prejudicial and false claims that jeopardize his right to a fair trial. The filing asserts that these extrajudicial comments have continued despite a previous court order and risk tainting any potential jury pool. Abrego Garcia, who was deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges, denies all allegations, including purported gang membership.</p>

The couple was arrested on suspicion of possessing illegal weapons but have since been released without charges. Authorities are also investigating the 2017 disappearance of another man associated with the Hemet-based group.</p>

          <p>TikTok creator Emilie Kiser has broken her silence regarding the drowning death of her three-year-old son, Trigg, who fell into the family's pool in May. In an emotional statement, Kiser took accountability for the tragedy, expressing deep regret and acknowledging that a permanent pool fence could have prevented it. The incident occurred while the boy's father was watching him and was momentarily distracted. Kiser, a prominent "mom influencer," also announced she will establish stricter boundaries on what she shares online to protect her family's privacy. Prosecutors declined to press charges against her husband, citing insufficient evidence for a conviction.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that the attacker who opened fire on a Minneapolis church school, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children." The 23-year-old shooter, a former student at the school, reportedly expressed hatred towards multiple groups and President Trump in notes but did not appear to have a specific motive beyond a desire to kill children and gain notoriety. The victims were identified as eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski. Officials described the attack as an act of domestic terrorism, noting the shooter's deranged fascination with previous mass shootings before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>

          <p>According to internal Taiwanese government research, China's spending on military exercises in the Pacific region surged by nearly 40% in the last year, reaching an estimated $21 billion. The analysis, based on tracking Chinese naval and air missions, suggests this expenditure accounts for about 9% of China's official defense budget, which many diplomats believe is under-reported. The report details a significant increase in activity, with nearly 12,000 aircraft flights and over 86,000 naval sailings, as Beijing works to normalize its military presence around the First Island Chain. This escalation is raising concerns about regional stability in Taipei and Washington.</p>

While experts don't foresee a long-lasting friendship, the talks signal a willingness to find common ground, driven by India's heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains for key industries like pharmaceuticals and electric vehicles.

The decision by Judge Sheryl Lipman was based on concerns of potential juror bias after the original presiding judge, Mark S.

The three officers—Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr.—were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols's civil rights by causing his death.

Ancient oaks are crucial ecological keystones, supporting over 2,300 species and playing a central role in nature recovery efforts across the UK.</p>

          <p>For 42 of its 75 years on the air, host Bev Johnson has been a cornerstone of WDIA in Memphis, America's first all-Black radio station. Since its pivot to Black-focused programming in 1948, WDIA has served as a vital source of music, news, and community information that was often ignored by mainstream media, including stories on civil rights and police brutality. The station played a key role in preserving the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum. Johnson continues this legacy, providing listeners with critical information and a connection to their community.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered an international network of spammers using Facebook to post low-quality, AI-generated images depicting fabricated scenes from the Holocaust, a practice known as "AI slop." These creators, many based in Pakistan, are exploiting Meta's content monetization program, which rewards high-engagement posts, to profit from the emotionally charged, fictional narratives. Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice, stating it distresses survivors, disrespects victims, and dangerously distorts history. The investigation found that the spammers operate sophisticated networks, often impersonating other entities to build audiences before posting the fabricated historical content.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, the NHS will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales, a move aimed at preventing severe illness and reducing the economic burden on working parents. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope the program will dramatically reduce cases of the highly contagious varicella virus, which, though usually mild, can lead to serious complications like encephalitis and stroke.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a board-approved plan to display Israeli flags on school campuses for Jewish American Heritage Month, citing heightened safety concerns. The Board of Education had narrowly voted 3-to-2 in favor of the display as part of a resolution to combat antisemitism. However, the decision sparked controversy, with critics arguing it inappropriately equated support for the Jewish community with endorsement of the Israeli state's actions. Citing his executive authority to protect students, Superintendent Alex Cherniss mandated that only U.S. and California state flags will be displayed until further notice.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis for a major reorganization of English councils, instead relying on third-party estimates that have since been revised, a BBC investigation found. The local government ministry based its claim of significant savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN), which projected £2.9 billion in savings over five years. However, the CCN's updated analysis suggests the mergers could actually cost money and deliver no savings under certain scenarios, such as creating multiple smaller authorities. Critics argue it is astonishing to embark on such a large-scale reform without independent, up-to-date evidence.</p>

The bombardment, one of the largest on the capital this month, destroyed a residential building and drew strong condemnation from across Europe.

While officials defend the bill as a measure to protect national security, opponents, including community activists and state representatives, condemn it as discriminatory and anti-immigrant. The law has sparked a legal challenge and created fear and uncertainty within the Chinese-American community, drawing comparisons to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. Critics argue the law unfairly equates individuals with their governments and could harm the state's economy by deterring foreign investment.</p>

Although the captured female fish was sterile, its presence is alarming because grass carp can consume up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native species. This is only the third grass carp found in Canadian waters since 2013, but natural reproduction has already begun in U.S. rivers connected to Lake Erie.
