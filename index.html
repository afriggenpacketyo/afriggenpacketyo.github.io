          <p>Beijing is preparing for a major military parade on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which will showcase the People's Liberation Army's most advanced weaponry. While the event's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe the display of military might, including new carrier-based fighter jets and intercontinental ballistic missiles, is intended to send a strong signal to the self-ruled island. Recent deployments of Chinese aircraft carriers near Taiwan have already heightened regional tensions, with the parade expected to further underscore China's military readiness and foreign policy direction under President Xi Jinping.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary in The Guardian explores the significant gap in French cinema regarding the nation's history with colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade. The author notes that French audiences often learn about slavery through American films, as domestic productions on the subject are rare and marginalized. The article highlights recent independent films like "Fanon" and "No Chains No Masters" that are beginning to tackle these topics, suggesting that while filmmakers and audiences are ready to confront this past, the mainstream French film industry remains hesitant to give these stories a prominent platform.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since last November, with recent data showing significant gains in the second quarter of the year. Analysts, such as those at Goldman Sachs, attribute this trend to China's resilient economic data and growing investor concerns over the sustainability of US government debt. Projections suggest the yuan will continue to appreciate, potentially breaking the 7 per dollar mark within six months. This outlook is bolstered by a shift in sentiment among onshore clients who are now less bearish on China's near-term growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance for nations, particularly in emerging economies, to develop 'sovereign AI' to maintain strategic autonomy. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and cultures, rather than relying on English-centric models from major tech companies. Experts suggest that leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize the technology and empower regions like Southeast Asia to build their own AI ecosystems. This approach fosters local talent and ensures that the economic and cultural benefits of AI are more inclusively distributed.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which registered 50.4. This reading contrasts with the official government PMI that showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a divergence attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage. The Caixin survey's positive result was driven by a surge in production, though new export orders continued to decline, signaling potential future headwinds. Despite the growth, businesses expressed weakened optimism due to fierce market competition and insufficient domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and halted trade talks, Canada announced it would scrap the 3% tax, which was set to affect companies like Amazon, Meta, and Google. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the reversal as a "big victory" for American companies, while Carney stated the decision was part of a broader negotiation as trade talks between the two nations resumed.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning 200 of the 4,000 California National Guard members currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The deployment, ordered by President Trump to address protests against ICE, has been controversial and legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom, who warned it could impede wildfire response. With an active fire season expected, the potential shift in troop allocation highlights the tension between federal priorities and state needs, as California's firefighting forces are reportedly understaffed due to the ongoing Los Angeles mission.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina family is expressing deep concern over proposed federal Medicaid cuts, which they fear could force them to ration essential treatments for their 6-year-old daughter, Kennedy. Kennedy has Noonan syndrome, a genetic condition requiring extensive therapy that is largely covered by a state Medicaid waiver program. Her family states that without this coverage, their monthly medical expenses would exceed $4,000. They are among 600,000 North Carolinians who could lose healthcare access if the cuts, part of a bill advancing in Congress, are enacted, potentially forcing the state to eliminate vital programs like the one the family relies on.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly the tightening of eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaged in a major persuasion effort to win over dozens of dissenting Labour MPs. Critics within the party argue that the changes are being rushed to meet fiscal targets and that a planned review will conclude too late to influence the new criteria. The looming vote is seen as a major test of party unity and the government's direction on social policy.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a key mechanism explaining the anti-aging effects of long-term exercise. Their research, published in the journal Cell, found that a naturally occurring compound called betaine is produced in the kidneys during exercise and acts as a crucial messenger. Betaine was observed to slow the aging of multiple organs by targeting and inhibiting an enzyme associated with inflammation. These findings not only provide a deeper understanding of the molecular link between exercise and longevity but also suggest potential anti-aging strategies that could simulate the benefits of physical activity.</p>

          <p>The 20-year-old man who fatally ambushed firefighters in Idaho had once aspired to be a firefighter himself, according to law enforcement and family. Wess Roley killed two firefighters, Frank Harwood and John Morrison, and injured a third after deliberately starting a fire to lure them to a remote area. The suspect's grandfather stated that his grandson respected law enforcement and had applied for a job with a fire department, making the motive for the attack deeply perplexing. Sheriff Bob Norris confirmed the attack was a deliberate ambush, which ended when Roley was found deceased from an apparent self-inflicted wound.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made early moves in NBA free agency, losing a key defensive player but quickly signing a new forward. Dorian Finney-Smith, a versatile defender, opted out of his contract with the Lakers and agreed to a four-year, $53-million deal with the Houston Rockets. In response, the Lakers secured forward Jake LaRavia on a two-year, $12-million contract. LaRavia, who played for Memphis and Sacramento last season, is expected to provide wing depth and outside shooting, having shot over 42% from three-point range during the previous season.</p>
