          <p>A new US-led peace plan for Gaza proposes an international "Board of Peace" to oversee the territory's transitional governance, chaired by President Donald Trump. Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is the first named member of this board, which would supervise a technocratic Palestinian committee responsible for daily administration. The 20-point plan aims to end the conflict by demilitarizing Gaza and securing the return of all hostages. Blair has endorsed the proposal as the best opportunity to end the war while ensuring Israel's security.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's Communities Minister, Gordon Lyons, has stated that a severe housing shortage is fueling racial tensions across the region. He explained that while racism is inexcusable, community concerns are growing as local residents wait years for social housing while asylum seekers are accommodated in their areas. The issue is concentrated in deprived areas where housing is cheaper, exacerbating existing pressures. Lyons is proposing to use surplus public sector land to build more social homes to address the crisis, as current funding falls far short of government targets.</p>

The aide worked for Krah between 2019 and 2024 and has been sentenced to four years and nine months in prison. Krah, who testified as a witness, denied any knowledge of his aide's activities.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has accused U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of "harassing people for not being white" during recent operations in Chicago. The governor's comments came in response to the Trump administration's deployment of federal agents to the city, which has a sanctuary ordinance limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Pritzker criticized the operations, stating that a majority of individuals detained by ICE in Illinois this year have no criminal convictions. The actions are part of the Trump administration's broader goal to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a prison sentence of more than 11 years for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on prostitution-related charges. They argue the lengthy term is warranted due to the seriousness of his crimes, which involved violence and instilling fear in his victims. In their sentencing recommendation, prosecutors included letters from accusers, including singer Cassie Ventura, who described living in fear of retribution. Combs was convicted in July for arranging paid sexual encounters for his girlfriends, a violation of the Mann Act.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government faces a potential shutdown as funding is set to expire, pending a spending bill agreement between Republicans and Democrats. The impasse centers on Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits and reverse Medicaid cuts, which Republicans have so far rejected. If no deal is reached by the deadline, many non-essential government services, such as national park operations and food assistance programs, could be halted. This standoff is particularly tense as the Trump administration has indicated it may use a shutdown to permanently reduce the federal workforce.</p>

This meeting comes as public satisfaction with the ruling conservative-Social Democrat coalition has fallen to a record low.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump administration is urging Taiwan to shift semiconductor production to the U.S., with the goal of manufacturing half of America's chips domestically. This "50-50" plan aims to reduce significant US dependence on Taiwan, which currently produces over 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Lutnick argued that a more balanced production would enhance Taiwan's security, countering the "Silicon Shield" theory that its chip dominance deters a Chinese invasion. The administration hopes to reach 40% domestic production by the end of the current presidential term.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, citing ongoing concerns about inflation, which is at its highest level in over a year. The decision was widely expected by economists and follows a report showing the headline inflation rate reached 3% in August. In its statement, the RBA noted that inflation in the September quarter might be higher than previously forecast and signaled that private demand was recovering. The bank has cut rates by 75 basis points this year to combat rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.8 in September, marking the sixth straight month of contraction but exceeding economists' expectations. The reading, the strongest since March, suggests that Beijing's efforts to curb industrial overcapacity may be having an effect amid weak domestic and global demand. A separate private survey from RatingDog painted a more optimistic picture, showing expansion at 51.2, driven by a rise in new orders. Despite the slight improvement, the data underscores ongoing economic challenges for the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Northern California woman who was knocked unconscious during a violent arrest by two sheriff's deputies in 2020 has secured a $17 million settlement from Solano County. Nakia Porter, a Black woman, had pulled over with her family to switch drivers when the deputies confronted her, ultimately slamming her to the ground. Body camera footage captured the incident, where Porter was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest but was never charged. Her federal lawsuit accused the deputies of excessive force and lying in their reports, leading to the substantial settlement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent decline in support for diversity and inclusion initiatives within Germany's cultural institutions is not a sign of fatigue but a deliberate political strategy. It suggests that a push for a supposed "neutrality" is masking a reactionary movement to restore a white, Eurocentric status quo. The author notes that while there was a brief period of progress following movements like Black Lives Matter, diversity programs are now being defunded amid austerity. This shift is being amplified by the far-right AfD party, which frames diversity as "ideological indoctrination."</p>

          <p>Leading grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the discount models of European chains like Aldi and Lidl. Amid an economic slowdown, these companies are streamlining their hypermarkets and heavily promoting their own private-label brands to appeal to frugal shoppers. This strategy involves offering products of comparable quality to name brands at lower prices by cutting out intermediaries and reducing marketing costs. The shift comes as sales at top Chinese grocery operators have stagnated and consumer behavior becomes more value-driven.</p>
