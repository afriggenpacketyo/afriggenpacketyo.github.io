        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of over €3,200 per month, a sum far exceeding the average pension and creating immense financial strain for seniors and their families. With an aging population and rising wages for care staff contributing to the increase, many residents now depend on welfare to cover expenses. Health officials and economists are urgently calling for fundamental reforms to the nation's long-term care insurance system, proposing solutions like increased tax subsidies or higher contributions from top earners to prevent its imminent collapse.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest after being convicted of witness tampering and bribery. The case centered on allegations that Uribe attempted to influence imprisoned former paramilitary members to change their testimony linking him to paramilitary groups in the 1990s. The 73-year-old conservative icon, who denies the charges and plans to appeal, is a deeply polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country and condemned by others for human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from special counsel John Durham's report has further weakened claims by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard of a high-level conspiracy to undermine Donald Trump in 2016. The document confirms that emails, which Trump supporters believed showed a plot by Hillary Clinton's campaign, were actually fabricated by Russian intelligence from hacked materials. This finding contradicts the narrative of a "deep state" plot and aligns with previous intelligence assessments, complicating efforts to portray the Russia investigation as a purely political fabrication by Obama-era officials.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a 4% year-over-year dip in its second-quarter operating earnings, falling to $11.16 billion. The decline was primarily driven by weaker insurance underwriting results, though profits from its railroad, energy, and retail businesses saw increases. The conglomerate issued a strong warning about the potential negative consequences of U.S. trade tariffs on its diverse operations and investments, while its massive cash pile remained near a record high at $344.1 billion, and the company refrained from any stock buybacks in the first half of the year.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to reopen Alcatraz as a detention facility has been met with strong condemnation from Indigenous leaders, who view it as an attempt to erase the island's pivotal role in Native American history. After the federal prison closed in 1963, Alcatraz became the site of a 19-month occupation by Indigenous activists, a seminal event in the modern Native rights movement that led to significant policy changes. Tribal leaders argue that using the site for Trump's anti-immigrant agenda is retraumatizing and ignores its legacy as a symbol of Indigenous resistance and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old man from Long Beach, California, has been arrested on federal charges for allegedly sending money to and expressing support for the terrorist group ISIS. Prosecutors claim Mark Lorenzo Villanueva communicated with self-identified ISIS fighters online, pledged allegiance, and sent over $1,600 to intermediaries to support the group's resources. Upon his arrest, the FBI reportedly recovered what appeared to be a bomb from his bedroom. Villanueva is charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Following NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders' recent surgery for bladder cancer, medical experts are explaining the complex neobladder reconstruction procedure he underwent. The surgery involves removing the patient's bladder and creating a new one from a segment of their own small intestine, which is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. While the procedure allows for urination, it requires retraining as the new organ cannot signal the brain when it is full. Sanders has been praised for openly discussing the challenges, including incontinence, to reduce stigma for others.</p>

          <p>Russia has maintained an official silence in response to President Trump's announcement that he ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia, a move triggered by a social media spat with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Russian news outlets and military commentators have been largely dismissive, with some calling the move a "temper tantrum" and suggesting it is not a genuine military escalation. The lack of an official reaction from the Kremlin suggests Moscow may not view the deployment as a serious threat, possibly seeing it as part of Trump's unpredictable political style.</p>

          <p>In an interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor argues that humanity's survival depends on moving beyond an individualistic, human-centric worldview that has dominated since Descartes. He contends that our current crises, from climate change to the risks of AI, stem from the illusion that humans are separate from nature. Taylor proposes a new understanding of the self as a node in a vast, interconnected web of information, urging a recognition of relationality and alternative intelligences in the natural world to foster a necessary "love of world" and defy a nihilistic, technology-driven escapism.</p>

          <p>An investigation into a major air battle between Pakistan and India reveals that an Indian intelligence failure was central to the downing of a cutting-edge Indian Rafale fighter jet. Indian pilots reportedly believed they were outside the 150 km range of the Chinese-made PL-15 missiles fired by Pakistani J-10C jets, but the missiles were effective from around 200 km away. The incident, which surprised military observers, highlighted the capability of Chinese weaponry and the critical importance of accurate intelligence and integrated "kill chain" networks in modern aerial warfare.</p>
