Health officials in Gaza had reported that up to 31 people were killed by IDF fire.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick minimized the impact of legal uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs on negotiations with the European Union. He dismissed claims that the EU gained leverage due to the court ruling, emphasizing President Trump's ability to protect American workers. A U.S. trade court initially blocked Trump's tariffs, but an appeals court paused that ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect while the appeal is considered. Lutnick stated that the ruling only caused a minor delay in negotiations, and discussions are ongoing. (not investment advice)</p>
