          <p>Lenders for Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, have submitted a rescue plan to prevent its collapse, proposing to write off a third of its nearly £20bn debt and inject £5.4bn for service improvements. This initiative aims to rebuild the company without taxpayer funding, addressing years of criticism over sewage discharges and pipe leaks. The plan seeks quick agreement with the regulator, Ofwat, to stabilize the firm, which serves a quarter of the UK population. The company remains "extremely stressed," with a decade-long turnaround anticipated.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda hit Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing heavy rain and powerful winds before weakening to Category 1 and moving further into the Atlantic. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, with the storm expected to become extratropical. Despite hurricane-force winds, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or flash flooding in Bermuda. Swells from Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are spreading to the U.S. East Coast, posing rip current risks.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has successfully concluded a $6.6 billion secondary share sale, valuing the company at a record $500 billion and allowing current and former employees to sell stock. This transaction, involving investors like Thrive Capital and SoftBank, saw two-thirds of the authorized shares change hands, indicating strong investor confidence despite the high valuation. The deal reinforces OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX.

          <p>Chinese researchers are deploying and training robotic dogs in a lava tube cave, strikingly similar to the moon's underground environment, to prepare for future lunar exploration. These robot scouts are designed to navigate narrow sections and execute surveying tasks in areas inaccessible to humans. The testing aims to advance embodied intelligence technologies crucial for deep-space missions, particularly for identifying ideal locations for human lunar bases. This innovative approach signifies a significant step in China's ambitious space program.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit against Nirvana, alleging child pornography over the "Nevermind" album cover featuring Spencer Elden as a naked baby, has been dismissed for a second time by a federal judge. Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the image pornographic, likening it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." Elden's legal team had argued for ongoing personal harm, but the judge rejected this, stating it would allow indefinite lawsuits. The article notes Nirvana's lawyer expressed delight at the dismissal of the "meritless case."</p>
