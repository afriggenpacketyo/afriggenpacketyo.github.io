            <p>Thousands of protesters gathered across the United States to demonstrate against President Trump's administration, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the American Revolutionary War. Demonstrations took place outside the White House, at Tesla dealerships, and during Revolutionary War commemorations, with protesters voicing concerns over government downsizing, immigration policies, and perceived threats to democratic ideals. Protesters carried signs referencing the revolution, while speakers voiced concerns about executive overreach and the erosion of constitutional rights. Recent polling data suggests a slight dip in Trump's approval ratings, particularly regarding his handling of the economy.</p>

            <p>The death toll from attacks in Nigeria's Benue state has risen to 56, with the governor blaming suspected herdsmen for the violence. These attacks are part of a larger pattern of intercommunal violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt, often involving clashes between nomadic herders and settled farmers over land use. Climate change exacerbates the issue, driving herders south in search of grazing lands, leading to deadly disputes. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to protect communities from these attacks.</p>

The bill aims to remove the remaining 87 hereditary peers, following a previous reform in 1999 that removed most of them. Some hereditary peers argue that they offer a long-term perspective, while others believe their presence is anachronistic.</p>

The gang's influence spread beyond the prison walls, impacting the lives of residents in the surrounding town and contributing to Venezuela's migration crisis.

Consumer advocates argue that this is an attempt by the industry to push high-risk homeowners to lower benefit policies while collecting higher premiums from others. The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed due to increasing wildfires and policy cancellations by private insurers.</p>

            <p>Roki Sasaki delivered a solid six-inning performance for the Dodgers, but the bullpen faltered, resulting in a walk-off loss to the Texas Rangers. Despite a drop in fastball velocity, Sasaki used his secondary pitches effectively to limit the Rangers to two runs. The Dodgers' offense rallied to take the lead, but Kirby Yates gave up a walk-off home run in the ninth inning. The loss highlighted the absence of Blake Treinen, who was placed on the injured list with forearm tightness.</p>

            <p>An Indonesian student, Aditya Wahyu Harsono, was detained by ICE after his U.S. visa was secretly revoked.

Harsono, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a child with special needs, was arrested at his workplace.

However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of breaking the truce, stating that attacks were ongoing.

Previous attempts at ceasefires have failed due to a lack of agreement between both sides.</p>
