          <p>A male lion named Zeus escaped from the Land of Lions zoo in Manavgat, Turkey, and seriously injured a 53-year-old farmer. The man was sleeping outdoors when the lion attacked, leading to a struggle before police scared the animal away by firing shots into the air. The farmer was hospitalized with wounds to his head, shoulder, and legs. Authorities later located the escaped lion in a nearby wooded area and killed it, prompting an investigation into how the animal managed to escape its enclosure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has become the first country to officially recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move the Taliban's foreign minister hailed as the start of a new phase of positive relations. Analysts suggest Russia's decision is driven by economic interests, including the potential for Afghanistan to become a trade hub and a route for a gas pipeline to Pakistan and India. The recognition puts political pressure on Western nations and has raised alarms among human rights activists, who fear it validates the Taliban's oppressive policies, particularly against women and girls.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, celebrating the 56 signers who committed treason against the British Empire to establish a new nation. It highlights the revolutionary nature of the Declaration's principles, such as equality and unalienable rights, which were radical concepts in a world dominated by monarchies. The author argues that this "revolution against history" ultimately succeeded, reshaping the globe by promoting democracy, freedom, and prosperity, and calls for a continued commitment to these foundational ideals.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League is uncertain due to the complex business dealings of its largest shareholder, John Textor. The club's participation hinges on the outcome of an appeal by French club Lyon, also owned by Textor's company, against their relegation. UEFA rules prevent two clubs with the same influential owner from competing in the same tournament. This situation is further complicated by Textor's strained relationships with football authorities and his impending sale of his Palace shares to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson.</p>

          <p>Critics are warning of an unprecedented expansion of presidential power under Donald Trump, who has taken numerous unilateral actions in his second term. These include ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, imposing tariffs via national emergency declarations, and deploying the National Guard against a state governor's wishes. While some supporters see these actions as necessary, analysts express concern that longstanding checks and balances from Congress and the judiciary are proving ineffective. This trend, building on actions by previous presidents, is seen as a deliberate strategy to eliminate limits on executive authority.</p>

The author describes it as a unique space where the lines between real and unreal are constantly blurred, creating a powerful spectacle with archetypal characters and narratives. The article also references the book "Say Hello to the Bad Guys," using Hulk Hogan's famous 1996 heel turn as an example of wrestling's ability to create potent, reality-bending storylines.

          <p>Five months into Donald Trump's second term, the U.S. economy has defied both the president's promises of a "golden age" and critics' predictions of a catastrophe. Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have remained relatively stable, with modest growth continuing, leading to an economy best described as "okay." The article suggests that while Trump's policies, such as tariffs and deregulation, have created uncertainty, they have not been significant enough to cause a major shift. However, this "okay" economy may not satisfy voters who remain unhappy with their financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings" has become a box-office success, but this article argues it struggles to transcend the niche of "Christian movies." Based on a Charles Dickens book, the film aims for mainstream appeal with a star-studded cast and by framing the story of Jesus through a historical lens. However, the author finds its on-the-nose messaging and lack of nuanced character development may fail to engage non-believing audiences. The article contrasts it with more successful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt," suggesting that artful storytelling is key to reaching beyond the faithful.</p>

          <p>A recent mayoral primary victory in New York City is fueling speculation that the Democratic Party may be on the verge of a grassroots takeover, similar to the Tea Party movement's impact on the GOP. This potential shift is driven by a populist, progressive energy among the party's base, which is increasingly frustrated with current leadership and demands a stronger focus on working-class economic issues. While the movement currently lacks a unified list of priorities, there is a clear desire for new leadership and a more combative, left-leaning policy agenda, which could lead to more primary challenges against incumbent Democrats.</p>

          <p>A report from the research services of the German parliament, the Bundestag, has expressed "substantial doubt" about the legal justification for recent Israeli and US strikes on Iran. The report, requested by a Left Party lawmaker, concluded that most international law experts believe the criteria for self-defense under the UN Charter were not met. To justify the strikes, Israel would have needed to prove an imminent threat of a nuclear attack from Iran, not just the possession of nuclear material. The findings contrast with the German government's outspoken support for the military action.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the Republican party are intensifying efforts to eliminate grace periods for mail-in ballots, pushing for a strict Election Day receipt deadline. A recent executive order and several GOP-backed lawsuits argue that federal law establishes a single Election Day, making the counting of late-arriving ballots illegitimate, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. At least three states have already passed laws to this effect. This push is closely tied to unsubstantiated claims of a rigged 2020 election and a desire for immediate election night results.</p>

          <p>A CDC advisory committee is considering recommending that flu shots be made without thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been a target of anti-vaccine groups. This move comes despite numerous scientific studies and a long history of safe use showing no link between thimerosal and autism or other health problems. The preservative was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001 as a precaution, and today 94% of flu shots are already thimerosal-free. Critics of the committee's focus argue it is solving a non-existent problem and could undermine public confidence in vaccines.</p>

          <p>Mark Rowley, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, has called for a major overhaul of policing in England and Wales, which he says is not fit for purpose. He proposes consolidating the current 43 separate police forces into 12 to 15 larger, regional "mega" forces. Rowley argues this would make better use of limited funding, improve the ability to tackle modern threats like organized crime, and allow for better investment in technology. The call for reform comes as UK police forces grapple with years of austerity and falling public confidence.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that a recent government U-turn on a package of welfare reforms has made future spending decisions more challenging. The reversal, forced by a rebellion of Labour MPs, means billions in expected savings will be lost, putting pressure on the budget. Consequently, Phillipson did not commit to scrapping the controversial two-child benefit cap, a policy estimated to lift 500,000 children out of poverty if removed. She noted that while the cap is an important consideration, its removal comes at a significant cost.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out "Best Start" family hubs across every local authority in England by 2026. These hubs aim to provide a "lifeline" to families by offering a wide range of services, from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative builds on a previous Conservative program and is reminiscent of Labour's earlier "Sure Start" centers. The government's stated mission is to improve life chances for children in disadvantaged areas by making support services more accessible.</p>

The men, convicted of serious crimes, were sent to the third-party country after a Supreme Court ruling overturned a lower court's block on the deportation. Notably, only one of the eight men is a South Sudanese national, with the others being from countries that refused to accept them.

          <p>This analysis explores the reasons behind the silence of American evangelicals as the Trump administration dismantles PEPFAR, the highly successful AIDS relief program they once championed. The author suggests a combination of factors, including ignorance of the program's impact, compassion fatigue, and a deep-seated fealty to Donald Trump that overrides other concerns. Many pastors also fear alienating their congregations by engaging in what is perceived as political criticism. This inaction stands in stark contrast to the movement's vocal stance on other culture war issues, revealing a significant shift in priorities.</p>

The agency actively recruits individuals with creative skills, from makeup artists to storytellers, and has historically relied on Hollywood talent for missions like the "Argo" rescue. In return, the CIA assists filmmakers and authors to ensure accuracy in their portrayals, which can help shape public perception and inspire a new generation of recruits.

Researchers warn the cuts will halt ongoing projects, stop clinical trials, and devastate the careers of the next generation of scientists, potentially triggering a "brain drain" to other countries. The administration has justified the cuts by accusing the NIH of wasteful spending, but scientists argue that long-term federal investment is essential for medical breakthroughs. Thousands of grants are already affected, leaving the future of US leadership in biomedical innovation in jeopardy.</p>
