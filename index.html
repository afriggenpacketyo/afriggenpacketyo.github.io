          <p>A former fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into an art gallery called the Cookie Factory, founded by Amanda Precourt. The space, which opened in May and is free to the public, aims to promote mental wellness through art and community engagement. The inaugural exhibition features work by artist Sam Falls, created in Colorado's Yampa River Valley, and is titled "Nothing without nature." Precourt hopes the Cookie Factory will be seen as a gift to the city, fostering discussion and connection through art. The current exhibit will run through September before switching to a new artist.</p>

          <p>The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, has criticized the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), calling it dangerous and ineffective, while the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reports numerous deaths near GHF sites. Lazzarini insists humanitarian principles must be upheld, allowing experienced organizations like UNRWA to provide aid with dignity. GHF defends its operations, claiming to adhere to safety protocols and accusing the Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry of spreading false information. The controversy comes amid ongoing conflict and dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where UNRWA faces funding challenges and accusations of ties to terrorism. With global attention shifting, Lazzarini stresses the urgent need for a political solution and continued support for Palestinian refugees.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are proposing legislation that would require the U.S. Postal Service to sell its new electric vehicle mail trucks and cancel the contract for remaining deliveries. The bill aims to cut costs and shift the USPS away from environmental initiatives promoted by the Biden administration. However, USPS officials argue that selling the EVs would cost more than replacing them and would cripple the agency's ability to modernize its aging fleet. The Senate parliamentarian has found that the provision violates the Byrd Rule, and legal action forced the USPS to reconsider its original plan to purchase mostly gas-powered vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The conflict in the Middle East has caused many maritime insurance underwriters to avoid offering coverage to vessels with perceived U.S., U.K., or Israeli links, regardless of the price. Insurance rates for vessels that are covered have surged, with underwriters shortening the required notification period from 48 to 24 hours due to market volatility. Concerns about Iran potentially blocking ships and China's appetite for Iranian oil are influencing the insurance market. Despite a tentative ceasefire, nervousness remains high, and some shipowners are hesitant to book voyages to the region given the current military situation. The situation remains fluid as underwriters monitor political developments.</p>

          <p>ICE is arresting an increasing number of immigrants without criminal histories, contradicting claims that the agency prioritizes pursuing criminals. Data shows a significant increase in detainees with no criminal record since the start of Trump's second term. Nearly a third of those arrested by ICE and booked into detention had no criminal history. Despite officials' claims of targeting "criminal illegal aliens," the administration has broadened its scope to include those with no criminal record. The data suggests the current number of immigrants detained by ICE is the highest in history, leading to overcrowded facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions have limited the ability of individuals to sue federal law enforcement officers for violating their constitutional rights, potentially emboldening misconduct by agencies like ICE. The rulings in *HernÃ¡ndez v. Mesa* and *Egbert v. Boule* have weakened the *Bivens* precedent, which previously allowed individuals to seek damages for Fourth Amendment violations by federal agents. The court's conservative majority has argued that such remedies should come from Congress, not the courts. This shift could leave individuals with limited recourse when their rights are violated by federal officers, especially in the context of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is holding a record number of approximately 59,000 detainees, nearly half of whom lack a criminal record. This surge in detentions reflects the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement efforts. The current detention level is a 50% increase from the end of the Biden administration, driven by ICE arrests within the U.S. rather than border crossings. Experts are concerned about deteriorating conditions in ICE detention facilities due to overcrowding and the administration's approach to due process.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains the historical significance of Juneteenth, the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned of their freedom. Juneteenth marks a celebration of freedom and identity for African Americans, connecting their African heritage with their American experience. Baltimore, with its large free Black population before the Civil War, held early Juneteenth parades. Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, such as visiting a museum to understand the lived experience of freedom and the sacrifices made for it. Learning about the history behind Juneteenth helps us understand collective ancestry and sacrifice, as well as appreciate the opportunities we have today.</p>

          <p>Many taxpayers make avoidable mistakes when dealing with tax debt, leading to costly penalties and legal trouble. Common errors include assuming small debts don't matter, ignoring IRS letters, and thinking debts must be paid all at once. The IRS offers various payment options, such as installment agreements and Offers in Compromise, for those facing financial hardship. It is crucial to file returns on time, even without payment, to avoid steeper penalties and cooperate with the IRS. Hiring qualified professionals and understanding the limitations of bankruptcy are also important for managing tax debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from the late 2000s, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic for a generation that saw the advertisement on TV. The campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to shape public discourse against using the phrase "that's so gay." The ad, which likened using the word "gay" negatively to offensive stereotypes, has been credited with making inroads on curbing the term's use. It is considered both humorous and over-the-top, while also spotlighting a pervasive issue in a memorable fashion, and the ad can act as a success story for advancing social issues through media messaging.</p>

The situation presents opportunities for the U.S. and Israel to strengthen regional alliances and reduce proliferation risks. The conflict has highlighted the limitations of Russia and China in supporting Iran. Netanyahu could potentially secure his legacy and address demographic challenges, while Trump has the chance to reshape the Middle East.</p>
