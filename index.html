            <p>The Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Centre's Tien Kung Ultra robot won China's first half marathon for humanoid robots, propelling the state-backed center into the spotlight. The center aims to create core hardware and software platforms for humanoid robots, similar to Google's Android operating system. Their new general-purpose AI platform, Hui Si Kai Wu, can operate various robots for tasks like industrial sorting and building blocks. The goal is to establish a universal system widely used in humanoid robotics, fostering innovation and standardization in the field.</p>

            <p>Chief Judge James Boasberg found probable cause that Trump administration officials defied a court order to halt deportations, potentially leading to criminal contempt charges. The administration allegedly deported individuals to El Salvador, even after being ordered to stop, placing them in a dangerous prison. The article explores the potential consequences for these officials, including fines, imprisonment after Trump leaves office, or disbarment for involved lawyers. However, enforcement of any verdict would likely be impossible while Trump is in office, raising concerns about the judiciary's ability to enforce its rulings against the executive branch.</p>

            <p>The article criticizes the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act), arguing it would disproportionately disenfranchise women and immigrants by requiring documentation that is often difficult to obtain. It highlights the cognitive dissonance of politicians like Rep. Elise Stefanik, who sponsored legislation commemorating suffragists while also supporting the SAVE Act. The author argues that requiring passports or birth certificates with matching photo IDs to vote is a thinly veiled attempt to suppress voting, particularly among women who often change their names after marriage or divorce, and those affected by natural disasters who may have lost important documents.</p>

            <p>American consumers face higher chocolate prices this Easter due to soaring cocoa costs and President Trump's tariffs on imports. Climate-related crises in West Africa have decimated cocoa production, leading to a significant cocoa deficit and skyrocketing prices. Trump's tariffs are expected to further increase chocolate prices, as most cocoa is imported since it can only be grown in tropical climates. This combination of factors creates an unstable environment for chocolate businesses, particularly smaller ones, which lack the resources to navigate these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The US bond market has experienced unusual volatility following President Trump's trade tariff announcements, raising concerns about investor confidence in the US economy. Investors typically view government bonds as a safe haven, but uncertainty over the impact of tariffs has led to a sell-off, driving up interest rates. This can affect ordinary Americans through higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans. The bond market reaction has drawn comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, highlighting the potential for trade policies to destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's immigration policies are inspired by the repressive tactics of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. It highlights the connection between the two states' penal systems, with the US deporting migrants to El Salvador's mega-prison. The author claims that both leaders use authoritarian tactics to address social issues, creating a culture of fear and undermining the rule of law. The article also criticizes the outsourcing of immigration enforcement to private companies and foreign entities, potentially shielding it from judicial oversight.</p>
