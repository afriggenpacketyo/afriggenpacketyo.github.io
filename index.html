          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced he is reducing the 50-day deadline he previously set for Russian President Vladimir Putin to secure a peace agreement with Ukraine. Speaking in Scotland, Trump expressed his disappointment with Putin, citing Russia's continued missile attacks on Ukrainian cities despite supposed progress in peace talks. He did not specify the new, shorter timeline but reiterated his threat to impose massive "secondary tariffs" on Russia's trading partners if a ceasefire is not reached.</p>

          <p>When asked about Israeli claims that there is no starvation crisis in Gaza, former U.S. President Donald Trump responded, "I don't know," but noted that television images show very hungry children. The comments were made in Scotland during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who described the situation as an "absolute catastrophe." This exchange occurred as the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported additional deaths from malnutrition and Israeli airstrikes, highlighting the severe and ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has issued preliminary findings that Chinese online retailer Temu is violating the Digital Services Act (DSA) by failing to prevent the sale of illegal products. The EU's executive arm stated there is a high risk for consumers encountering non-compliant goods and also accused Temu of using fake discounts and an addictive app design. As a "very large online platform," Temu faces a potential fine of up to 6% of its global turnover if it fails to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>A recent article delves into why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive, often feeling deeply hurt by minor slights or offhand comments. It explains that this trait can stem from a combination of genetic predisposition and life experiences, such as a history of rejection. This heightened sensitivity is linked to a fundamental human need to feel valued in relationships. The article suggests coping strategies, such as questioning worst-case assumptions and being more discerning about whose opinions truly matter, to manage these intense emotional reactions.</p>

          <p>Horst Mahler, a controversial figure in German history, has died at the age of 89. He was a founding member of the violent far-left Red Army Faction in the 1970s, for which he served a prison sentence. After his release, he dramatically shifted his ideology to the far-right, becoming a prominent Holocaust denier and accumulating further convictions for incitement and hate speech. His life traced a path through Germany's most extreme political fringes, from militant leftism to neo-Nazism.</p>

          <p>To address its severe housing shortage and rising rents, the German government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) law to speed up building approvals. The legislation would allow municipalities to circumvent complex planning laws for new residential projects and would automatically approve applications after two months unless vetoed. While the construction industry welcomes the move to cut red tape, critics and environmentalists worry it may not be an effective short-term fix and could lead to the loss of green spaces.

This "America First" approach suggests redirecting resources from commitments in Europe and the Middle East to bolster military presence in the western Pacific to deter Beijing. Colby's divisive stance has sparked debate within the Republican party and among U.S. allies, reflecting a broader shift away from the U.S. acting as a global policeman toward a more focused defense of its core interests.</p>

          <p>An article examines the nature of "hard choices," drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang to argue they are not difficult because one option is secretly better, but because the options are "on a par." In these situations, external reasons are insufficient, forcing individuals to exercise their own agency and create reasons for themselves, thereby defining who they are. Instead of seeking a "correct" answer, the article suggests we should embrace these moments as opportunities to commit to our values and shape our own identities.</p>
