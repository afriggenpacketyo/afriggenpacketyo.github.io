          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:15:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively considering suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a constitutional right to challenge the legality of detention. Miller's comment came in response to a question about using this measure to address illegal immigration. He argued that the Constitution allows suspension during an invasion, reflecting the administration's view of the situation at the border. The decision hinges on whether the courts support the administration's deportation efforts, raising concerns about the separation of powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York is set to lower the minimum hiring age for prison guards from 21 to 18 in response to a severe correction officer shortage, exacerbated by the firing of over 2,000 guards after a strike protesting poor working conditions. The new law includes restrictions for younger guards, such as prohibiting them from carrying firearms or transporting inmates unsupervised during their first 18 months. This decision follows a period of unrest in the state's prison system, including the deployment of the National Guard and early releases of inmates convicted of minor crimes due to the shortage.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that GLP-1 medications, commonly used for weight loss and diabetes, may also help heavy drinkers reduce their alcohol consumption by nearly 70%. The study, involving 262 adults prescribed these medications, found that heavy drinkers experienced the most significant decrease in alcohol intake, with no participants reporting increased consumption. Researchers believe these drugs may affect brain chemicals tied to pleasure and fullness, providing individuals with greater control over their cravings.

          <p>Over a dozen largely Democratic states are suing President Trump's administration over his efforts to fast-track energy projects, saying the administration is bypassing environmental protection laws. Mr. Trump issued an executive order declaring a "national energy emergency" on the first day of his presidency â€” part of Mr. Trump's push to expand U.S. oil and gas production. The order urges oil and gas expansion through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.</p>

          <p>Fifteen states, primarily led by Democrats, are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to expedite energy projects, alleging the administration is circumventing environmental protection laws. The lawsuit challenges Trump's executive order declaring a "national energy emergency," which aims to expand oil and gas production. The states argue that agencies are bypassing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, causing irreparable harm to natural resources. The White House defends the order as crucial to economic and national security.</p>

          <p>Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson issued a stern warning to agency personnel, stating, "Don't get in my wayâ€¦ I will run right over you."

In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Bessent urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July to protect the full faith and credit of the United States. Failure to do so would wreak havoc on the financial system and diminish America's security and global leadership position. The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, and the Treasury Department has been using "extraordinary measures" since January.</p>
