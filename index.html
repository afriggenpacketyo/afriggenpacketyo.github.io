          <p>President Trump, during a press conference about his administration's deportation efforts, jokingly questioned the immigration status of workers installing new flagpoles at the White House. He asked if any of them were "illegal immigrants," prompting chuckles and headshakes from the construction crew. Trump added that their lives would be ruined if any were undocumented. The comments came after Trump instructed ICE to oversee a mass deportation program, targeting major cities with large undocumented populations. The flagpoles themselves were described by Trump as a gift to the White House, which he felt was missing them. Optimism surrounding this situation is relatively low due to the precarious nature of immigration and the implications of Trump's comments.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel is not pursuing regime change in Iran, clarifying that the country's actions are aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear capabilities. Herzog accused Iran of "cheating" and "rushing to the bomb," emphasizing that a regime change could potentially bring peace to the region. This statement follows recent Israeli airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations allegedly related to the country's nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency has urged Iran to fully cooperate to ensure its nuclear program is peaceful, while China has condemned Israel's actions, supporting Iran's sovereignty. The overall situation is tense, with ongoing back-channel talks attempting to de-escalate the conflict, and the future remains uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," a legal practice involving altering product materials or dimensions to fit into lower-tariffed categories. This strategy allows companies to reduce their duty liabilities by strategically redesigning products. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum elements or footwear companies adding fuzzy-felt fabric to classify sneakers as slippers. While effective for some sectors like garments and footwear, more sophisticated industries face challenges due to extensive validation requirements, but companies must tread carefully to avoid misrepresenting product classifications. This is a complex game of cat and mouse, where companies try to outsmart customs officials to save money.</p>

          <p>Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi warned that Iran would retaliate against the United States if it intervenes in the ongoing conflict on Israel's side. He stated that Iran would not be restrained in its response to any U.S. intervention, emphasizing the country's commitment to protecting its people and interests. While the U.S. government supports Israel's defense efforts, it has not officially participated in the military conflict, although President Trump has expressed consideration.

          <p>According to a Zillow report, choosing the right interior paint colors can boost a home's sale price by nearly $2,600. Olive green is the most desirable kitchen color, potentially increasing the sale price by $1,600, while classic navy blue walls are preferred in bedrooms, adding an estimated $1,815 in value. Dark gray living rooms are also favored over lighter colors, contributing an additional $2,600 to the offer. Bright and playful colors, such as lemon yellow or scarlet red, can negatively impact a home's sale price. The use of specific colors can greatly affect the appeal and value of a home for potential buyers.</p>

          <p>CBS reports that President Trump has approved plans to attack Iran but has not made a final decision, holding off in case Iran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. The report indicates that Trump is considering a strike on Fordo, an underground uranium enrichment facility. This news comes as Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. Israel has also launched more attacks on Iran, targeting missile sites and nuclear facilities, with Iran responding by firing hypersonic missiles.

Hashimoto believes the acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, but trade levies will not revive its manufacturing sector. The company finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after President Trump reversed his initial opposition. Nippon Steel has pledged to invest around $11 billion by 2028 in U.S. Steel and maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The deal includes a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, granting veto power over key management decisions.</p>

          <p>Jorge Hernández, a longtime DEA informant, has been charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud by extorting high-level cocaine traffickers facing extradition. Posing as a paralegal, Hernández allegedly demanded payments of $1 million from six suspected drug traffickers in exchange for guaranteed short prison sentences and favorable conditions. However, he never delivered on these promises and shifted blame to the traffickers' attorneys when they grew upset. Hernández, known as "Boliche," had been a prolific informant for two decades, contributing to major drug smuggling cases, but his cooperation agreement was terminated in 2008 after he threatened to expose other informants.</p>

          <p>The Social Security retirement trust fund may be depleted by 2033, according to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report, which is unchanged from last year's projections. At that point, only 77% of scheduled benefits will be payable.

The Disability Insurance fund is expected to be able to pay full benefits through at least 2099.
