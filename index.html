          <h2>Chinese Scientists Observe Quantum Friction Effect in Graphene for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has made a groundbreaking discovery by directly observing quantum friction in folded graphene. Contrary to classical physics, they found that friction did not always increase with thickness; some thicker folds actually slid more easily. This phenomenon was linked to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices and machines with minimal wear, marking a significant advance in materials science.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe has expressed strong support for the declassification of sensitive documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation, a move initiated by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The released documents include a 2017 House Intelligence Committee report that Gabbard claims shows Obama-era officials fabricated a narrative to undermine President Trump. The release has sparked controversy, with critics like Senator Mark Warner calling it irresponsible and a threat to national security sources and methods. The documents focus on intelligence that informed the assessment of Russian interference in the election.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 21:43:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Princeton, Texas, located north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2024. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for around $300,000 in a county where the median price is nearly $475,000. This rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing a temporary halt on construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines and roads to catch up. With 13,000 more homes already approved, the city is racing to manage its development as it projects a population of 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with the decision to be formalized at the UN General Assembly in September. Citing a commitment to peace and the urgent need to end the war in Gaza, Macron's move makes France the largest European nation to take this step. The decision was met with strong condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated it “rewards terror.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also rejected the plan, arguing it undermines peace efforts and disrespects the victims of the October 7th attack.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, Maria Carroccia, ruled that the accuser's testimony was not “credible or reliable,” leading to the not-guilty verdict for all five players. The case centered on the issue of consent, with the defense arguing the woman willingly participated, while she testified she was intoxicated and fearful. The players remain ineligible to play in the NHL pending the league's own review of the judge's findings in the closely watched trial.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, four other convicted traders are now appealing to have their own rate-rigging convictions overturned. All were found guilty of manipulating the Libor inter-bank lending rate, a scandal at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. The law firm representing the four men stated their intent to appeal in light of the new precedent. The original investigation was conducted by the Serious Fraud Office, which has declined to seek a retrial for Hayes and Palombo.</p>

          <p>Top Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, met with Ghislaine Maxwell in Florida to interview her about the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The meeting comes amid intense political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information from the federal investigation into Epstein's crimes. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed she answered all questions honestly, while her brother claimed she was prepared to present new evidence. The interview adds another layer to the escalating scandal, which has also seen the House Oversight Committee subpoena both the DOJ and Maxwell.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient named Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez is being detained and faces deportation after he accidentally drove across the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. When he tried to return, U.S. authorities arrested him, classifying his exit as a “self-deportation” and his return as an illegal re-entry. His attorney states he was out of the country for less than 30 minutes and that the government is showing no leniency. The case highlights the precarious situation for DACA recipients under the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies, as he now faces removal to El Salvador, a country he left as a child.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding in the mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, leading to road closures and the rescue of at least five people trapped by rushing water. The area has been highly vulnerable to flooding this summer due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the hillsides of vegetation. This event comes less than three weeks after a massive flood in the same community killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes. Videos on social media showed muddy water destroying property and toppling trees, underscoring the ongoing danger.</p>

          <p>The 2028 Democratic presidential primary appears to be unofficially underway, as potential candidates are already making strategic media appearances and shifting their rhetoric. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom have been featured on non-traditional podcasts and are adopting more centrist positions on cultural issues, such as transgender rights. This activity is seen as an early effort to appeal to a broader electorate and correct for the party's 2024 loss. Strategists believe this signals a necessary course correction for the party to reconnect with voters who felt alienated.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is gripping Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record last set in 1972. The extreme heat is disrupting life in the Arctic region, affecting the local tourism industry centered around Santa Claus's village and forcing reindeer to flee to roads to escape insects. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to climate change, noting that the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The event serves as a stark reminder of the accelerating impacts of global warming.</p>

          <p>The FCC has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal fraught with political controversy.

Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have decried the deal as a politically motivated transaction that erodes press freedom. The lone Democrat on the FCC committee dissented, calling the merger a result of “cowardly capitulation” that imposes unprecedented controls over newsroom decisions.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a “winner-take-all” situation, and reducing investment would be a sign of disbelief in one's ability to win. Pointing to Alphabet's strong earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests the investments are both urgent and necessary. He believes the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly, similar to Google's dominance in search. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The food industry is increasingly turning to natural sources for coloring as regulatory pressure mounts against artificial dyes like Red Dye No. 3. The FDA is phasing out certain petroleum-based dyes, prompting companies like Fermentalg and Sensient to innovate with alternatives derived from microalgae, carrots, and potatoes. While creating stable and vivid natural colors presents technical challenges, major food giants including Kellogg, Nestlé, and Kraft Heinz have pledged to eliminate artificial colors from their products. This marks a significant shift towards healthier ingredients, driven by consumer demand and new regulations.</p>

The meeting follows a warning from the European nations that they will reimpose stiff UN sanctions by the end of August if Iran fails to curb its nuclear activities and cooperate with IAEA inspectors. The effort is aimed at reviving diplomacy after nascent U.S.-Iran talks stalled. However, with Iran reacting defiantly to the threat and high levels of distrust, analysts see little chance of an agreement.</p>
