          <h2>Japan to Study Offshore Blue Carbon for CO2 Capture and Storage</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. Coastal and ocean plants like mangroves and kelp are known to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation, making them a key focus for mitigating climate change. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, marking a significant increase from the 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires are currently burning north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, with additional fires raging in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. As of May 19, the Minnesota fires cover approximately 30,000 acres, with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources leading the fight against the Munger Shaw fire, and the Eastern Area Complex Incident Team managing the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires. The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, while the Munger Shaw Fire is nearly fully contained. Interactive maps are available to track the fires' spread, and donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected community members in Lake and St. Louis Counties.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose as much as 14% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The CATL IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to use 90% of the funds raised to construct a factory in Hungary, which will supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL has faced challenges, including punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and being placed on a U.S. Pentagon watchlist over suspected ties to China's military, allegations the company denies.</p>

          <p>A report by the Cato Institute found that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had legally entered the US with government permission. The report analyzed immigration data for a portion of the men deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), contradicting the administration’s claim that only undocumented individuals were deported. The analysis indicated that some men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, while others were granted parole or resettled as refugees. The Trump administration controversially invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport over 200 alleged gang members to the Cecot prison in March.</p>

          <p>China has reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as part of Beijing's effort to stimulate the economy. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. State-backed commercial lenders also reduced deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates. The rate cuts are part of a package of stimulus measures, including reductions to the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves, and lower mortgage rates under the housing provident fund.</p>

Cristosal says López was arrested at her home late on Sunday evening by armed police and her whereabouts remain unknown, denouncing her arrest as "short-term enforced disappearance". Bukele's government claims its crackdown has made the country much safer, but critics say it has led to the detention of over 85,000 mainly young men and widespread human rights violations.</p>

McIver claimed that ICE agents instigated the clash and that the charges against her were politically motivated.

Despite previous intentions for a long-term relationship with China, the UK is currently not pursuing trade negotiations with the country. The ongoing conversation and negotiation will determine how much this will cost, precisely what it will mean for defence co-operation, who and how many young people may be able to travel more easily to the EU and vice versa and whether and by when there is a mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration considered acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, involving secret coordination between Washington and Doha. President Trump wanted a quicker solution to his Air Force One problem, leading to the exploration of alternative options. The plan morphed from a potential purchase to a proposed gift from Qatar, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial sense of refitting the plane for presidential use. The Qataris were willing to send the jet to Florida for Mr. Trump to take a personal tour, but the expectation was that the plane would be sold to the United States, not offered as a gift. This deal is controversial because the plane would be one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the U.S. government, for use by a specific person, with no plans to seek congressional approval.</p>

In February, Pottain created a GoFundMe page to seek financial support, revealing she had been bedridden since June 2024 due to health issues.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street and Netflix have struck a deal that will see the popular US television show appear on the streaming platform, while still being available on the free-to-air channel PBS. The deal ensures the program's continuation after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with HBO. Netflix will offer its 300 million subscribers around the world a new 56th season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes, and PBS will get access to episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix. This move will help to keep the show alive for future generations.</p>

          <p>The federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has been dismissed, with U.S. Attorney Alina Habba citing a desire to "move forward". However, U.S. Rep.

McIver maintains the charges are politically motivated and a mischaracterization of her actions. Habba has invited Mayor Baraka to tour Delaney Hall, stating that the government has nothing to hide at the facility.</p>

There has been a flurry of SPAC deals announced in the past month, and the most sought-after ones involve people in President Trump’s orbit or investments close to his heart. SPACs allow people to raise money in the stock market, without a business plan, and then acquire a business with the funds they raised, or they have to give the money back.
