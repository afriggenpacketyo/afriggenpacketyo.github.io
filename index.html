          <p>A New York Times article reveals that Los Angeles water managers had considered reviving an old reservoir to supplement water capacity in the Pacific Palisades before a major fire. However, the plan was never fully implemented due to safety concerns, leaving the area with a limited water supply when the fire broke out. Firefighters reported hydrants running dry as a result. The article underscores the importance of adequate infrastructure and preparedness in mitigating the impact of wildfires, and highlights potential legal ramifications for the city.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, designed to bolster the private economy, set to come into force on May 20. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely following the implementation of the law to determine whether the measure has teeth. Of particular interest is how the law will impact the ability of firms to take local-level governments to court, and how it will protect the private sector from fines that have long been considered arbitrary and profit-driven. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures.</p>

The new classification grants authorities greater powers to monitor the party.
