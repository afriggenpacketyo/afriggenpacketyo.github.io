          <p>Jorge Costa, the celebrated former captain of FC Porto, has passed away at the age of 53 from a cardiac arrest. Costa famously led the team to a Champions League victory in 2004 under manager Jose Mourinho and earned 50 caps for the Portuguese national team. After retiring as a player, he pursued a career in management before returning to Porto as the director of professional football. Tributes from former teammates and the broader football community have highlighted his leadership, dedication, and embodiment of the club's values, marking a significant loss for Portuguese football.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Statistical Office reports that individuals aged 15 to 24 now constitute only 10% of the nation's population, the lowest proportion ever recorded. This demographic figure has remained stagnant since late 2021 and was only slightly bolstered by the influx of young immigrants following the war in Ukraine. Without this immigration, the youth share would have dropped to just 8.5%. The data indicates a significant demographic shift, placing Germany below the European Union average of 10.7% and highlighting long-term challenges for the country's social and economic structure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration may impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, potentially reaching as high as 250%. The plan would start with a small initial tariff, which could escalate to 150% and then 250% within a year and a half. This strategy aims to incentivize drug manufacturers to relocate their production facilities to the United States, addressing the decline in domestic drug manufacturing. The pharmaceutical industry has warned that such tariffs could lead to increased costs, disrupt supply chains, and negatively impact investment in research and development.

          <p>A debate in Germany over reducing welfare for Ukrainian refugees highlights the significant disparities in aid across Europe. Germany currently provides generous support, including a monthly stipend of €563 for single adults plus housing and health insurance costs, placing it among the most supportive nations. In contrast, countries like Poland offer access to services but no monthly payments, while Hungary has tightened its eligibility criteria. Belgium offers the highest monthly assistance in the EU at around €1,100, demonstrating the lack of a standardized approach to refugee support within the bloc.</p>

The bipartisan effort seeks depositions and documents from the Justice Department concerning its handling of the case against Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Committee Chairman James Comer stated the investigation aims to inform potential legislative reforms to combat sex trafficking and improve how plea agreements are used in such cases. This move follows the Justice Department's recent conclusion that it would not release further files on the matter.</p>

          <p>Following several recent emergency evacuations, Senator Tammy Duckworth is pressing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for answers regarding its 90-second evacuation standard. Citing an American Airlines incident in Denver where the evacuation reportedly took up to 15 minutes, Duckworth expressed concern that current standards don't reflect real-world conditions, such as passengers retrieving carry-on luggage. In a letter to the new FAA Administrator, she requested data from recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated safety tests. Experts agree that the standards, which are nearly 35 years old, require reassessment to ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has proposed a public safety plan that involves dispatching social workers and other non-police professionals to certain 911 calls. Mamdani argues this approach would address issues like mental health crises more effectively and alleviate the workload on NYPD officers, potentially reducing forced overtime and improving retention. He suggests that professionals like "transit ambassadors" could handle minor incidents, allowing police to focus on serious crime. The proposal has drawn criticism from incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who called the idea of sending civilians to potentially dangerous situations "reckless."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to claim significant cost savings, but a CBS News review suggests these figures are highly inflated. An analysis of three major contract cancellations from the Department of Health and Human Services, which DOGE claimed saved $6.4 billion, found the actual savings to be around $165 million, or less than 3% of the reported amount. These contracts were for pandemic-related services and were unlikely to use their full potential funding. Critics argue that DOGE's public accounting is a form of "transparency theater," presenting unrealistic savings to the public.</p>

His attorneys argued that the lethal injection could trigger the device, causing unnecessary pain, but the state's Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate it. Black, who had multiple health issues including dementia and heart failure, was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two daughters.

Researchers suggest this trend is partly due to consumers overextending themselves amid rising inflation and the end of pandemic-era leniency.

          <p>The National Park Service has announced plans to restore and reinstall a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that was torn down by protesters in Washington D.C. during the 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations. The agency cited federal historic preservation laws and recent executive orders as the basis for its decision. The statue has long been controversial due to Pike's role in the Confederacy and alleged ties to the Ku Klux Klan. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has vowed to reintroduce legislation to permanently remove the statue, calling its reinstallation "morally objectionable."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on Brazil and sanctioned a Supreme Court justice, escalating tensions between the two nations. The move is widely seen as a response to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a political ally of Trump, for attempting to overturn his 2022 election loss. The White House has framed the prosecution as politically motivated, a narrative pushed by Bolsonaro's allies in the U.S. This unprecedented action has damaged a historically strong relationship, with Brazilian officials insisting their judiciary is independent and will not yield to external political pressure.</p>

          <p>The House Ethics Committee has reprimanded Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for inconsistently identifying her fiancé, Riley Roberts, as her "spouse" on official documents. A committee report noted that she listed him as a spouse on travel paperwork for the 2021 Met Gala, which granted him benefits under the Gift Rule, but did not list him as such on financial disclosures, which would have required reporting his assets. While the committee is closing its investigation into the Met Gala attendance after she repays remaining costs, it criticized the conflicting designations and the advantage taken of rules meant for legally married couples.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July, falling short of expectations and indicating a sharp economic slowdown. Compounding the weak report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) significantly revised down its figures for May and June, showing only 33,000 jobs were added over that two-month period. Job losses were concentrated in sectors like professional services and manufacturing, while healthcare remained a strong area of growth. The report also showed an increase in long-term unemployment, painting a challenging picture for the current labor market and leading President Trump to fire the BLS commissioner.

Iliescu served two terms as president and was a dominant figure in Romanian politics for years, though his legacy is complex. He faced accusations of crimes against humanity for his role in the violent 1989 revolution that overthrew the communist regime and for a bloody crackdown on student protesters in 1990. Although charged, he was never convicted and had largely withdrawn from public life in recent years due to declining health.</p>
