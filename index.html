          <p>Jeannie Seely, the Grammy-winning country singer known as "Miss Country Soul," has passed away at the age of 85 due to complications from an intestinal infection. A prominent member of the Grand Ole Opry for over 55 years, Seely was celebrated for her trailblazing career and hits like "Don't Touch Me." She was also known for challenging norms, famously wearing a miniskirt on the Opry stage in an era of conservative dress codes. Figures like Dolly Parton and Charlie Daniels paid tribute, remembering her as a dear friend, a great singer, and a national treasure who continued performing and hosting until recently.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth. The president, without evidence, accused the commissioner of manipulating figures for political reasons, a move that has alarmed economists and raised concerns about the integrity of federal economic data. This decision coincided with a global stock market downturn, as investors reacted negatively to the administration's plans to implement sharp new tariffs on international goods. Critics argue that firing the BLS head undermines the unbiased statistics essential for economic decision-making by businesses and policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a major case next term that will scrutinize the constitutionality of using race in legislative redistricting. The court will specifically address whether Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unlawful racial gerrymander under the 14th or 15th Amendments. This case emerges from a prolonged legal fight over the state's map following the 2020 Census, which was challenged by a group of non-Black voters. The ruling is expected to have significant consequences for how states draw political lines and could affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives.</p>

According to the police report, security footage showed Richardson pushing the man, causing him to fall, and later throwing a pair of headphones at him at a TSA checkpoint. The man, who identified himself as her boyfriend, stated he did not wish to press charges. Richardson, who recently won a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, was booked and released the next day while scheduled to compete at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.</p>

          <p>A crash involving a tractor-trailer on Interstate 83 in Pennsylvania resulted in a messy and unusual traffic jam after the truck's cargo of hot dogs spilled across the roadway. The incident occurred when the truck experienced mechanical problems and collided with another vehicle, causing its trailer to rip open against a concrete divider. Four individuals were treated for non-life-threatening injuries sustained in the collision. First responders, including the local fire chief, noted the unexpected slipperiness of the hot dogs, which complicated cleanup efforts and added a strange element to the morning commute disruption just north of the Maryland state line.</p>

The paper, featured in the Journal of Climate, posits that this "solar precipitation regime" affects the positioning of the monsoon rain belt, a critical factor for the country's seasonal climate predictions. Understanding this connection is crucial, as the distribution of summer rainfall significantly impacts the occurrence of droughts and floods across different regions of China, making it a key area of focus for climate forecasting.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump at his New Jersey golf club, just one day after the president publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies drastically lower their drug prices. In letters sent to Pfizer and 16 other drugmakers, Trump called for them to match the lower prices paid in other countries, setting a 60-day deadline for commitments. The apparent contradiction of the CEO attending a $25 million pro-Trump event highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that price controls could stifle innovation while facing political pressure over high healthcare costs.</p>

          <p>Officials in Seal Beach, California, are warning beachgoers of a significant rise in stingray injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15 in recent weeks. Lifeguards attribute the increase to calm, warm waters attracting more stingrays closer to shore, combined with hot weather drawing larger crowds to the beach. The area near the San Gabriel River, known locally as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, experts advise shuffling one's feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish, and treating any stings by soaking the wound in hot water.</p>

          <p>A review of the Environmental Protection Agency's own regulatory analysis indicates that the Trump administration's plan to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards would lead to higher gasoline prices and significant job losses. While the administration claimed the move would save Americans billions, data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency cited in the report projects that disincentivizing electric vehicles will increase demand for gasoline, driving up costs for all consumers. The analysis also forecasts the loss of approximately 450,000 jobs by 2035 and a reduction in fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles compared to previous policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent executive order to hike tariffs on imports is expected to increase consumer prices and create extended uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. The new duties, which set a baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, could cost the average American household over $2,000 annually and raise prices on goods like cars, clothing, and furniture. While the administration argues the tariffs are necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing, economists warn of potential inflation and supply chain disruptions.

          <p>A new and specific form of psychological trauma, dubbed "droneophobia," is emerging among Ukrainian soldiers returning from the front lines.

A chief psychiatrist at Kyiv's military hospital reports that a majority of his patients now suffer from mental health injuries related to drone activity.

          <p>In a historic ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and fraud, making him the first ex-president in the nation's history to be convicted of a crime. The 73-year-old, who served from 2002 to 2010, was also barred from holding public office and fined. The conviction stems from a long-running case in which he was accused of pressuring witnesses, including jailed ex-paramilitaries, to give false testimony in his favor. Uribe maintains his innocence, claiming the case is politically motivated, and has stated he will appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>An immigration detainee with two electronic prosthetic legs was placed in solitary confinement at a Georgia detention center after he complained about hazardous conditions. The man, Rodney Taylor, refused to enter his cell area because flooding from a faulty air conditioner posed a risk of damaging his prosthetics. In response, guards at the CoreCivic-run Stewart facility put him in what they call a "restrictive housing unit" for three days. This incident is the latest in a series of challenges Taylor has faced in detention, highlighting concerns from advocates about the system's inability to properly care for detainees with significant medical needs and disabilities.</p>

          <p>The UK's plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state is being presented as a way to revive the two-state solution, but it faces significant skepticism on the ground. For many Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank, the diplomatic gesture feels disconnected from the reality of expanding Israeli settlements and settler violence, which they say makes a viable state impossible. While Palestinian diplomats welcome the move as a serious step away from mere lip service, Israeli officials have condemned it as a "reward for terrorism." The article suggests that despite the historic nature of the announcement, deep-seated conflict and facts on the ground may render it too little, too late.</p>

          <p>All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons has officially requested a trade, stating on social media that he "no longer want[s] to play for the Dallas Cowboys." The 26-year-old star has been sitting out of on-field activities during training camp while seeking a lucrative long-term contract extension. In a detailed post, Parsons expressed frustration with the team's negotiation tactics, claiming the front office has not engaged in contract talks with his agent and has created negative media narratives about him. This public demand escalates the contract standoff and puts the Cowboys in a difficult position regarding one of their most impactful defensive players.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare look into a clandestine scheme where the regime sends thousands of IT workers abroad to earn foreign currency. Posing as Westerners with fake identities, these workers secure remote jobs with U.S. and European companies, earning significant salaries, up to 85% of which is sent back to fund the cash-strapped government. The defector, identified as Jin-su, explained how he used hundreds of fake IDs to obtain work, sometimes earning over $5,000 a month. This operation, which a UN report estimates generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually, exploits the rise of remote work to bypass international sanctions.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" aimed at stopping medical providers from offering gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The suit argues the White House and Justice Department are using intimidation tactics, such as threatening criminal prosecution and demanding patient data, to create a de facto national ban on such care. This legal action follows the closure of several prominent gender clinics at children's hospitals, even in states where the care is legal, due to what providers describe as an atmosphere of fear and an untenable regulatory environment.</p>

          <p>In a significant legal setback for Tesla, a Florida jury has found the company partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed one pedestrian and severely injured another while a Model S was using its Autopilot software. The plaintiffs successfully argued that the driver-assistance system should have alerted the distracted driver and applied the brakes before the collision. Tesla, which maintained the driver was solely at fault, has been ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages and has vowed to appeal the verdict. This case is notable as the first of its kind involving a fatal Autopilot crash to reach a jury decision.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has delivered a mixed ruling on car finance mis-selling, closing the door on millions of potential compensation claims based on hidden commissions. The court decided not to uphold an earlier finding that secret commission payments to car dealers were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment did leave open the possibility for individual consumers to claim compensation if they can prove the commission arrangement was unfair, as one of the claimants in the case successfully did. The decision significantly reduces the potential liability for lenders, which was once estimated to be as high as £30 billion.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner is part of a long-standing pattern of rejecting objective numbers that do not align with his desired narrative. The author satirically draws parallels between this action and Trump's disputes with his weight, golf scores, and the 2020 election results, suggesting a belief that reality can be altered through loyalty and intimidation. The piece warns that dismantling trust in nonpartisan data agencies will leave policymakers and the public in a fog of misinformation, unable to diagnose or address real economic problems, relying instead on subjective "vibes."

Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever, while Call provides a solid right-handed bat for the outfield.

Key red flags include "love bombing," where new members are showered with affection to gain control, and the promise of simple answers to life's complex problems. Cults often use specialized language and buzzwords to create an "us-versus-them" mentality and may restrict access to outside information. A critical warning sign is a high barrier to exit, where members fear losing their identity, relationships, or facing retaliation if they try to leave, highlighting the coercive control that defines these groups.</p>

These figures suggest that the social media giant is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture.
