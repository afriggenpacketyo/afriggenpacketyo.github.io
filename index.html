          <p>Sussex Police have released images of two individuals they wish to identify in connection with a suspected arson at a mosque in Peacehaven, East Sussex. The incident, which is being investigated as a hate crime, caused damage to the building's entrance and a vehicle but resulted in no injuries. This attack has heightened concerns about safety at places of worship, drawing parallels to a recent fatal incident at a Manchester synagogue and prompting calls for unity from community leaders and the Home Secretary. Authorities have increased patrols around religious sites to provide reassurance to the public.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7 attack, Israel has only partially achieved its stated war aims of recovering all hostages and destroying Hamas. While some hostages have been returned and key Hamas leaders eliminated, the group still operates in Gaza, where the conflict has caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis with tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties and widespread displacement. The war has also led to international condemnation, accusations of genocide, and increased recognition of Palestinian statehood by several countries. Despite weakening regional adversaries like Hezbollah, Israel faces deep social fragmentation at home over the war's direction.</p>

          <p>During his hosting debut on Saturday Night Live, musical artist Bad Bunny responded to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's warning that immigration agents would be present at his upcoming Super Bowl halftime show. The Puerto Rican singer, who is a US citizen, used his monologue to champion the contributions of Latinos in the United States and joked about the conservative backlash to his performance. The appearance follows Noem's controversial remarks suggesting only Americans should attend the event, which sparked criticism given Bad Bunny's citizenship and his vocal stance against aggressive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined a two-phase approach to ending the Gaza conflict, emphasizing the immediate need to finalize logistics for the release of all hostages. He stated that while Hamas has agreed to the framework, the mechanics of the release must be established quickly in talks mediated by regional partners, which would necessitate a halt in Israeli bombardments. Rubio also discussed the long-term challenge of establishing a non-terrorist, technocratic Palestinian leadership to govern Gaza, a necessary step for lasting peace, while navigating complex questions about future Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>A woman was shot by federal agents in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood after Department of Homeland Security officers reported being rammed and boxed in by multiple vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, and another individual, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, have since been charged with assaulting a federal officer. The incident, which DHS stated involved a driver with a semi-automatic weapon, led to tense standoffs between protesters and federal agents at the scene. DHS has deployed special operations teams to the area, citing a need to "restore law and order."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he believes hostages held in Gaza will be released "very soon," as Israeli and Hamas delegations prepare for indirect talks in Egypt. The negotiations center on a 20-point US peace plan, which Hamas has partially accepted, focusing on hostage release and a transition of governance in Gaza to technocrats. Despite Trump's call for an immediate halt to bombing, Israeli airstrikes have continued in Gaza, with officials stating they are for defensive purposes. The upcoming talks are considered highly consequential for potentially ending the nearly two-year-long conflict.</p>

Badenoch is facing pressure over the party's poor performance since she took leadership, but she maintains that a deliberate and thoughtful approach is necessary to avoid past mistakes and deliver a solid plan for the country.</p>

          <p>Despite the federal government shutdown, the U.S. stock market demonstrated strong performance, with the S&P 500 closing the week at a record high. Wall Street's calculus appears to be that a temporary shutdown will not significantly impact the economy or corporate profits, as furloughed workers are expected to receive back pay. Investors are also seemingly unconcerned by President Trump's threats of mass federal firings, betting they will not materialize or will be tied up in litigation. However, the lack of official economic data and the potential for a prolonged shutdown remain key risks for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The clashes occurred amid ongoing political crisis following last year's disputed election, which the pro-EU opposition claims was stolen by the ruling Georgian Dream party. The protest coincided with local elections that were largely boycotted by the opposition, further cementing the ruling party's power.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, often making a simple question feel like an accusation. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate conflicts by becoming self-aware, apologizing for a harsh tone, and rephrasing their statements. For those on the receiving end, calmly asking their partner to speak differently can interrupt a negative cycle before it intensifies.</p>

The area has a history of significant seismic activity, with the last major events being the magnitude 6.3 Big Bear and magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquakes, which struck on the same day in June 1992, causing substantial damage and one fatality.</p>

          <p>George Russell secured his second victory of the season at the Singapore Grand Prix, while McLaren clinched the constructors' championship amidst growing friction between its drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. The tension flared at the start of the race when Norris made contact with Piastri while passing him, a move Piastri called "not fair" over the team radio. Russell led a dominant race for Mercedes, finishing ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who held off a late charge from Norris. The incident between the McLaren teammates adds scrutiny to their internal title battle as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, researcher and author Brené Brown argued that effective communication requires a "tolerance for discomfort" because it involves vulnerability and honesty. She stated that people often struggle with communication because they are not taught how to be clear, use precise language, or take accountability when they misspeak or cause upset. Brown stressed the importance of verbal conversations over text to avoid losing tone, and the need to own one's mistakes. The article also provides phrases to help navigate conflict, such as paraphrasing the other person's point and leading with empathy to validate their feelings.</p>

          <p>An article from "48 Hours" details the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Hillsboro, Oregon. Detectives believed the primary crime scene was a maroon minivan used by the killer, who was later identified as Dr. Steven Milner, a man who had been stalking the victim. The investigation became a race against time when police discovered the minivan had been towed and sold to a scrapyard. Despite their efforts, detectives arrived just a week too late, learning that the crucial piece of evidence had already been crushed and destroyed, complicating the prosecution's case against the suspect.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, a complex, indirect process to form a new People's Assembly. Instead of a public vote, members of an "electoral college," appointed by subcommittees, will choose 121 parliamentarians, with another 70 to be directly appointed by the interim president. While the transitional government says this process is necessary due to displacement and instability, it has drawn criticism for being vulnerable to manipulation and granting excessive power to the interim leader. Minority groups and civil society organizations have questioned the legitimacy of the process, calling it a superficial charade.</p>

          <p>The Wayne National Forest, Ohio's sole national forest, is being targeted for large-scale logging under a Trump administration executive order aimed at increasing lumber production on federal lands. The forest, established on former coal-mined land, is a vital ecosystem and recreational area. Environmental groups and local advocates express grave concerns that clear-cutting could release pollutants from old mining waste trapped in the soil, contaminating waterways like the Ohio River. While proponents cite economic benefits for the rural Appalachian region, critics argue that logging could increase flood and fire risks and that it is unnecessary given the vast majority of Ohio's forests are privately owned.</p>
