          <p>International pop star Dua Lipa has officially been granted citizenship in Kosovo, the home country of her parents. The ceremony was led by President Vjosa Osmani, who praised Lipa as a significant cultural figure who has gracefully represented Kosovo on the world stage. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has consistently expressed her strong connection to the nation, notably through her charity work and the establishment of the Sunny Hill Festival. This marks her third citizenship, as she also holds passports from the United Kingdom and Albania.</p>

          <p>A new study from Hiroshima University in Japan suggests that a common sweetener could have anti-cancer applications. Researchers found that stevia leaf extract, when fermented with a specific bacterium, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant activity and was effective at killing pancreatic cancer cells in a laboratory setting. Medical experts caution that these are very early findings and the process has not yet been tested in humans to determine its safety or efficacy. While the discovery is seen as a promising step in finding new treatments, it is not expected to lead to immediate changes in patient care.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, assuring them of President Trump's commitment to securing the release of their loved ones held in Gaza. The meeting occurred amid ongoing protests as families urge the Israeli government to prioritize a deal for the remaining captives, whose well-being is a growing concern. Witkoff reportedly promised to hold Hamas accountable and work towards returning the hostages. The visit also included a tour of a U.S.-backed humanitarian aid distribution site, which has been a location of violence and desperation for Gazans seeking food.</p>

In a public statement, Beach called the dismissal "totally groundless" and warned that it establishes a "dangerous precedent" that undermines the credibility of federal economic data. He, along with other experts, urged Congress to investigate the matter, emphasizing that politicizing official statistics could damage public trust and harm the economy.

          <p>Several senior Republican senators have voiced concerns over President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a disappointing jobs report. Lawmakers including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis stated that firing a statistician over unfavorable but accurate numbers is problematic and undermines the need for objective data. The move has alarmed members of Trump's own party, who worry it politicizes a vital government agency and could erode trust in official economic statistics. Former Trump-appointed BLS Commissioner William Beach also called the firing "totally groundless" and dangerous.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by Stephen Starring Grant, who became a rural mail carrier after losing his corporate job, is highlighted for its insights into the essential nature of postal work. The book, reviewed in The Atlantic, details how mail delivery provides a sense of order and predictability, especially during national crises. It explores the daily challenges and quiet heroism of carriers who ensure communities, even the most remote, remain connected. The article frames the postal service as a crucial federal bureaucracy that helps maintain a sense of normalcy in an often chaotic world.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza report a worsening starvation crisis, stating that international aid efforts are failing to provide meaningful relief on the ground. Despite increased deliveries via the US-backed GHF and airdrops, residents describe the quest for food as a "death journey," citing deadly incidents near distribution sites. The article highlights the disconnect between the dire humanitarian situation and the diplomatic arguments over Palestinian statehood, with Gazans expressing that political statements are meaningless without tangible changes.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a potential pardon for music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs is complicated by Combs's previously hostile comments. In a recent interview, Trump acknowledged that while he considers Combs “sort of half-innocent” following his conviction, past criticisms make the decision more difficult. Combs, who was found guilty of two counts of transportation for prostitution, had made statements in 2020 calling for Trump to be removed from office. Trump admitted that such remarks cloud his judgment, even as he has a history of pardoning political supporters.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe reveals a stark contrast in how much apartment space a $1,500 monthly rent payment can secure in major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget affords an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can get a renter 1,329 square feet. The data highlights the extreme housing affordability challenges in large coastal cities like Boston and San Francisco, where supply shortages and high demand lead to smaller, more expensive units. Conversely, cities in the Midwest and South offer significantly more space for the same price due to more available land and lower housing costs.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has found Tesla partially responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology, ordering the company to pay over $240 million in damages. The case involved a driver who, while distracted, crashed into a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs successfully argued that Tesla's technology was defective and that the company failed to ensure its system was used safely, even hiding key data from the accident. The verdict is seen as a significant legal setback for Tesla as it prepares to launch a driverless taxi service.</p>

          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of €3,248 per month, creating a significant financial burden for many retirees whose average pension is around €1,100. This dramatic increase is attributed primarily to rising wages for care staff and an increase in staffing levels. With an aging population, the number of people needing care is expected to grow by 37% by 2055, placing Germany's long-term care insurance system under immense pressure. Policymakers are now urgently seeking reforms to address the widening gap between income and care expenditures.</p>

          <p>A recently declassified annex from the John Durham special counsel report has further weakened claims of a high-level conspiracy to undermine Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The document concludes that emails central to the so-called “Clinton Plan intelligence,” which suggested a plot to link Trump and Russia, were likely a composite created by Russian intelligence hackers. This finding contradicts the narrative, championed by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, of a “treasonous conspiracy” by Obama-era officials. The revelation that Russian spies fabricated the evidence deals a significant blow to the theory of a deep state plot against Trump.</p>

          <p>A Florida mother who endured debilitating pain for months after foot surgery was eventually diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. The condition, which can occur after an injury or surgery, caused her extreme pain from the lightest touch. After multiple specialists failed to provide relief, she found a physical therapist specializing in CRPS who developed a multi-pronged treatment plan. Through a combination of specialized physical therapy, relaxation exercises, medication, and ketamine infusions, she has been able to regain much of her functionality and improve her quality of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that while the administration can deny access to the discretionary asylum system, it cannot ignore U.S. laws that mandate protection for migrants facing persecution or torture if deported. This means officials must still consider claims for "withholding of removal" and protections under the UN Convention Against Torture, which have a higher legal bar than asylum. The ruling stems from a challenge to a presidential proclamation that has been used to summarily expel migrants without a hearing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that such sweeps, conducted by the Trump administration, appeared to be unconstitutionally predicated on broad profiles rather than reasonable suspicion of an individual being in the country illegally. The ruling is a victory for immigrant advocates who argued that the "roving patrols" by ICE and CBP agents were instilling fear and violating constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town that experienced decades of decline before being revitalized by a growing immigrant community, is now facing a climate of fear due to a harsh immigration crackdown. The local Butler County jail, run by an outspoken anti-immigration sheriff, primarily houses detainees on immigration-related charges, earning significant fees from ICE. This enforcement, coupled with the recent detention of a prominent local imam, has created deep anxiety within the Hispanic and other immigrant groups who have helped bring back economic and cultural vibrancy. The situation reflects a wider national split on immigration policy and its community-level consequences.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell is pursuing a multi-pronged legal and political strategy in an effort to overturn her 20-year prison sentence for child sex-trafficking. Her recent high-profile meeting with the Justice Department is seen by experts as one of several avenues she is exploring, which also include a Supreme Court appeal and a potential grant of clemency from President Trump. Legal analysts suggest that while the chances of success are slim, Maxwell has nothing to lose by exploring every option. Her actions are viewed less as a genuine effort to reveal truths about Jeffrey Epstein and more as a calculated attempt to leverage the current political climate for her own freedom.</p>

          <p>A team of 13-to-16-year-old baseball players from Maracaibo, Venezuela, was unable to compete in the Senior League World Series in South Carolina after being denied travel visas to the United States.

The decision raises questions about exemptions for athletes under a presidential proclamation that restricts entry for citizens of several countries, including Venezuela. While the State Department cited processing times, the incident highlights the human impact of broad immigration policies on international sporting events.</p>

          <p>The European Union's first concrete proposal to penalize Israel for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has stalled due to internal divisions among its 27 member states. The plan, which would bar Israeli startups from certain EU research funds, was proposed by the European Commission over violations of human rights. However, countries including Germany have requested more time, effectively pausing the measure. This reflects a long-standing split within the EU, with some nations like Spain and Ireland advocating for a strong response, while others like Hungary and Germany have been more supportive of Israel.</p>

While this proximity provides new food sources like rodents, it also creates conflict with farmers and exposes the cats to new dangers, including microplastic pollution found in their systems. Scientists warn that the presence of microplastics in these apex predators is an indicator of environmental contamination that will likely affect humans as well.

With its extensive experience in the data center sector, including a successful campaign at Switch, Elliott may push for changes to amplify returns.
