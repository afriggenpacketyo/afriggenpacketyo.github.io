          <p>At least 32 people, including 14 children, have died following catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise, with dozens of campers still reported missing. Rescue operations are extensive, with over 160 air rescues performed and hundreds of first responders on the scene. Officials noted the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, and the area lacked a sufficient warning system for such a rapid and severe weather event.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and hospitalized after responding to a call about a suspicious person outside an ICE detention facility. The officer, who has since been released, was ambushed by an unknown number of suspects who opened fire. Following the incident, several armed individuals, some reportedly wearing body armor, were apprehended after attempting to flee. The Justice Department is monitoring the situation, which involved vandalism and fireworks apparently used to lure law enforcement to the scene.</p>

          <p>Following a public dispute with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." However, establishing a new national party is a formidable challenge, even for the world's wealthiest person. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased towards the two major parties and would likely trigger expensive legal battles. Experts suggest that building a viable national party would be a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced the deportation of eight non-citizen criminals to South Sudan on July 4th. The individuals had extensive and violent criminal histories, including convictions for murder, sexual assault, and kidnapping. Their removal had been previously blocked by lower court rulings, which were overturned by the Supreme Court, allowing the deportations to proceed. DHS officials framed the event as a victory for the rule of law and public safety, criticizing what they termed "activist judges" for the delays.</p>

Approximately 1,000 emergency personnel have been deployed to fight the blazes, which have affected an estimated 1,000 hectares (2,470 acres). The fire in the Gohrischheide region on the Saxony-Brandenburg border remains particularly challenging. Authorities in Thuringia reported their situation has stabilized, but the fires represent a significant environmental and public safety challenge for the region, described as the largest of its kind in over 30 years for one state.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Faces Backlash from Jewish Groups for Using Antisemitic "Shylock" Term</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn sharp criticism after using the word "Shylocks" to describe some bankers during a rally in Iowa. The term, which originates from a ruthless Jewish moneylender character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is widely considered an offensive antisemitic trope. Jewish anti-discrimination groups like the ADL called the president's language "very troubling and irresponsible." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations and believed it simply meant a money lender charging high rates.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation's founding was a bloody civil war, and understanding its flaws does not diminish its ideals but makes them more inspiring. Burns argued that heroism is not perfection and that we must embrace the founders' complexities, such as Jefferson's articulation of freedom while owning slaves. He views history as a vital lifeline for navigating present-day divisions.</p>

          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT about taxing billionaires at middle-class rates revealed that the core issue is not tax rates on income, but how wealth itself is taxed. The AI explained that the ultra-wealthy utilize strategies like "buy-borrow-die" to live off tax-free loans against their appreciating assets, paying a very low effective tax rate on their actual wealth growth. If the wealth growth of billionaires was taxed at a rate similar to middle-class income, it could generate hundreds of billions in additional annual revenue for public services.

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of its voters in Kent revealed a prevailing sense of disappointment. Participants felt the government had not delivered on key promises, particularly on immigration, and some felt "lied to." While some were forgiving, seeing the first year as a time to "steady the ship," others were critical of the party's frequent policy U-turns, viewing them as a sign of having no clear direction. The discussion also highlighted the growing appeal of the Reform UK party for some disillusioned voters.</p>

McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his business dealings were compliant with regulations, but requested the whip be suspended as a "precautionary measure."

          <p>President Trump has escalated his threats against political opponents, recently targeting Elon Musk, prospective NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, and a former Biden official. He suggested Musk could lose federal subsidies and citizenship, and that Mamdani could be arrested or investigated over his citizenship. These warnings are seen by democracy advocates as a dangerous use of state power to intimidate and silence critics, regardless of their political alignment. The threats themselves are viewed as an attack on freedom, creating a climate of fear where opposing the president could lead to retribution.</p>
