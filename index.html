          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) currently holds a substantial financial advantage over the Democratic National Committee (DNC), possessing nearly five times more cash on hand. This disparity, amounting to a $57 million gap, marks the widest difference between the two parties since at least July 2020. Some Democrats express concerns that this fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, including a lack of confidence from donors and a need for a more inspiring vision. The DNC, however, highlights a surge in grassroots support, having raised approximately $40 million in individual donations since February, which is a record for that period, and it is also roughly double what it held during the same period in 2017.

          <p>Senator Jack Reed has criticized President Trump's dismissal of the intelligence community's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed described Trump's actions as "shocking" and suggested that the president might be disavowing his own intelligence chief for political reasons. He argued that Trump's stance could be influenced by a desire to justify potential military action against Iran. Reed emphasized that if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard had made a false statement in her testimony, it should be corrected immediately, rather than being dismissed following Israeli actions. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil was arrested for his role in pro-Palestinian protests and the administration sought to deport him, arguing that his activism was detrimental to foreign policy interests. Speaking after his release, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and accused the White House of dehumanizing those who disagree with the administration. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that Khalil's release shows the administration is losing the legal battle to deport pro-Palestinian activists. </p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators in Berlin criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran. Protesters in London waved Palestinian flags and carried signs, expressing concerns about the ongoing conflict and its potential for regional devastation. The overall death toll in Gaza since the start of the war has reached at least 55,637 people, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents the administration from stripping universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued would threaten critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and other technology fields. The judge deemed the policy change, which capped indirect expenses at 15%, as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Similar caps on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges. </p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Republican proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states would violate Senate rules. This is a setback for the Republicans' tax and spending cut bill, as they were counting on potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The parliamentarian did allow a provision to impose new work requirements for older Americans to receive food stamp aid. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package would add at least $2.4 trillion to the nation's debt and leave millions without health care coverage. (not investment advice)</p>
