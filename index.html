          <p>Canada is holding a pivotal election that could reshape its relationship with the U.S., especially given the tensions stoked by Donald Trump's presidency. Trump's actions, including remarks about annexing Canada and imposing tariffs, have stirred Canadian nationalism and influenced the election dynamics. The Liberal Party's popularity has surged in response to Trump, creating a close race with the Conservative Party. The next government will need to navigate challenges such as a sluggish economy and housing issues, all while managing the complex relationship with its southern neighbor.</p>

The U.S. has reportedly proposed accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea and control of Luhansk, while Europe seeks stronger U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rise of anti-liberal powers and the assault on liberal values, compounded by actions from the United States, necessitate a determined fightback from liberal internationalists. The Canadian election is seen as a potential contribution to this effort. Coalitions of counter-power, composed of states, civil society actors, and active citizens, are essential to promoting free trade, curbing monopolistic platforms, and supporting Ukraine. The fight requires addressing the problems created by liberalism itself, such as inequality and neglect of certain societal groups.</p>
