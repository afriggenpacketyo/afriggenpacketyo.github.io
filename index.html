          <p>A 400-page report from the Department of Health and Human Services, commissioned under an executive order titled "Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," questions the current approach to health care for transgender children. The report, whose anonymous authors claim that gender-affirming care has "fallen short of their duty to prioritize the health interests of young patients," has been criticized by the American Academy of Pediatrics for misrepresenting medical consensus and relying on narrow data. The report mirrors the Cass Review in the U.K., which also questions the benefits of gender-affirming care. The physician quoted in the article who provides gender-affirming care states that the report is propaganda designed to undermine transgender rights and healthcare.</p>

          <p>Apple anticipates a $900 million negative impact this quarter due to tariffs, despite some electronics being spared from import taxes. In response, the company is reconfiguring its supply chain, moving iPhone production for the American market to India, with the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. expected to be made there by June. Production of iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods is also being shifted to Vietnam.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have damaged American democracy more than any period since Reconstruction. They accuse him of attempting to create a presidency unbound by Congress or the courts, which they view as an autocratic approach that the nation's founders sought to prevent. The editorial calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions, while acknowledging his legitimate election and some potentially effective policies. The piece emphasizes the need to distinguish between unwise actions and those that violate constitutional principles, advocating for principled and strategic opposition.</p>

          <p>Leaders overseeing California's high-speed rail project are voicing concerns about its financial viability, especially with potential loss of federal funding. The authority's board approved contracts for station designs, but members raised concerns about payment commitments if federal funds are not secured. The Department of Transportation initiated a compliance review of the project, focusing on a $4 billion promise made under the Biden administration. The project, originally planned to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco by 2020, is now $100 billion over budget and years behind schedule.</p>

          <p>Marvel's 'Thunderbolts*' is reviewed as a jokey, moody, and middling film that elevates supporting characters from previous movies. The film features Yelena (Florence Pugh), Alexei (David Harbour), Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) as a team of misfits. They are tasked with a mission against corrupt CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). The reviewer notes Pugh's strong performance and the film's punk-rock snark, but ultimately finds it to be a messy and defiant movie with limited visual awe.</p>

The CDC is also stepping up warnings against overuse of vitamin A, which does not cure measles but can reduce the risk of severe illness.</p>
