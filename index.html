          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, following the administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. The changes, implemented after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation, included disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books addressing diversity from Naval Academy libraries. Former West Point teachers criticized these actions as indoctrination, while Trump defended them as removing "Woke Leftist Ideologues." Two protests were planned during the ceremony, highlighting the controversy surrounding the administration's policies and their impact on military education. The article also notes Trump's previous appearance in 2020, which raised concerns about his health. </p>

          <p>AirBnB owners shared their surprise after seeing shirtless Bill Belichick on their doorbell camera footage, initially mistaking him for a "creepy old guy" with a young woman who had booked their property.

The owners also mentioned an interaction with Hudson about playing golf, where she preferred a "men's senior shaft."

One article highlights a mother's unwavering belief in her son's consciousness after a severe brain injury, which science eventually validated. Another explores how individuals with dementia make sense of the world, even when their perception drifts from reality.

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is working to implement police reform and improve community relations. Despite a decline in shootings, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by an officer shortage. O'Hara is focused on restoring pride within the department, adjusting arrest tactics, and enhancing community engagement. He noted that reform efforts will continue even without federal oversight, despite the Justice Department ending investigations and canceling consent decrees. A Minneapolis resident praised the changes, noting that police are using less aggressive tactics and engaging more positively with the community. </p>

Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply.

          <p>Veterinary epidemiologist Stephanie Venn-Watson, initially studying aging dolphins for the U.S. Navy, discovered a unique saturated fatty acid called C15:0 that promotes longevity. Unlike omega-3s, C15:0 improved health outcomes in mammals, leading Venn-Watson to develop a C15:0 supplement and publish a book, "The Longevity Nutrient." This discovery marks the first essential fatty acid found in over ninety years. To increase her intake of C15:0, Venn-Watson consumes certain foods rich in the fatty acid. </p>
