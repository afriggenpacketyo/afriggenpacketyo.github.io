The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was dropped due to an ongoing police investigation, while the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was removed following the announcement of a separate, focused inquiry. This decision has caused shock and concern among families, who fear their experiences will not be heard in the broader review aimed at improving maternity care nationwide across the country.</p>

          <p>British banking giant Barclays has upgraded its full-year financial guidance and announced a surprise £500 million share buyback for investors. The bank now anticipates a return on tangible equity greater than 11% and has increased its net interest income forecast to over £12.6 billion. Despite a 7% year-on-year decline in third-quarter pre-tax profit, which was slightly below expectations, the positive announcements caused the company's shares to rise. The bank's performance was impacted by charges related to the UK's car loan scandal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers chairman Andrew Cavenagh has defended the club's process for appointing new head coach Danny Rohl, admitting that while it may have appeared "clunky" externally, it was not mishandled. Cavenagh confirmed the club engaged with multiple candidates simultaneously, including Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat, before securing Rohl. He clarified that the final decision was influenced by timing and logistics rather than mismanagement by the club's executives, expressing strong satisfaction with the appointment and emphasizing the focus is now on the coach who joined.</p>

          <p>Over 2,000 people gathered at the Christian Democrats' headquarters in Berlin to protest against comments made by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Protesters accused Merz of racism after he linked migration to a "cityscape problem" and suggested a harsh migration policy was necessary to protect women. The rally, organized under the motto "We Are the Daughters," featured speakers who argued that women's safety was being used as a justification for discriminatory narratives. Merz has so far refused to retract his remarks, which have drawn both widespread criticism and support from conservative allies.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone strikes have resulted in the deaths of at least six people, including two children, in various Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the attacks, which also wounded 21 others and targeted energy infrastructure, demonstrate that international pressure on Moscow remains insufficient. The strikes on Kyiv were the first in several weeks, causing fires in residential buildings and killing a couple in their apartment. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military reported a successful strike on a Russian chemical plant in the Bryansk region.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in September for the third consecutive month, a figure cooler than economists had anticipated. This steady but high inflation rate has created uncertainty about whether the Bank of England will proceed with another interest rate cut at its upcoming November meeting. While the data suggests the financial squeeze on consumers is ongoing, it also offers hope that inflation may have peaked below the central bank's forecast.

Prototypes are said to resemble a Mac laptop when closed and open to the size of a 13-inch laptop, but without an external screen.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their season opener to the Golden State Warriors 119-109, despite a stellar performance from Luka Dončić. With LeBron James sidelined by injury for the first season opener of his career, Dončić recorded 43 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists in a heavy-lifting effort. However, the Lakers struggled with turnovers and could not overcome a balanced Warriors attack, which saw four players score in double figures, led by Jimmy Butler with 31 points. The Lakers' poor performance in the third quarter proved decisive in the loss.</p>

          <p>The Spanish soccer league, La Liga, has canceled its controversial plan to stage a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami this December. The decision was made after facing significant opposition from players, some clubs, and fan groups within Spain, creating too much uncertainty to proceed. Game promoter Relevent also cited insufficient time to properly organize an event of this magnitude. While La Liga expressed deep regret over the missed opportunity for international expansion, the move was welcomed by critics who argued that playing a league game abroad would compromise the competition's fairness.</p>

          <p>China's unemployment rate for individuals aged 16 to 24, excluding students, fell slightly to 17.7 percent in September from 18.9 percent in August. Despite the modest improvement, the figure remains high, reflecting ongoing challenges for young job seekers in the country's competitive labor market. The data was released following a record graduation season, which has added further pressure on employment. The situation is exemplified by recent graduates who have struggled to find positions in the public sector despite submitting numerous applications since the beginning of September.</p>

          <p>Following a BBC Panorama undercover investigation that exposed racism and misogyny at a London police station, more than 300 people have contacted the broadcaster with similar allegations. A primary theme in the responses was misogynistic treatment by officers when reporting domestic abuse and sexual violence, with some women describing the experience as being "like being assaulted again." The accounts span multiple police forces across England and include claims of dismissive attitudes and victim-blaming. The National Police Chiefs' Council stated it is working to improve vetting and build a culture of trust.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, mosquitoes have been discovered in Iceland, one of the few places in the world previously free of the insects. An insect enthusiast found several specimens of the Culiseta annulata species in a glacial valley near Reykjavik, a discovery later confirmed by the Icelandic Institute of Natural History. The arrival of mosquitoes is believed to be linked to the country's record-breaking spring temperatures, which may have created more favorable breeding conditions. Scientists are now monitoring to see if the species will become permanently established, marking a significant ecological change.</p>

This move comes shortly after his predecessor, Dina Boluarte, was impeached and removed from office for failing to tackle the same issue. Homicides and violent extortion have been on the rise, with police reporting 1,690 killings between January and September. The government is considering deploying soldiers to assist police and may restrict certain civil liberties, such as freedom of assembly, as part of its new strategy.</p>

The criticism came after Duffy announced that NASA would be open to accepting proposals for moon landers from companies other than Musk's SpaceX to ensure the U.S. wins the "second space race" against China. Musk responded on X, accusing Duffy of "trying to kill NASA" and claiming SpaceX is moving "like lightning" compared to competitors.

          <p>A new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute suggests that a majority of Americans are concerned about President Donald Trump's use of power. When presented with two options, 56% of respondents agreed that Trump is a "potentially dangerous dictator whose power should be limited," compared to 41% who see him as a "strong leader." This margin has nearly doubled since April, indicating growing public apprehension. The findings align with the message of recent "No Kings" rallies and suggest that attempts to dismiss the protesters as extremists may not reflect the views of a significant portion of the electorate.</p>

The addition, which the White House says will cost $250 million and is funded by private donors, is intended to host large official functions.
