          <p>A significant technology outage impacted several major online platforms, including Google, OpenAI, Spotify, and Amazon Web Services, causing disruptions for tens of thousands of users. Reports of issues surged around 2:00 PM EST, peaking approximately 30 minutes later before gradually subsiding for most platforms. Cloudflare indicated that intermittent failures were affecting some of its services, attributing the source of the outage to Google Cloud. While most services were restored by late afternoon, some platforms, such as Ecobee, continued to monitor the situation. The outage affected a wide array of services, ranging from communication and collaboration tools to entertainment and e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>The Marines are set to begin operations in Los Angeles, coordinating with the National Guard in anticipation of nationwide anti-Trump protests. Reportedly, 700 Marines were dispatched by President Trump to Seal Beach for nonlethal weapons training, including hand-to-hand combat and crowd control, before moving to Los Angeles for familiarization training alongside the National Guard. While tasked with protecting federal property and law enforcement, the deployment has drawn criticism due to its estimated $134 million cost to taxpayers. Defense Secretary Hegseth defended the deployment as necessary to maintain law and order and protect law enforcement agents. </p>

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining rape charge after a juror alleged threats from another juror. This development followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. Jurors expressed disappointment at not reaching a verdict on the third-degree sexual assault charge against Jessica Mann, citing one juror's unwillingness to change his mind. The Manhattan District Attorney's office intends to retry the rape charge, with Mann expressing her readiness for a third trial, while Weinstein's team expressed disappointment and suggested a third trial is unnecessary.</p>

The unrest, which began in Ballymena following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, has resulted in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests. In Portadown, a crowd gathered, pulling bricks and masonry from a derelict building to hurl at police, prompting warnings of baton rounds if they did not disperse. Meanwhile, in Ballymena, a heavy police presence remained, but rioters appeared to have stayed away after three nights of violent disorder.</p>

          <p>President Trump cautioned that a "massive conflict" could erupt in the Middle East over Iran's nuclear program if a diplomatic resolution is not reached. He indicated that military strikes are an option if talks fail to curb Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. Trump's warning followed a determination by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran was not complying with its obligations to report all activities in its nuclear facilities. Tensions have risen as Iran announced the launch of a new enrichment facility, prompting the State Department to evacuate staff from its embassy in Baghdad and the military to evacuate non-essential personnel from U.S. military bases in the Middle East.</p>

Critics argue that the money could be better spent on supporting military families or medical research.

This statement contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized that allowing Chinese nationals to study in the US is beneficial for both the students and the country, particularly for American schools and companies. He also noted that preventing them from staying would lead to them starting businesses in their home countries instead.</p>

          <p>Amid a US-China trade truce, negotiators in London reached a “framework” agreement to activate the Geneva deal, raising hopes for an immediate alleviation of the trade conflict, including potentially a US commitment to revoke some of its tech embargoes in return for China’s relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. The full details of the London agreement are expected to be available after both US President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping have approved it. China unprecedentedly tightened its rare earth exports , displaying its ability to retaliate. The pain inflicted on US car manufacturers and defence companies was obviously the most pressing reason for Trump to talk to Xi, as the trade tussle was rapidly escalating into a crisis of global supply chains.</p>

          <p>A federal hearing is scheduled to address California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. California Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they call the administration's "unnecessary" and "unlawful militarization." The state seeks to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines beyond protecting federal buildings and property. The Department of Justice argues that limiting the military's role would amount to a "rioters' veto" to the enforcement of federal law.</p>

Senator Ted Cruz has advocated ending this power as a cost-saving measure for the federal government, estimating potential savings of $1 trillion. The Fed's ability to pay interest, established in 2008, is essential for managing interest rates amid substantial liquidity created by bond-buying stimulus efforts. The Fed currently pays banks 4.4% on reserves and uses reverse repo facilities to manage cash flow, ensuring the federal funds rate remains within the desired range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing wildfire in Oregon has destroyed multiple homes and prompted evacuation orders in the Columbia River Gorge area, serving as an early warning for the fire season. The Rowena fire has expanded to 3,500 acres with 0% containment, leading to evacuation orders for hundreds of homes and a temporary closure of a section of Interstate 84. Governor Kotek invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act to mobilize resources, including an incident management team and structural taskforces. With the US West bracing for a potentially severe fire season due to a dry winter and rising temperatures, the incident underscores the need for preparedness.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in Nairobi, Kenya, following the death of blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody. Ojwang was arrested after criticizing a police official on social media and later died under suspicious circumstances, with an autopsy revealing evidence of torture. The incident has sparked public anger and distrust in the police force, leading to demonstrations where protesters blocked roads and clashed with riot police. The unrest has prompted apologies from Kenya's police chief and condemnation from President Ruto, as well as calls for a transparent investigation from international entities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les Misérables' at the Kennedy Center, an event that coincided with ongoing protests against his administration's immigration policies. The musical, which is critical of autocracy and champions the rights of protesters, presented a stark contrast to Trump's actions, including the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to demonstrations. Trump's presence at the performance, which also served as a fundraiser, drew criticism and highlighted the irony of his appreciation for a story that challenges unchecked power and celebrates social justice.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reveals that the Republican tax bill would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans while negatively impacting the poorest. The analysis indicates that the lowest-income households would lose approximately $1,600 annually, while the wealthiest would gain an average of $12,000 per year. These cuts to lower-income households are attributed to proposed reductions in social safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP. The CBO analysis considers the tax bill in isolation, excluding the potential impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
