          <p>Cease-fire negotiations between Hamas and Israel have reached a standstill due to long-standing disagreements. For the past 18 months, Hamas has advocated for a permanent truce, while Israel has insisted on a temporary one. This significant divergence in their positions has consistently thwarted efforts to bring an end to the ongoing conflict. The lack of a middle ground continues to prolong the war, leaving both sides entrenched in their respective demands and unable to reach a resolution.</p>

          <p>Representatives from Russia and Ukraine convened in Istanbul for another round of cease-fire negotiations, though hopes for a significant breakthrough remain subdued. The two sides have been engaged in conflict for over three years, and previous talks have yielded little progress. The meeting occurs against a backdrop of escalating attacks, including a major drone assault by Ukraine on Russian bombers and continued shelling in Ukrainian territories. The wide gap in positions and maximalist war goals of Putin continue to be a barrier for a lasting resolution.</p>

          <p>A Swedish commission has called for an end to international adoptions after uncovering widespread abuse and fraud spanning several decades. The investigation found cases of child trafficking, adoption without parental consent, and false declarations of death. The Swedish government was aware of these issues early on but prioritized facilitating adoptions from abroad. The commission urged the government to issue a formal apology to adoptees and their families, emphasizing the need to raise awareness about the human rights violations that have occurred.</p>

The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes over UK airspace, many of which were established 70 years ago. The initial focus will be on modernizing airspace in and around London, with changes expected in the 2030s. While ministers say the plans could allow planes to climb quicker and descend more smoothly, concerns have been raised about new flight paths affecting previously unaffected areas.</p>
