          <p>The Reform UK party has announced a proposal to eliminate Indefinite Leave to Remain, which allows migrants to settle permanently in the UK after five years. Under the plan, migrants would need to reapply for visas under stricter criteria, including higher salary and English language thresholds, and would be barred from accessing welfare benefits. The party claims this policy would save billions, a figure disputed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, while critics argue it would create immense uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of families and face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>An inquest has concluded that former England rugby international Tom Voyce died accidentally after being nearly three times over the drink-drive limit. His vehicle was washed into a flooded river in Northumberland during a storm, with the coroner noting that high water levels may have made the dangerous ford appear deceptively flat. While his intoxication would have impaired judgment, the pathologist stated it was not a direct cause of death. The coroner will suggest safety improvements for the crossing to local authorities.</p>

The National Hurricane Center warns that swells generated by the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward and into Atlantic Canada through the early part of the week.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Victoria Beckham described her family as more traditional than people might realize, emphasizing the importance of shared family time and supporting one another's endeavors. She explained that she prioritized being present for family dinners even when it meant returning to work afterward and believes it's healthy for her children to see both parents dedicated to their careers. The article also touches upon persistent rumors of a rift between the family and their eldest son, Brooklyn, and his wife, Nicola Peltz, which the family has previously downplayed.</p>

          <p>Official data from August shows a decline in China's rare earth permanent magnet exports to the United States, its second-largest market. Shipments to the U.S. fell by 5% compared to July and 12% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing uncertainty from the trade war between the two nations. In contrast, China's overall global exports of these critical components reached their highest monthly total since January, driven by a significant increase in demand from the European Union as companies there seek to secure their supply chains.</p>

          <p>This article examines the enduring popularity of the self-help industry, a market valued at over $45 billion that encompasses books, courses, and digital content. Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro notes that while the genre has evolved to include more research-backed authors like Brené Brown, its core appeal remains the promise of self-betterment. However, the article questions whether the intense focus on individual optimization and productivity is healthy, suggesting that it may lead to isolation by neglecting the crucial role of community and interpersonal relationships in personal well-being.</p>

The displays of support, including protests and speeches, reflect a strong pro-Palestinian sentiment prevalent across Spain and at its cultural events.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid downplayed a second consecutive week of sideline confrontations with tight end Travis Kelce, stating that he loves his player's passion. During the Chiefs' victory over the Giants, Reid and Kelce were seen in a heated exchange, similar to an incident the previous week. Reid suggested the team needed more of that emotional energy and praised Kelce's all-in attitude, noting his own role is sometimes to be the "policeman." Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also affirmed the strong relationship between the coach and star player.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging President Donald Trump to support an international proposal to raise the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. In a letter, Cruz argued that the current policy forces thousands of experienced pilots into early retirement annually and that the U.S. should lead the effort for the change at an upcoming UN aviation meeting. The proposal is opposed by the Air Line Pilots Association, which cites health risks and potential cognitive decline in older pilots as safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Christian Horner has officially left his role as team principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team after being dismissed in July. While the team's statement did not disclose figures, sources report he received a severance package of around £52 million. Horner's departure follows a controversial period that began with allegations of sexual harassment, of which he was twice cleared. The turmoil exposed a power struggle within the team, leading to the exit of several key figures, including legendary designer Adrian Newey, amid a decline in the team's performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to advise pregnant women to limit their use of Tylenol (acetaminophen), linking the pain reliever to rising rates of autism. This follows a statement from the President that an "amazing" announcement on the cause of autism was forthcoming. While some studies have suggested a correlation, the scientific evidence is inconsistent and does not prove causation, with major medical groups still considering acetaminophen one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women. Tylenol's manufacturer strongly disputes any link to autism.</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the long-held narrative that marriage and two-parent households are the primary solution to racial inequality. Her research reveals that Black children raised in two-parent families still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts in education and employment outcomes. The book argues that this is due to persistent structural racism and vast disparities in wealth and resources, suggesting that policy focus should shift from marriage promotion to addressing these deeper systemic issues.</p>
