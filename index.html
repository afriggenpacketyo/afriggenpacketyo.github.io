          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, has been indicted on federal criminal charges in the U.S. The indictment, filed in Nashville, accuses Abrego Garcia of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Abrego Garcia had previously been granted legal status that protected him from deportation to El Salvador due to the risk of persecution by local gangs. This case has sparked considerable controversy, with critics arguing that the prosecution is politically motivated and a violation of Abrego Garcia's due process rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to improve drone detection and crack down on unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling, with a particular focus on protecting large-scale public events like the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to boost U.S. development of drones and commercial use of the technology for deliveries and other purposes. The initiative is driven by concerns highlighted by drone strikes in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <h2>Economist Warns of 'Cracks in the Foundation' of the Job Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist warns that despite seemingly stable U.S. job market reports, there are underlying 'cracks in the foundation' that could negatively impact workers. The economy has been netting an average of 144,000 new jobs monthly, the lowest since 2011 excluding the pandemic era. Available positions are primarily in health care, leisure, and hospitality, but new tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' could limit growth in these sectors. Cuts to Medicaid and increased difficulty in accessing Affordable Care Act plans could hinder job growth in the healthcare sector (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The interim government of Bangladesh has announced that the next general election will be held in the first half of April 2026.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's actions are rooted in anti-managerialism, a political ideology that views a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats as having usurped democracy. This idea, once marginalized, has become central to the new right and drives efforts to transform institutions from government to corporations. While success has been limited, understanding this anti-managerialism is crucial for understanding the administration's efforts to reshape America's institutional landscape. This perspective offers a deeper understanding of the motivations behind many of the administration's policies and actions.</p>
