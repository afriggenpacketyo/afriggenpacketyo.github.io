          <p>The European Union has levied substantial fines against Apple and Meta for breaching the bloc's digital competition laws. Apple faces a €500 million fine for restricting developers from informing customers about alternative offers outside the App Store, while Meta is fined €200 million for requiring users to consent to data sharing or pay for an ad-free service. Both companies plan to appeal the decisions, arguing that the EU is unfairly targeting American businesses. The EU's actions risk retaliation from the U.S., highlighting ongoing tensions over the regulation of digital giants and the potential for trade conflicts.</p>

          <p>Measure A oversight panels have established five-year goals with metrics to evaluate the success of the half-cent homelessness sales tax. The targets include reducing the number of people who become homeless each year and increasing the number leaving encampments. The Leadership Table for Regional Homeless Alignment, a panel of service providers, experts, and formerly homeless individuals, has developed concrete targets based on data from county agencies. These goals aim for achievable progress rather than sweeping claims of ending homelessness.</p>
