          <p>A new vaccine advisory committee, appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted to recommend against the use of the preservative thimerosal in flu vaccines, despite its rare usage and established safety record. This move has drawn criticism from groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics for potentially sowing public distrust. The committee also approved a new RSV shot for newborns, adding another option for protecting infants, though some new members voiced concerns that were at odds with FDA and CDC reviews.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reportedly dismissed Omead Afshar, the company's vice president of manufacturing and operations.

          <p>The Trump administration's claims about the success of recent airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities are being compared to the "stovepiping" of intelligence seen before the 2003 Iraq war. This analysis suggests that President Trump and his senior officials are prioritizing their own narrative and "instincts" over formal assessments from agencies like the Defense Intelligence Agency. By demanding loyalty to the official line that the facilities were "obliterated," the administration is allegedly undermining the credibility of the U.S. intelligence community and discouraging objective analysis, creating a significant risk for international security.</p>

          <p>Shares of backup-generator manufacturer Generac are experiencing a significant rally, marking their best week since last November. This surge is attributed to a combination of an oppressive heat wave across the central and eastern U.S., which has caused power outages, and forecasts for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. The increased demand and strain on the nation's aging power grid are seen as major drivers for the company's positive performance, as consumers and investors anticipate a greater need for backup power solutions.

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's self-imposed July deadlines for finalizing trade deals and imposing new tariffs are not rigid. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the dates are "not critical" and could potentially be extended, a decision that rests with the president. This flexibility applies to a delayed 50% tariff threat on the European Union and the expiration of a pause on broader "reciprocal" tariffs.

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced a halt to all U.S. funding for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, accusing the organization of neglecting vaccine safety. This move has been met with shock and condemnation from public health experts and philanthropists like Bill Gates, who warned of "devastating consequences" and millions of preventable deaths. Gavi, which has helped vaccinate over a billion children in low-income countries, now faces a significant funding gap as the U.S. was one of its largest government donors.</p>

          <p>Top executives from major Chinese energy corporations have called on Brazil to establish a stable and predictable regulatory framework, warning that continued delays could jeopardize billions in potential green energy investments. Speaking at an energy summit, representatives from SPIC and CEEC highlighted the lack of clear rules for energy storage and long-term concessions as significant hurdles. China has become a major investor in Brazil's energy sector, particularly in wind and solar technologies, but executives stressed that capital and interest require a more certain legal environment.</p>

          <p>In a significant decision, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has ruled that Medicaid patients cannot sue states in federal court to enforce their right to choose their own healthcare provider. The case, *Medina v. Planned Parenthood*, involved South Carolina's attempt to block Medicaid funding for the organization. This ruling, authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, is seen as a major blow to patient rights and could render many provisions of federal Medicaid law unenforceable, potentially impacting access to care for millions of low-income Americans beyond the specific context of abortion providers.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, some Republican groups and figures are calling on the Trump administration to revoke his U.S. citizenship and deport him. The New York Young Republican Club cited the Red Scare-era Communist Control Act as a basis for this action against the self-proclaimed socialist. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, has dismissed the calls as an attack on immigrants and urged his critics to read the Constitution.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from TransUnion reveals that a record 31% of federal student loan borrowers with a payment due are now more than 90 days late, signaling an impending "default cliff."

Immigration attorneys note that the plan to replace the existing EB-5 visa program would require congressional approval. Furthermore, a key featureâ€”exempting cardholders from taxes on their worldwide incomeâ€”would create an unprecedented tax status and require complex changes to the U.S. tax code. While the administration touts high demand, experts believe the actual market is much smaller and dependent on these unresolved issues.</p>
