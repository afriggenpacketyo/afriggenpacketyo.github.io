          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sits down for an in-depth interview, sharing his family's personal story of fleeing the Iranian revolution and losing everything, which he says shaped his perspective. He addresses his tenure at Uber, which began in 2017 with the difficult task of cleaning up a notoriously toxic corporate culture, stating the company is now getting it right more often. Khosrowshahi also discusses navigating the current political climate under President Trump, the economic pressures leading to higher ride costs, and his own concerns about wealth inequality.

          <p>An early morning fire and explosion caused three rowhome buildings to collapse in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood, hospitalizing two elderly women, one of whom is in critical condition. The powerful blast, which residents described as a "big bang," damaged adjacent properties and forced evacuations due to the risk of further collapses. Officials have initiated a large-scale search and rescue operation, with multiple agencies including the ATF investigating the cause of the explosion. The American Red Cross is on-site to provide assistance to displaced residents affected by the widespread destruction and property damage in the area.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival organizers have stated they are "appalled" by comments made by the punk duo Bob Vylan, who led chants calling for the death of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during a performance. The festival and organizer Emily Eavis issued a joint statement condemning the remarks as having "crossed a line," while reaffirming their stance against all forms of terrorism and hate speech. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the comments "revolting," noting the irony that Israelis were attacked, sexually assaulted, and in some cases are still being held captive at a music festival. The BBC, which broadcast the set, has faced criticism and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service.</p>

          <p>In an interview, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes caused "very serious" damage to Iran's nuclear facilities but did not eliminate its capabilities. He estimates that Iran could resume enriching uranium in a matter of months, as the country's knowledge and industrial capacity remain intact. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic engagement and the return of IAEA inspectors to verify the status of Iran's nuclear material and activities. He stressed that a long-term solution to the nuclear issue can only be achieved through diplomacy, not military action.</p>

Jeffries mentioned that their congressional districts do not overlap and he has never had a significant discussion with Mamdani.

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to partner in tackling obesity by making healthy food more appealing and accessible. Under the strategy, retailers will be encouraged to use methods like promotions on healthy items, loyalty point incentives, or altered store layouts to guide consumers toward better choices. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized this is a collaborative approach, not a "nanny state" dictation of what people should buy. The initiative aims to reduce obesity, particularly in children, and alleviate the estimated Â£11 billion annual cost to the NHS, responding to reports that healthy food is often significantly more expensive than less healthy options.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced President Trump's extensive tax-cut and spending package after a tense, late-night procedural vote that passed 51-49. Republican leaders, including Vice President J.D. Vance, engaged in hours of negotiations to secure the votes of several conservative holdouts concerned about the bill's impact on the national debt. The legislation aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and boost funding for military and border security, but faces strong opposition from Democrats who argue it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The bill also drew criticism from Elon Musk, who claimed the Senate draft would harm industries of the future while propping up those of the past.</p>

          <p>Approximately 12,000 Chinese immigrants in Taiwan are facing a government deadline to provide proof that they have canceled their household registration in mainland China or risk losing their Taiwanese residency and potential deportation. This measure is part of a broader push by President Lai Ching-te's administration to bolster national security against Chinese influence. The policy primarily affects Chinese-born spouses of Taiwanese citizens and their children, many of whom have lived in Taiwan for decades. The requirement has caused significant distress, forcing individuals to navigate Chinese bureaucracy and submit sensitive information, sparking a debate about fairness, national security, and the potential to stigmatize a vulnerable community.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, many people in unhappy relationships fail to recognize their situation due to unhealthy habits like emotional suppression or normalizing problems. The article suggests asking four key questions to assess relationship health: Do you feel like a team during conflict? Can you be your authentic self? Is your partner curious about your inner world? Do they take accountability for mistakes? Answering "no" to these questions may indicate underlying dissatisfaction. Healthy relationships are characterized by collaborative problem-solving, the freedom to be genuine, sustained curiosity about each other, and a mutual commitment to owning up to errors and making amends.</p>

          <p>BeyoncÃ© is facing significant backlash for wearing a T-shirt during a performance that featured a description of the historic Buffalo Soldiers, labeling their adversaries as "warring Indians" and "Mexican revolutionaries." Indigenous influencers and fans have criticized the pop star on social media for promoting anti-Indigenous language and a one-sided historical narrative that overlooks the soldiers' role in the subjugation of Native peoples during U.S. westward expansion. The controversy highlights a broader cultural debate about reclaiming American history and iconography, with critics arguing that framing the Buffalo Soldiers' story without acknowledging its complex and violent aspects reinforces harmful nationalist myths at the expense of marginalized communities.</p>

Patients, like one whose participation in a trial was delayed due to layoffs, express devastation, questioning why cancer research has become a political issue.

The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with voter concerns over inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty.

The piece posits that for Gen Z, sex is deeply intertwined with politics, identity, and a rejection of traditional gendered expectations. Having grown up post-#MeToo and post-Roe, many young people view sexual freedom as a political battleground and are more inclusive in their definitions of sex, moving beyond heteronormative concepts like virginity. This generation's activism and re-evaluation of sexual norms are presented as a progressive force, challenging conservative efforts to restrict sexual and reproductive freedoms.</p>

Jain finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and sees execution as beneath them, as startups lack the luxury of having separate roles for these functions.

          <p>A new report from asset management firm Vanguard reveals a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, the median balance for workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 is nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, the data shows persistent progress in retirement saving behaviors, with many Americans prioritizing long-term financial goals. The study also highlights the effectiveness of automatic enrollment, as employees in such plans for over ten years have median balances approximately 60% higher than those who had to voluntarily opt-in.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of "sludge," the intentional creation of bureaucratic friction, as a core strategy in modern customer service. Through a personal narrative involving a defective car and a maddening warranty claim, the author reveals how companies design systems to defeat customers through endless holds, transfers, and illogical processes. Industry insiders confirm that these tactics, such as making it difficult to reach a helpful agent or using poor-quality call connections, are often deliberate to reduce expensive payouts and refunds. This systemic frustration is contributing to widespread consumer rage and a growing distrust in institutions, as people are exhausted into a state of simply giving up.</p>

While the business is not yet profitable, the income from guests helps cover the chateau's significant running costs, allowing the couple to live off their savings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that many liberals are in a "misinformation bubble" regarding youth gender medicine, unaware that core arguments, such as medical transition preventing suicide, are not supported by strong evidence. The author points to a recent admission by an ACLU lawyer before the Supreme Court that no studies prove transition reduces completed suicides. The piece criticizes organizations like WPATH for allegedly suppressing research that doesn't support their preferred outcomes and for fostering a climate where debate is stifled. It suggests that the political polarization of the issue in the U.S. has prevented an honest appraisal of the weak evidence base, which has been acknowledged more openly in European reviews like the Cass report.</p>

If either visit occurs, it would mark the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Trump's second term began.

Despite being reinstated by a court order, she and the remaining staff face a crippled agency, unable to perform its duties.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concerns from over 120 MPs led to a stronger final package. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and reversing a plan to freeze the health-related component of Universal Credit. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the U-turn, suggesting the bill will now pass, though the episode has raised questions about the Prime Minister's ability to manage his party.</p>

Now, the Trump administration is wielding Title VI to investigate anti-Semitism and DEI programs, making sweeping demands on university governance, disciplinary actions, and curriculum under the threat of losing federal funding.

While these services offer interest-free, short-term loans, they also encourage impulsive spending and are leading to rising consumer defaults.

Kennedy Jr. This situation is causing confusion and concern among legal and public health experts, especially after Kennedy dismissed independent vaccine advisers and appointed new ones with anti-vaccine histories. Complicating matters, Kennedy testified that another official is running the agency, a claim legal experts say is not possible under federal law. This lack of clear, lawful leadership could expose the agency's actions to legal challenges and undermines trust in its scientific processes.</p>
