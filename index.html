        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EPA intends to revise the drinking water limits for certain PFAS, commonly known as 'forever chemicals,' that were established the previous year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered, while utilities will get two extra years to comply with PFOA and PFOS standards. Health advocates criticize the move, arguing it violates the Safe Water Drinking Act, while water utilities argue that the original treatment systems are expensive. The article outlines the ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding PFAS regulation and its impact on public health and water utility costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's increasingly hostile stance towards South Africa is fueled by several factors, including meetings with Afrikaner activists and disagreements over Israel's actions in Gaza. The administration has halted foreign aid to South Africa and prioritized Afrikaner refugees, citing racial discrimination. Influenced by hard-right conservatives and Elon Musk's claims of a 'genocide of white people,' Trump's policies reflect a focus on white victimhood and a cautionary view of South Africa's racial dynamics.

          <p>Forty years after the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia, many feel the city has not adequately addressed the tragedy or remembered the victims. On May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on a rowhome occupied by MOVE, a Black liberation group, resulting in 11 deaths, including five children. The city was faulted for its handling of the incident, and the MOVE Commission described the decision to bomb the home as 'unconscionable.'
