          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. This extension, formalized by a presidential executive order, maintains the current tariff rates of 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% on American goods entering China. The additional time is intended to facilitate further negotiations on resolving trade imbalances, unfair practices, and other economic and national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two nations have already seen a considerable decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple explosions at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant near Pittsburgh resulted in the deaths of two employees and injuries to at least ten others. The incident, which occurred at the nation's largest coke manufacturing facility, prompted a large-scale emergency response from numerous local fire and EMS departments. Following a search and rescue operation, officials confirmed the recovery of the last missing worker's body. The plant has since been stabilized, and an investigation into the cause of the explosions is underway, involving agencies like the ATF.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to pursue a new venture as a founder. His departure comes as GitHub faces intensified competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Replit, which are rapidly gaining market share. Under Dohmke's leadership, GitHub launched the popular Copilot tool and saw its developer base more than double to 150 million. The company has not yet named a successor, and its leadership team will now report to an executive within Microsoft's CoreAI division.</p>

Sturgeon also writes about personal challenges, including suffering a miscarriage, the end of her marriage, and facing misogyny in politics.

Musk alleges that Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, specifically questioning why his xAI's Grok chatbot is not featured more prominently. This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the operating system level, which he had called an "unacceptable security violation."

The move has drawn concern from some economists and former BLS leaders, who warn it could undermine the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system. Antoni's appointment requires Senate confirmation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for a balanced approach to regulating the country's fiercely competitive "quick commerce" market. He argued that instead of stifling competition, the government should guide the sector away from excessive cash burn and zero-sum tactics. Wang emphasized that rapid delivery services create new consumption opportunities that are vital for long-term economic growth. The goal, he suggested, should be to foster a healthier industrial ecosystem through innovation and quality improvements rather than simply curbing competitive practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic frames President Trump's federalization of the D.C. police and deployment of the National Guard as a significant step towards authoritarianism. The article argues the move is based on misleading crime statistics and serves as a public relations stunt rather than an effective crime-fighting strategy. It points out the irony of conservatives, who previously accused Democrats of creating a "police state," now supporting this action. The author warns that this sets a dangerous precedent for the president to deploy armed forces in American cities under the pretext of spurious emergencies.</p>

The agreement requires the semiconductor giants to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Cramer noted that the revenue goes to the Treasury and compared it to past government interventions, such as the Chrysler bailout. He argued that while the "pay-to-play" element is debatable, the decision to allow the sales is ultimately beneficial for the companies and taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado is battling several large wildfires, including the Lee fire, which has become the fifth largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres. More than a thousand firefighters have been deployed to combat the blazes, which are being fueled by gusty winds, low humidity, and extremely dry conditions. The severe weather is causing extreme fire behavior, and evacuation orders are in place for several mountain communities. Governor Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency to support the response efforts, as smoke from the fires triggers air quality warnings across the region.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Reveals Trump's Justification for D.C. Takeover Relies on Misleading Crime Data</h2>

          <p>An investigation into President Trump's claims about crime in Washington D.C. shows his justification for federalizing the city's police is based on false and misleading narratives. While Trump cited 2023 statistics, recent data from 2024 and 2025 shows that violent crime in the city has fallen dramatically, reaching a 30-year low. The article points out that other cities Trump has targeted, such as Los Angeles and Baltimore, have also seen significant crime reductions. Experts quoted in the article suggest that community-led interventions, not punitive crackdowns, have been more effective at reducing youth violence.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI research, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse. In a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission, they cite "serious and escalating concerns," including a "toxic internal culture" and misuse of public funds. The crisis was reportedly triggered by the UK's Technology Secretary, who threatened to withdraw the institute's £100m grant unless it pivots its focus to defense and national security research. The government stated it wants the institute to deliver better value for taxpayers.</p>

          <p>England footballer Jess Carter revealed she felt a "sigh of relief" when white teammates also missed penalties in a Euro 2025 shootout, fearing Lauren James, who is Black, would have faced "astronomical" racist abuse if she were the only one. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke about the devastating psychological impact of the abuse, saying it made her feel "scared to play." The Football Association has referred the abuse to the police, and Carter highlighted how the experience made her feel small, invaluable, and deeply affected her family.</p>

          <p>The three-year-long mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved after the killer's new girlfriend went to the police. Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he and his brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker. She later contacted authorities, leading them to discover Parsons' remains. The victim's family expressed immense gratitude for her actions, stating his body likely would never have been found otherwise.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old Kentucky man wanted in connection with armed robberies was arrested in Montgomery County, Ohio, after being found hiding in a sewer drain. The arrest followed a police chase that began when officers spotted a stolen vehicle, which then crashed. The suspect, Trevor Walker, fled on foot, prompting a large search and a shelter-in-place advisory for the area after firearms were found in the vehicle. A SWAT team eventually located Walker soaked in water inside the drain and convinced him to surrender, bringing a tense situation to a safe conclusion.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin suggests the focus is a bilateral power play that leaves Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy marginalized. Trump has ruled out a trilateral meeting and framed the talks as a "feel out" meeting to explore a potential deal, likely involving land concessions. The article notes Trump's confidence in his deal-making ability, boasting he will know within minutes if an agreement is possible. A telling gaffe, where Trump mistakenly said he was "going to Russia," is interpreted as revealing how central Putin is to his political and diplomatic narrative.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his position on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting at the White House, just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The initial call for resignation came after a senator raised questions about Tan's ties to China. Following a "candid and constructive discussion" with Trump and cabinet members, the president praised Tan's story and announced they would bring suggestions to him. This shift in tone highlights the administration's active and sometimes volatile involvement in the semiconductor industry amid the ongoing tech competition with China.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, but the terms are less exclusive than their original 2020 agreement. The new "first-look" deal gives Netflix the first option on their film and television projects, but does not cover overhead costs or grant exclusive rights to all content developed. The partnership has so far produced several successful documentary and reality series, including "Harry & Meghan" and the culinary show "With Love, Meghan." The new deal also encompasses Meghan's lifestyle brand, "As ever."</p>
