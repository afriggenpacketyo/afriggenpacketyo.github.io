          <p>Car dealerships across China are experiencing a severe financial downturn due to an ongoing price war and increasing competition from e-commerce platforms. According to the China Passenger Car Association, the 14 largest dealership groups saw a 10% sales decline in the first half of 2025, following an 18% drop in 2024. Many dealers are operating at significant losses and struggling with negative cash flow, prompting calls for financial support from banks to stabilize the market. The industry faces a grim outlook, with predictions that many businesses could fail within two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border management tool, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will affect non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires passengers to register biometric data like fingerprints and a facial photo upon their first entry into the Schengen Area. While designed to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial registration phase. The EES is being phased in over six months, with full implementation across all 29 participating countries expected by April 2026.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the next World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to rectify the team's failure to defeat Ukraine in the 2022 playoffs. Clarke, who successfully led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, still feels the sting of the 3-1 loss at Hampden that ended their hopes for a spot in Qatar. He emphasized that while the defeat was a significant disappointment, especially given the unusual circumstances of the rescheduled match, the team is now focused on putting that result right in the current campaign.</p>

          <p>A year after being violently assaulted, Deutsche Welle reporter Adonis Alkhaled is still awaiting the results of a police investigation into the attack. The incident occurred at a concert in Düsseldorf, Germany, where Alkhaled was allegedly beaten by men appearing to be bodyguards for Syrian hip-hop artist Al Shami. Despite video footage of the assault and widespread condemnation from media organizations and government officials, the investigation into the unknown assailants remains ongoing. Alkhaled has expressed frustration with the slow pace of the investigation, having provided authorities with information he gathered himself about potential suspects.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein has sparked a public debate over religious holidays after it formalized the option for Muslim students and employees to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic festivals. Despite media headlines suggesting new entitlements, the regulation merely clarifies an existing practice rooted in Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom, similar to provisions for other non-Christian faiths. The policy does not grant extra paid holidays but allows individuals to observe significant religious days without penalty. This reflects a broader national conversation in Germany about integration and equality in a culturally diverse society.</p>

          <p>The Philippines has accused a Chinese Coast Guard ship of intentionally ramming one of its government vessels and using water cannons against it near Thitu Island in the disputed South China Sea. The Philippine Coast Guard stated the incident occurred while its ships were anchored to protect local fishermen, describing the actions as a clear threat from Beijing. China's Coast Guard countered, claiming the Philippine vessels illegally entered its waters and dangerously approached their ship, causing the collision.

The incident highlights a broader issue of unnecessary packaging in supermarkets, which contributes to landfill pollution and passes extra costs to consumers. While some grocery chains are making efforts to adopt sustainable practices, such as using biodegradable materials and donating unsold food, critics argue that much more needs to be done to eliminate packaging waste.</p>

          <p>The emergence of a damaging email has intensified pressure on the British Royal Family regarding Prince Andrew, but King Charles's options for action are limited. The email suggests Andrew maintained contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he publicly claimed. While there are calls to strip Andrew of his titles or evict him from his Royal Lodge residence, such actions face legal and practical hurdles. Prince Andrew has already lost his HRH title and official duties, and the Palace has subtly sidelined him from public events, a strategy that is likely to continue as the family navigates the persistent reputational damage.</p>

          <p>Walk-on running back King Miller had a breakout performance, rushing for 148 yards to lead the USC Trojans to a decisive 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan. Miller, a redshirt freshman, stepped up after USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries. His long, breakaway runs in the third quarter were instrumental in securing the win, which marks a significant achievement for coach Lincoln Riley against a ranked opponent. The victory was defined by USC's physical dominance on both the offensive and defensive lines, challenging perceptions of the team's toughness.</p>

The victory was particularly significant as it came against their rivals, now managed by former Brewers manager Craig Counsell. Milwaukee will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, with Game 1 scheduled to be played in Milwaukee.</p>

          <p>Alison Davis, an Indiana woman accused of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, has been found not guilty after a lengthy trial. Initially, authorities believed Kevin's death was a tragic accident from falling down the stairs, but an autopsy revealed multiple skull fractures inconsistent with a simple fall, leading to Alison's arrest. The prosecution argued she beat him to death, while the defense maintained he sustained the fatal injuries by hitting a banister post during an accidental fall. The jury acquitted Alison after 17 months of incarceration, citing holes in the prosecution's case, which lacked a murder weapon or clear motive.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series, a team that has excelled this season despite a modest payroll. The Brewers' success is built on a small-ball offensive approach that prioritizes getting on base and manufacturing runs, rather than relying on home runs. Their pitching staff ranked second in the majors in team ERA, anchored by ace Freddy Peralta and a deep, effective bullpen. Managed by former college coach Pat Murphy, the Brewers swept the Dodgers in six games during the regular season, presenting a formidable challenge for Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, the former superintendent of Los Angeles schools, is planning to run for mayor in 2026, challenging incumbent Karen Bass. Beutner is highly critical of the city's response to several crises, particularly the devastating Palisades fire, which he argues demonstrated a "failure of leadership" from the mayor's office. As a philanthropist and former investment banker, Beutner represents the first serious challenger to Bass, potentially setting the stage for a competitive election. He aims to address what he describes as a city adrift, citing issues with crime, housing affordability, and emergency preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. military personnel receive their pay on schedule, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The directive aims to prevent troops from missing their paychecks as other government employees are furloughed or working without pay. The shutdown began after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on a spending plan, with each party blaming the other for the impasse. The Trump administration has also begun laying off thousands of federal workers, an unprecedented move during a shutdown, to pressure Democrats and reduce the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, is airing a new television series titled "Silent Honour," which for the first time dramatizes the Communist Party's clandestine espionage activities in Taiwan. The 39-episode drama chronicles the covert operations that began as the defeated Kuomintang (KMT) retreated to the island in 1949. These missions were ultimately crushed by the KMT, resulting in the execution of many agents, a topic rarely acknowledged in mainland China. The series, produced under state guidance, premiered on Martyrs' Day, signaling a potential shift in Beijing's willingness to commemorate this chapter of its history.</p>
