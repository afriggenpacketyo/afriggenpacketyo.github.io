          <p>Following the release of data showing the U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter, President Trump attributed the downturn to his predecessor, Joe Biden, citing a 'Biden Overhang'. Trump defended his tariff policies and assured Americans that the economy would soon boom once Biden's influence was removed. He pointed to companies moving into the USA in record numbers due to tariffs, despite experts attributing the economic uncertainty to these same policies. The report also indicated a sharp increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, contradicting Trump's claims of decreasing prices.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student who was detained by immigration authorities during his U.S. citizenship interview, has been released following a federal judge's order. Mahdawi's attorneys argued that the Trump administration was attempting to deport him in retaliation for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia's campus during the Israel-Hamas war, violating his First Amendment rights. The student's detention sparked concerns about the administration's targeting of activists and its impact on freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Syria targeting what it described as 'operatives' south of Damascus, accusing them of attacking Druse civilians, amidst escalating sectarian violence in the region. The strikes followed clashes between pro-government fighters and Druse militiamen near Ashrafieh Sahnaya, a largely Druse area south of Damascus. The violence was sparked by an audio clip purportedly showing a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad, raising fears among Syria's diverse ethnic and religious minorities about persecution under the new Islamist leadership that took over after Bashar al-Assad's ouster. Israel has offered to protect the Druse in Syria, a move rejected by many Syrian Druse.</p>

          <p>President Emmanuel Macron, often perceived as distant, is attempting to connect with the French public by making unannounced visits to local bars, particularly 'PMU bar-tabacs' in small towns and villages. During a recent visit to Le Prem’s, Macron chatted with locals about their concerns regarding healthcare, jobs, and salaries. This effort is part of Macron's broader push for a rebirth, aiming to reassure citizens worried about global issues and the cost of living, especially in the 'périphérie' where feelings of abandonment have led voters to reject mainstream parties. With two years left in his presidency, Macron hopes to overcome his 'Jupiter' image and forge a stronger bond with the French people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US economy experienced an unforeseen contraction of 0.3% in the first three months of President Trump's second term, according to preliminary data. The downturn was largely attributed to a surge in imports as businesses and consumers stockpiled goods in anticipation of future tariffs, along with a deceleration in consumer spending and a downturn in government spending. Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the negative economic news, while analysts warned that the administration's trade and immigration policies could further dent economic growth. The report raised concerns about a potential US slowdown amid a global trade war.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attempting to distance himself from the stock market's recent performance, attributing a decrease of 0.3% in the first quarter to his predecessor, Joe Biden. He asserts that his tariff policies will soon stimulate the economy, leading to a boom. This attempt to shift blame contrasts with his previous efforts to take credit for the stock market's rise during the Biden administration. The S&P 500 has declined significantly during the first 100 days of Trump's second term, marking one of the worst performances since 1945.</p>

          <p>Richard Burrows, an 81-year-old paedophile who spent nearly three decades on the run in Thailand, has been sentenced to 46 years in prison for over 90 child sexual assault offenses. Burrows was convicted of abusing 24 boys as young as nine while working at a boarding school and as a scout master. The judge described Burrows as a 'despicable man' and highlighted the extensive delay in justice for the victims due to his fleeing the country. Burrows only returned to the UK in 2024 when he ran out of money.</p>

          <p>A planned peace agreement between the DRC and Rwanda, brokered by the US, faces caution and skepticism due to past ceasefires being broken and concerns about the motivations behind the agreement. While both countries aim to present a plan to end the ongoing crisis, analysts suggest the US-brokered MoU is driven by Washington's self-interest, particularly in accessing raw materials. The agreement's specific terms regarding mineral processing and the withdrawal of M23 rebels from occupied territories remain unclear, raising questions about its effectiveness and potential benefits for the Congolese people.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, experts are advising consumers on how to sell gold jewelry for cash effectively. It is important to check the spot price of gold before selling, as well as understanding the karat of the gold being sold. Consumers should be aware of the potential for higher tax rates on gold profits, as the IRS may classify physical gold as a 'collectible,' leading to a maximum federal long-term capital gains tax of 28%. Some experts believe gold prices may have peaked, while others suggest there is still room for growth.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's efforts to weaken democratic institutions, a report suggests that these attempts are largely failing due to mounting pushback. While the administration has succeeded in dismantling some programs, it is facing resistance from the courts, the media, and civil society. The report highlights the administration's poor execution of authoritarian tactics, strategic errors, and increasing public disapproval. However, it cautions that American democracy is not entirely safe and depends on society's commitment to resisting authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are experiencing a sharp decline due to the Trump administration's steep tariffs, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%, while China has retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. products. This has resulted in a widespread booking freeze as shippers pause to reassess costs and trade strategies. Retailers are concerned about potential price hikes and empty shelves as inventory dwindles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown at the beginning of President Trump's second term, influenced by a surge in imports and uncertainty surrounding his trade policies. Gross domestic product declined at a 0.3% annualized rate, marking a significant decrease from the previous quarter. Analysts attribute this to companies frontloading imports to avoid tariffs, leading to a skewed GDP reading. Despite the slowdown, key economic indicators like the unemployment rate remain relatively strong, though some economists caution that these measures may not fully reflect the current economic conditions.</p>

          <p>Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have decreased to some of the lowest rates in years, according to preliminary CDC figures, reversing a surge in mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. While death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, they have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Experts caution that analyzing long-term trends in diabetes deaths is complex due to changes in the definition of the disease and variations in how death certificates record diabetes deaths. Recent trends were also before the introduction of new diabetes treatments that have seen high demand.</p>

The agreement involved El Salvador housing only 'convicted criminals,' prompting concerns about the assessment process and the use of a wartime law to expedite deportations. In exchange for opening his prison, Bukele sought a list of MS-13 leaders in U.S. custody to be sent back to El Salvador. The U.S. has paid El Salvador millions to imprison the deportees.</p>

The goal of the hacking was to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate change litigation. Victims say the hacking was aimed at silencing fossil-fuel critics, and the case highlights a broad assault on American civil society.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Southern California Edison's parent company has indicated that the company is likely to incur 'material losses' related to the Eaton fire, which caused significant damage and fatalities. While investigations are ongoing, Edison's internal probe has not identified any other potential sources of ignition. The company is partially protected by an emergency fund created by state lawmakers, but may have to reimburse a portion of the fund if found to have acted imprudently. The company reported first-quarter net income, but its valuation has decreased since the wildfires.</p>
