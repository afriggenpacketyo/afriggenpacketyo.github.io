          <p>Nottingham Forest is expected to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham despite leading them to a Europa League victory, is reportedly in advanced discussions with the club. Nuno's tenure ended after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite having guided Forest to their highest league finish in decades last season. If appointed, Postecoglou would be the eighth permanent manager under owner Evangelos Marinakis, tasked with building on the team's current 10th-place standing in the Premier League.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, the UK government has published league tables ranking the performance of NHS trusts across England, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven criteria, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial health, sorting them into four performance segments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables would enhance public transparency and accountability, but organizations representing the trusts have raised concerns about the metrics used. They worry that the significant weight given to financial status could misrepresent the quality of patient care and lead trusts to prioritize metrics over patient needs.</p>

It clarifies that while drivers like McLaren's Norris and Piastri have their own engineering teams for car set-up, they operate under a collective team strategy until the race begins. The analysis also highlights Max Verstappen's exceptional mental capacity, which allows him to process external information like pit stop times during a race. Other topics include Yuki Tsunoda's uncertain future at Racing Bulls and the positive impact new Red Bull team principal Laurent Mekies is having on the team's performance.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has issued a complete evacuation order for all residents of Gaza City, warning that it will operate with "great force" as it prepares to seize the enclave's largest urban area. The directive instructs civilians to move south towards Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone, as part of Israel's stated objective to eliminate Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has approved the plan, which follows a week of ground operations within the city.

          <p>This short article from The Economist uses a metaphorical comparison between a Donald Trump social media post and the annual Mexican Independence Day parade in Chicago. The piece juxtaposes Trump's post, which featured his image on an "Apocalypse Now" poster with a threatening caption aimed at Chicago, with the traditional start of the parade. The author uses this imagery to subtly comment on the disruptive and chaotic nature of Trump's political style. The article suggests that while the literal "invasion" of Chicago was postponed, the rhetoric foreshadows a potentially tumultuous political climate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a reform that makes most Americans eligible to purchase affordable "copper plans" on the Obamacare exchanges. Previously, these plans, which feature lower premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs, were restricted to individuals under 30 or those granted a rare hardship exemption. The new rule effectively expands this exemption to a much wider population, a move the administration claims will save families thousands annually and encourage uninsured individuals to get coverage. Proponents argue this will help stabilize the Obamacare markets by attracting younger, healthier enrollees and reduce uncompensated care costs for hospitals.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister, Khadga Prasad Oli, has resigned following escalating anti-government protests that have turned deadly, with at least 19 people killed by security forces. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on several social media platforms but has since grown into a broader movement against widespread corruption and nepotism. Despite the government lifting the social media ban, protests have continued, with demonstrators setting fire to the residences of several senior politicians. The ongoing turmoil reflects deep-seated frustration among Nepal's youth, who are demanding systemic change and an end to the corruption they believe is stifling their country's future.</p>

          <p>The latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as the Nation's Report Card, show a continued decline in student achievement across the United States. Eighth-graders' science scores and twelfth-graders' math and reading scores have all fallen since 2019, with the lowest-performing students reaching historic lows. These scores are the first to be released since the Trump administration implemented significant cuts at the U.S. Education Department, which oversees the testing. The data also revealed an increase in student absenteeism, with nearly one-third of 12th-graders reporting they missed three or more days of school in the month before the test.</p>

          <p>A new law enacted by President Trump is set to cut federal Medicaid spending by approximately $900 billion over the next decade, a move that could severely impact children's hospitals. These hospitals rely on Medicaid for about half their revenue and stand to lose significant supplemental payments used to fund specialized pediatric care, mental health services, and abuse screenings. While Republicans claim the cuts target fraud and non-working adults, hospital administrators warn the reductions will inevitably affect care for vulnerable children. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 7.5 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 as a result of the legislation.</p>

China's trade surplus with India reached a record $99.21 billion in the last fiscal year, while increased Russian oil imports have also widened India's deficit with Moscow.

          <p>A U.S. court has ruled against breaking up Google, in part because the recent explosion of generative AI has fundamentally altered the search market landscape. Judge Amit Mehta, who previously found Google had illegally monopolized search, decided against forcing the sale of its Chrome browser, citing AI as a potential "game changer." The judge's opinion noted that the rapid emergence of AI chatbots from competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft presents a significant new competitive threat to Google's dominance. This shift in the tech landscape, which occurred during the trial, was deemed a profound factor in shaping the final, less severe penalty.</p>

          <p>North Korean state media announced that leader Kim Jong Un personally supervised the final ground test of a new high-thrust, solid-fuel engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Solid-fuel missiles are considered a greater threat because they can be launched more quickly and are harder to detect than liquid-fuel variants. Analysts believe this successful test signals that Pyongyang is preparing for a full test launch of a new ICBM, possibly before the end of the year. The development comes amid deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia, which may be providing technical expertise to accelerate Pyongyang's weapons programs.</p>

          <p>China is pushing to finalize and sign an upgraded free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) by the end of the year. The new "Cafta 3.0" protocol aims to broaden market access in key sectors like agriculture, digital trade, and pharmaceuticals, and deepen cooperation in the green and digital economies. This initiative is part of Beijing's strategy to strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner and diversify its exports. The move is seen as an effort to bolster regional trade networks in response to increasing global competition and protectionist policies, particularly from the United States.</p>

          <p>Norway's Labour party, led by Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, has secured a second term in office following a general election with high voter turnout. While Labour emerged as the winner, the anti-immigration Progress Party made significant gains, doubling its support to become the second-largest party in parliament. Labour now has the opportunity to form a narrow majority coalition with four smaller centre-left parties, a process expected to take several weeks. The election campaign focused on the rising cost of living, the future of the oil industry, and foreign policy issues like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year jail sentence, overturning a controversial hospital stay that followed his return from exile. Last year, Thaksin was transferred from prison to a luxury hospital wing just hours into an eight-year sentence for corruption, which was later commuted to one year by the king. The court found this transfer to be unlawful, stating his medical condition was not critical enough to warrant it. The ruling is a significant development for the influential Shinawatra political dynasty and addresses public criticism over perceived preferential treatment for the powerful.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that populist right-wing movements in both the US and UK are actively attempting to rewrite national histories to advance their political agendas. It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from Smithsonian museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" history curriculum as examples of attempts to erase narratives of imperial history and racial injustice. The author contends that this historical revisionism is a deliberate strategy to dismantle the democratic and civil rights achievements of the 20th century. By reframing national stories, these movements provide ideological justification for policies that erode rights for vulnerable communities.</p>
