          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $77,000, as it joined a broader global market downturn triggered by President Trump's restrictive global tariffs. The cryptocurrency market mirrored the anxiety felt in traditional financial markets, with Ether and Solana also suffering substantial losses. Investors, anticipating further market declines, offloaded their crypto holdings over the weekend, exacerbating the price drop. Experts suggest Bitcoin's movements will likely remain tied to equities amid recession fears, though some believe it could benefit long-term from deglobalization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of CEO Council members reveals widespread concern among business leaders regarding President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with many predicting a recession, increased prices, and job losses.

Concerns range from sector-specific issues driving up costs to fears of boycotts against American brands overseas. The uncertainty surrounding the trade policy is causing companies to prepare for various scenarios, including price hikes and adjustments to sourcing and pricing decisions.</p>

          <p>Amid President Trump's tariff announcements, economists are debating whether the world is heading toward a recession. While stock market performance doesn't always mirror the overall economy, significant market declines can signal a fundamental reappraisal of future profits. Increased tariffs are expected to raise costs and lower profits for companies, increasing the likelihood of a recession. The UK economy, for example, experienced minimal growth recently, leaving it vulnerable to potential recessionary pressures.</p>
