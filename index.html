          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. This fund is part of President Trump's major legislative package, intended to offset significant Medicaid cuts that raised concerns about the viability of rural healthcare facilities. Oz stated the funding aims to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and telehealth expansion to improve healthcare delivery. The broader legislation also introduces stricter Medicaid work requirements, which the CBO estimates could lead to nearly 12 million people losing coverage over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of wildfires across Canada is causing hazy skies and poor air quality in several U.S. states, including those in the Midwest and Northeast. With Canada experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota have issued extended air quality alerts. Health officials are advising residents, especially vulnerable individuals, to limit outdoor activities due to health risks such as respiratory irritation and more severe cardiovascular issues. Meteorologists predict that current wind patterns will likely continue transporting smoke into the U.S. for the foreseeable future, prolonging the environmental and health concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts likely to be under £950 per person. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively large commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA plans to launch a consultation in October to define eligibility for the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The regulator is advising affected consumers to contact their loan providers directly to avoid fees from claims management companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former prosecutor and prominent Fox News host, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation passed with a 50-45 vote, solidifying the appointment of a staunch supporter of President Trump to one of the country's most powerful prosecutor roles. Pirro had been serving in an acting capacity since May, following the collapse of a previous nomination. Her confirmation was part of a series of votes on Trump's appointees that Republicans pushed through before the Senate adjourned for its September recess.</p>

          <p>The search continues for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider Brown armed and dangerous and have offered a $7,500 reward for information leading to his arrest. The victims, all local residents, were known to the suspect, who was a regular at the bar. Family members of Brown have stated that he has struggled with mental illness for years, suggesting his actions may have been the result of a mental health crisis rather than a specific dispute with the victims.</p>

The 24-year-old finished two strokes ahead of England's Charley Hull, who recorded her fourth runner-up finish in a major. Yamashita maintained her composure throughout the final day, holding the lead she established with a remarkable round of 65 on Friday. Despite a persistent challenge from Hull, late bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes ended the Englishwoman's hopes, allowing Yamashita to secure the historic victory and a $1.462 million prize.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption occurred shortly after a major earthquake in the region, though there is no confirmed link. Russian authorities issued and then lifted a tsunami warning for parts of the peninsula, stating that the ash cloud was moving over the Pacific Ocean and did not pose a threat to populated areas. Volcanologists confirmed this was the first historically documented eruption of Krasheninnikov, with its last known activity occurring around the 16th century.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Murder in the Dollhouse," examines the 2020 disappearance and murder of Jennifer Dulos, a Connecticut mother of five who vanished amid a contentious divorce. Her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, was charged with her murder but died by suicide before his trial, maintaining his innocence. Jennifer's body was never found, but she was declared legally dead in 2023. The case, which captivated the nation, also led to the conviction of Fotis's girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, for conspiracy to commit murder. The author, Richard Cohen, aims to explore the darker side of a seemingly perfect suburban life and restore focus on Jennifer as a person, not just a victim.</p>

Despite recent negotiations, President Trump's criticism of Canada's foreign policy and the imposition of a 35% tariff rate on some goods have cooled expectations for a quick resolution. However, nearly 90% of Canadian exports to the U.S. can still cross duty-free under the existing USMCA agreement, providing a buffer against the full impact. Analysts suggest Canada is playing a longer game, hoping that pressure from U.S. businesses affected by retaliatory tariffs will eventually strengthen its negotiating position.</p>

          <p>A memorial service was held in Wembley, London, to remember the victims of the June Air India crash in Ahmedabad, India, which killed all but one person on board. The service was organized by Miten Patel, whose parents, Ashok and Shobhana Patel, were among the victims. Mr. Patel spoke of the long process of repatriating and identifying his parents' remains, a painful ordeal that was complicated by errors from Indian authorities. He described his parents as loving and respected members of the community, and expressed gratitude for the support his family has received during the tragic time.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a hard-fought victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix after a masterful defensive drive against his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy after falling to fifth on the opening lap, which put him in the lead but required him to manage his tires carefully. In the closing laps, Piastri, on fresher tires, launched a series of attacks but was unable to pass on the notoriously difficult-to-overtake track. The win reduces Norris's championship deficit to Piastri to just nine points, while Mercedes' George Russell finished third.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has departed for its August recess without an agreement to advance dozens of President Trump's nominees, following a contentious standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Negotiations broke down after days of talks, culminating in the president telling Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" on social media. Democrats have been blocking fast-track confirmations, forcing lengthy roll-call votes on each nominee. In response, Republicans are now considering changing Senate rules in September to expedite the confirmation process, a move Democrats warn would be a "huge mistake."</p>

The project is part of a wider $19 billion overhaul of JFK aimed at modernizing the aging infrastructure of the major U.S. travel hub. The new terminal will feature light-filled spaces, 23 gates, extensive retail and dining, and its own resilient microgrid for power.</p>

          <p>Germany is grappling with a continued decline in its birth rate, which fell to an average of 1.35 children per woman in 2024, fueling concerns about the country's long-term prosperity and demographic stability. The trend is part of a global phenomenon, but in Germany it has ignited a debate over its causes, from women choosing to be child-free to economic anxieties and a lack of state support. Experts point to a "fertility gap," where people desire more children than they have, suggesting that improved work-life balance and more reliable childcare could help reverse the trend and prevent future strain on social insurance systems.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic imagines how tours at U.S. national parks and historic sites might sound under new guidelines aimed at removing content that "inappropriately disparages" American history. The piece humorously rewrites tour guide scripts for sites like Stonewall, Manzanar, and the Trail of Tears, focusing on superficial details like "natural beauty" while comically avoiding the actual historical context of civil rights struggles, internment, or forced removal. The satire critiques the potential for historical revisionism by presenting absurdly sanitized versions of pivotal and often painful moments in the nation's past, such as describing the Civil War as being "fought over nothing."</p>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 new Brazilian coffee companies, a significant move that provides an alternative market for Brazilian exporters facing new U.S. tariffs. The approval comes as the United States prepares to implement a 50% tariff on some Brazilian products, including coffee, creating a major challenge for a trade relationship valued at over $4 billion annually. This development highlights the shifting global trade dynamics, as Brazil, a major U.S. supplier, strengthens its ties with China, its top overall trade partner. The new permits allow Brazilian coffee companies to export to the growing Chinese market for the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident raises further concerns about managing Messi's workload, as the superstar has dealt with various leg injuries over the past few seasons and recently skipped the MLS All-Star game due to fatigue.</p>

Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," and Palestinian leaders condemned it as crossing "all red lines."
