          <p>Morgan Stanley reports a surge in US investor interest in Chinese stocks, reaching a five-year high, with over 90% expressing a willingness to increase their exposure to China's market. The interest spans various sectors, including humanoid robotics, biotech, and new consumer companies, extending beyond US-listed Chinese equities to include the onshore market. This reversal of a multi-year trend is attributed to China's leadership in specific sectors, efforts to stabilize its economy and equity market, improved liquidity, and demand for diversification from US assets. While many investors paused investing in China, they are now reassessing individual stocks, suggesting a gradual but meaningful increase in capital inflows over time. Optimism score is not directly reflected in this summary.</p>

          <p>American pharmaceutical company MSD, known as Merck in the US, is abandoning its planned £1bn expansion in the UK, citing insufficient government investment in the life sciences sector. The company will relocate its research to the US and eliminate over 100 UK jobs, criticizing successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines and vaccines. This decision includes vacating facilities in London, resulting in 125 job losses, and follows AstraZeneca's earlier reduction of investment in a vaccine plant due to decreased government support. Despite industry sources highlighting ongoing funding in the AI and life sciences intersection around Kings Cross, the company emphasizes challenges related to UK investment and drug pricing pressures. The shift is also influenced by pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for US customers and increase domestic investment.

          <p>Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk died after being shot at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University, sparking widespread condemnation from politicians across the political spectrum. President Trump mourned Kirk's death, blaming the "radical left" for the violence, and ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff. Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned the murder, and former Presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton all issued statements. The article details various reactions, including Speaker Mike Johnson's call for civil discourse, Vice President JD Vance's tribute to Kirk's influence, and statements from other political figures expressing grief and concern over political violence.

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah college campus underscores the escalating political tensions and violence in America. The article recounts the events leading up to the shooting and notes that Kirk's death is the latest in a series of politically motivated attacks. Politicians from both parties have condemned the violence, but the article suggests that the divisive rhetoric and easy access to firearms contribute to a climate of fear and potential for bloodshed. The article also highlights President Trump's response, blaming the "radical left" for Kirk's murder, and the subsequent calls for a crackdown on left-wing groups.

          <p>Everton has undergone a significant transformation, avoiding relegation and investing heavily in new players after David Moyes' appointment as manager. The club's net spend of £97m on nine players is their highest ever, a turnaround from previous seasons marked by financial constraints and points deductions. This is attributed to improved financial management, the Friedkin Group's takeover, and strategic timing of signings after the Premier League's financial year end.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis suggests that housing costs in San Francisco have returned to "normal" levels, meaning that the share of income spent on mortgage payments is similar to what it was in 2018. This is due to a combination of slowing home-price growth and strong wage growth, particularly in tech-driven sectors. However, this does not mean that San Francisco is becoming affordable, and renters may not experience the same relief. The AI boom is reportedly spiking rents and crowding out lower-wage tenants.
