          <p>The Senate confirmed Charles Kushner to serve as the ambassador to France and Monaco by a vote of 51-45. Kushner was pardoned by Trump during the president's first term for crimes including federal tax evasion and FEC violations. During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Kushner stated that he had made "very, very, very serious mistakes" but believed his mistakes made him "better with my judgment, better in my view of life, better in my values to really make me more qualified to do this job." Kushner is the father of Trump's son-in-law and former advisor, Jared Kushner. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with both the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, the deals involved politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's position as a midsize economy. The agreement with the EU will generate benefits by 2040, while the deal with the US lowers tariffs on British luxury cars.

          <p>The Trump administration will pay nearly $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, the Trump supporter who was shot and killed while in the mob breaching the House Speaker's Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021. Outgoing U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed his disagreement with the Justice Department's decision to settle the lawsuit. The parties had reached a settlement in principle in early May in the $30 million civil suit filed by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch on behalf of Babbitt's estate, including her late husband. Babbitt's death was a rallying point for Trump loyalists and Capitol rioters who alleged police used unnecessary force in stopping the mob on Jan. 6. </p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery manufacturer, experienced a surge in its Hong Kong trading debut, however, U.S. onshore investors were notably excluded from participating in the IPO. This exclusion highlights the increasing financial decoupling between the U.S. and China, driven by ongoing trade tensions and national security concerns. CATL, which has been labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, restricted U.S. investors from the share sale to avoid regulatory hurdles. This event underscores the growing trend of financial separation impacting investment opportunities and market access for both countries.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, aiming to stimulate economic growth amid a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This decision follows a series of measures, including deposit rate reductions by state-backed lenders, to protect their net interest margin. The move is part of a broader stimulus package to support the economy, with further easing expected by the end of the year.  (not investment advice)</p>
