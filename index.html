          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded to state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant upset. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, was attempting a political comeback. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, would be the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of New York City if elected in the general election. In his concession speech, Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's victory and indicated he would consider his next steps.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies reveals significant damage to key Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, following U.S. airstrikes. The images show craters on access roads and at tunnel entrances at Fordow, while the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center exhibits destruction on the surface and at tunnel entrances. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by U.S. ordnance appear to be filled and covered. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, and American officials claim the strikes have severely set back Iran‚Äôs nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race pits left-wing outsider Zohran Mamdani against former Governor Andrew Cuomo in a contest reflecting the Democratic Party's internal struggles. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, gained traction by focusing on affordability issues like free public buses and universal childcare. Cuomo, seeking a comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, is viewed as the moderate establishment candidate, supported by older and Black voters. The race is seen as a proxy war between the party's left-wing and moderate factions, with implications for the party's future direction nationally.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by months. The assessment indicates that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, were sealed off, but the underground enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact. The DIA assessment also suggests some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the findings, while others stand by claims that the strikes have obliterated Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have linked the spin of dying stars to the birth of new stars, revealing insights into the Milky Way's past. The study found that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The research presents direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time.</p>
