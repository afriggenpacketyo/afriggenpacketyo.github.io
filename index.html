            <p>Saturday's newspapers cover a range of topics, including a surge in misogyny and racism in UK schools attributed to social media influencers like Andrew Tate, according to a NASUWT union survey. Government plans to send rejected asylum seekers to "return hubs" in the Balkans have received the UN's refugee agency endorsement. A royal author is promising "sensational revelations" in a new book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, claiming their relationship is at a "crisis point." Finally, the i-paper predicts a potential mortgage price war due to Trump's tariff plans and lower inflation, raising the prospect of base-rate cuts by the Bank of England.</p>

            <p>China's museums are being tasked with promoting ethnic unity and dispelling 'wrong historical views,' according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums should avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities and should instead focus on telling the 'China story' through archaeological findings. This initiative aims to cultivate a sense of community within the country, representing China as 'diverse but unified' while emphasizing respect and accommodation of differences. Museums are expected to place cultural relics and historical narratives within a system of overall development of the Chinese nation.</p>

            <p>US air strikes on a key oil terminal on Yemen's Red Sea coast, controlled by the Houthi movement, have reportedly killed at least 74 people and wounded 171, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military stated that the attack on Ras Isa aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Iran-backed Houthis, while the Houthi-led government claimed it was a civilian facility and a 'war crime'. Thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to condemn the strikes, and Iran's foreign ministry strongly condemned the attacks as 'barbaric'. The US military maintains the strikes targeted the economic source of power for the Houthis.</p>

            <p>Following Harvard University's public rejection of a series of authoritarian demands from Trump administration officials, one official reportedly attempted to claim the letter was sent by mistake. The original letter ordered Harvard to discontinue diversity efforts, limit student protests, install right-wing faculty, and spy on international students. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned these demands, asserting the university's independence and constitutional rights. Despite the alleged attempt to retract the letter, the Trump administration has since frozen Harvard's public funding and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.</p>

            <p>A recent poll by the NASUWT teaching union indicates that social media influencers are contributing to an increase in misogyny and sexism in schools. Nearly three in five teachers believe social media use has negatively impacted behavior, with influencer Andrew Tate specifically named by several teachers. Teachers reported instances of students adopting Tate's views on women, leading to concerns among parents and educators. The Department for Education (DfE) stated it is supporting teachers in addressing the 'damaging impact' of 'dangerous influencers'.</p>

Yamamoto pitched seven scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, showcasing his diverse repertoire and solidifying his position as a top-tier talent. Manager Dave Roberts praised Yamamoto's ability to elevate his game against one of baseball's best pitchers. Yamamoto's ERA is currently the best in the National League. This victory further cements one of the most promising early storylines for this year’s team — affirming Yamamoto, in just his second MLB season, as a legitimate frontline talent seemingly poised for a Cy Young chase.</p>

The Trump administration has flown hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants deemed members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, where they are being held in a mega-prison.

Police reports from a 2019 detention cite his clothing and a 'reliable source' as evidence of gang affiliation, though his lawyers argue the cited gang clique is based in New York, where he has never lived. He has never been convicted of any crime and was granted a 'withholding of removal' order in 2019 due to fear of persecution by a rival gang.</p>

Despite initial confidence, attempts to secure a ceasefire have faltered, with Washington blaming both sides. Simultaneously, the US and Ukraine have taken steps toward a minerals deal, aiming to establish an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

            <p>Lilly Sabri, a fitness influencer with a large YouTube following, plans to return to Instagram after a long absence, vowing to keep her relationships private following a public scandal. Two years ago, a gossip podcast shared a story about a man allegedly cheating on his fiancée, with clues pointing to Sabri's then-partner, leading to online harassment and the end of her relationship. She has since moved back to the UK, laid off staff, and is rebuilding her businesses while managing the heartbreak and shock. Sabri urges her fans to be mindful of what they share online.</p>

            <p>The Somali film Aano Qabiil, which warns against clan revenge killings, has gained attention after one of its actors, Guudey Mohamed Geedi, was shot dead in a clan feud. The film aimed to highlight the futility of vendettas between rival clans. Geedi played a character who tried to prevent a tea shop owner from being killed. His murder highlights the ongoing issue of clan-related violence in Somalia, where disputes often go uninvestigated, perpetuating a cycle of violence.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home, became a minister in prison and had his sentence reduced. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation to Cambodia, a country he left as a toddler. Newsom also offered a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a U.S. Army veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, who was convicted of drug charges after suffering from PTSD.</p>

Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market following volatility sparked by US trade tariffs. The rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell, indicating investors were losing confidence in the economy. Uncertainty over the impact of tariffs led investors to demand higher returns for buying government bonds. This can affect budgets, public spending, and interest rates for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has begun releasing approximately 10,000 pages of previously classified records related to the 1968 assassination of Democratic Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The documents include handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene photos, and FBI memos. The release, ordered by President Trump and supported by RFK's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., could reignite speculation about the assassination, as Kennedy Jr. doubts Sirhan's sole responsibility. An additional 50,000 pages of related files have been discovered and are being prepared for release.</p>

            <p>A new study by Chinese scientists warns that some of the world's leading rice-producing countries are facing severe heavy metal pollution, particularly cadmium contamination. The research, which analyzed soil samples from around the world, indicates that South and Southeast Asia's most fertile rice regions are particularly affected. The findings raise concerns about global food safety, as up to 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by toxic heavy metal pollution, and 17% of arable land is contaminated. Cadmium, a carcinogen, is most prevalent in major rice-producing regions, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Thailand.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that legally, the term 'woman' refers to a biological woman, providing clarity that had been missing from equality law conversations. The judgement argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term 'woman' must exclude biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender. This means that women-only spaces, such as changing rooms and women's refuges, are intended for biological women. The ruling has drawn contrasting reactions, with some celebrating it as a victory for common sense and others viewing it as devastating for trans rights.</p>
