        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, condemned the American strikes in Iran as "outrageous," asserting that Washington bears full responsibility for the repercussions. He stated that the door to diplomacy, which should always remain open, is currently closed, accusing the U.S. of betraying negotiations. Araghchi also criticized both Israel and the U.S. for attacking Iran amidst diplomatic talks, further alleging that Trump deceived his voters by engaging in "forever wars" alongside Israel. The Iranian official claimed that Trump had betrayed his promise not to involve the U.S. in such conflicts. Optimism is low given the apparent breakdown of diplomacy and the heightened tensions.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials provided details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer." Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine described it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history," causing "extremely severe damage and destruction." The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri, requiring multiple refuelings and fighter jet escorts. The U.S. also launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine against the Isfahan site, and employed deception tactics to ensure the safety of the aircraft, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack an "incredible and overwhelming success."</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend itself following U.S. attacks on its nuclear facilities, adding that the attacks would have "everlasting consequences."

Araghchi accused the U.S. and Israel of sabotaging recent diplomatic efforts, noting that negotiations were underway when the attacks occurred. President Trump described the strikes as a "spectacular military success" that "completely obliterated" Iran's enrichment facilities, though this claim has not been independently verified.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that "Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" following U.S. attacks on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. He emphasized that the mission was not aimed at regime change but rather at neutralizing threats to U.S. national interests and the self-defense of troops and ally Israel. Hegseth echoed President Trump's remarks about the "destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity," although the full extent of the damage remained unclear. The secretary's remarks came after Trump hailed the strikes as a success. The tone suggests a decisive blow against Iran's nuclear capabilities, but the long-term impact remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the landmark Dobbs decision, the pro-life movement finds itself at a critical juncture, grappling with the persistent reality of abortion access. While celebrating the victory of overturning Roe v. Wade, leaders acknowledge the ongoing challenges of reducing abortion rates and navigating the evolving legal and political landscape. Key strategies include efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, restrict access to abortion pills, and advocate for policies that promote alternatives to abortion. The movement faces the complex task of shaping public opinion and advancing its goals in a diverse and often polarized society.</p>

          <p>Three years after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, the pro-life movement is confronting the reality that abortion remains prevalent. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, acknowledged that abortions have not decreased and may even be rising, with at least 1.1 million occurring in the year after Dobbs. Key challenges include defunding Planned Parenthood, restricting access to abortion pills, and investing in preferred political candidates. Katie Xavios, national director of the American Life League, expressed concerns about the lack of restrictions on mifepristone distribution, emphasizing the need for a truly pro-life person in office.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. conducted a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they have been "obliterated." The strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel. The U.S. used B-2 stealth bombers and GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) to target Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Initial assessments indicate extreme damage and destruction, but Iran has denied suffering a major blow. The article also explores potential Iranian retaliation strategies and reactions from world leaders.</p>

Experts warn that more such deaths are likely amid the current administration's "mass deportation" push.

The detainee's family alleges that he was mistreated while in jail, including being given medications without explanation.
