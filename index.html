          <p>The number of students from Asia arriving in the United States this August has dropped by nearly 24% compared to the previous year, marking the lowest figure for that month on record, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period. Data from the International Trade Administration shows significant declines from major source countries, with arrivals from mainland China down 12.4% and India down a steep 44.5%. This trend, observed during a key month for student arrivals ahead of the fall semester, suggests a notable downturn in international enrollment. Many existing students are also choosing to remain in the U.S. during breaks, fearing reentry issues.</p>

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital has commented on OpenAI's recent partnership announcements with chipmakers AMD and Nvidia, emphasizing that these are currently just deals, not full-scale deployments. He stated that performance will be the ultimate determinant, noting that "the best chips will win." The move is seen as evidence of an intensifying AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and Chinese firms like DeepSeek, and highlights a global scarcity of computing power. OpenAI's partnerships are aimed at increasing production to build more complex AI models and meet the surging demand for AI services across the entire ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its second week, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has instructed its members to continue working. The union, which represents over 20,000 aviation safety professionals, warned that any job action is illegal and could result in termination. Air traffic controllers are deemed essential federal workers and are required to work without pay during shutdowns, with a guarantee of back pay once funding is restored. This situation arises amid a pre-existing nationwide shortage of controllers, which has already contributed to airport delays across the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article frames the ongoing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Portland, Oregon, as a modern form of nullification, comparing the actions of activists and local officials to those of Confederates in the 1860s. The author argues that by obstructing federal immigration law enforcement, the city of Portland and the state of Oregon are attempting to supersede federal authority, creating a de facto proxy conflict between local and federal officers. The piece contends that such actions, supported by groups like Antifa and tacitly by Democratic officials, undermine national law and order for political gain, setting a dangerous historical precedent.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international criminal network suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China in the past year. The year-long investigation, dubbed Operation Echosteep, was triggered after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. This led to the discovery of a shipment of nearly 900 phones and the eventual arrest of 18 suspects, including two alleged ringleaders. Police believe the gang was responsible for exporting nearly 40% of all phones stolen in London, where thieves were paid up to £300 per device.</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo beer, reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations but reiterated its previously lowered guidance for the full year, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company's net sales saw a 15% drop from the same period last year, and its operating margin also declined. In September, the beverage giant had already slashed its full-year earnings outlook due to dampened consumer demand, including a noted trend of lower demand from Hispanic consumers. The company's stock saw a modest increase in extended trading following the earnings announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is becoming a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $150,000 HELOC, current monthly payments would be approximately $1,811 for a 10-year repayment period and $1,424 for a 15-year period, which is notably cheaper than a year ago. Because HELOCs have variable rates, future rate cuts are expected to lower these costs further, making them an attractive tool for tapping into home equity. The article advises that the risk depends on the borrower's financial stability and equity levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon. The ruling came after the president mobilized troops from California and Texas to Portland, a day after the same judge had blocked the use of Oregon's own National Guard. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut questioned whether the move was a direct contravention of her previous order, stating the protests did not justify a military presence. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and California Governor Gavin Newsom both condemned the deployment as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of waging a "hybrid war" against Germany, stating that Moscow's aggression extends beyond Ukraine to target all of Europe. Merz told a broadcaster that Putin is conducting an information war aimed at undermining Europe's political order and instilling fear. He linked recent drone incidents over European airports to Russian intimidation efforts and asserted that Germany would not be intimidated. The Chancellor's comments highlight escalating tensions and the belief that Russia is engaged in covert and overt actions to destabilize the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues without a clear resolution, analysts suggest that an upcoming military pay date could force a compromise between the White House and Congress. Approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members are scheduled to be paid on October 15, and the political cost of missing this deadline may be too high for either party to bear. Goldman Sachs economists noted this could be a crucial "forcing event" that leads to at least a temporary funding agreement. However, if this pressure point fails to produce a deal, the shutdown could become even more prolonged.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has upgraded a tornado that struck Enderlin, North Dakota, in June to an EF-5, the highest possible rating. This marks the first EF-5 tornado to hit the United States in 12 years, with estimated maximum wind speeds exceeding 210 mph. The tornado, which was initially rated as an EF-3, resulted in the deaths of three people. It carved a 12-mile path of destruction, destroying a farm, tipping over train cars, and throwing a tanker car over 475 feet. The last confirmed EF-5 tornado in the U.S. occurred in Moore, Oklahoma, in 2013.</p>

Legal experts suggest this move violates impartiality regulations and ethics norms, raising concerns about political motivations behind the investigations as the administration seeks to prosecute its critics.</p>
