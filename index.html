            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on imposing new tariffs on most countries, reducing them to a baseline of 10%, while escalating tariffs on China to 125%. This decision follows significant market volatility and criticism of his initial sweeping tariff plans. Trump stated the pause was influenced by other countries expressing willingness to negotiate trade deals, and concerns about market stability.  The move led to a substantial stock market rally, reflecting investor relief. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, launched nearly three years ago, has become a crucial resource for individuals experiencing mental health emergencies.  However, the lifeline is facing significant challenges due to understaffing and underfunding, which threaten its ability to provide adequate support. A recent study highlights that while call volume has increased, access to care following initial calls has not improved.  The potential for further federal cuts could exacerbate the situation, leading to increased hospitalizations and deaths.

            <p>President Trump's latest tariffs are expected to significantly impact consumer spending, potentially increasing prices for everyday goods. These tariffs, in addition to previous global taxes and retaliatory measures, will likely affect a wide range of consumer products, from groceries to electronics. Experts warn that these tariffs could exacerbate existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting low-income families who spend a larger portion of their income on essential goods.

            <p>President Trump signed an executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation suit against Fox News. The order aims to restrict the firm's access to government buildings and limit its ability to represent clients with federal business. This action is part of a broader effort by Trump to punish legal entities that have opposed his interests. Experts argue the orders are unconstitutional and an attempt to intimidate lawyers challenging his administration.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally remove alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act without due process. The court held that detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal, but narrowed the legal mechanism for doing so. The ruling raises concerns about the fate of those already deported to El Salvador and the extent of the opportunity they will have to challenge their removal. The decision has been compared to the Korematsu case, with dissenters accusing the majority of ignoring the consequences of their ruling.</p>
