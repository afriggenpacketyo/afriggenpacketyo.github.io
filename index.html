          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant service outage on Saturday, with many phones being relegated to "SOS mode," which only allows for emergency calls. The company acknowledged a software issue was the cause and stated their engineers were actively working on a resolution. According to the service tracking website DownDetector, outage reports peaked in the afternoon with nearly 23,000 complaints from coast to coast, marking another major service disruption for the carrier following a similar event in October 2024.</p>

          <p>The White House is moving forward with a plan to rebrand the Department of Defense back to its historical name, the Department of War. President Trump has publicly supported the change, arguing the name better reflects the military's purpose and aligns with a history of victory under the former title. A White House spokesperson connected the move to a restoration of military values focused on "offense — not just defense." The change would legally require an act of Congress, though the President has suggested he may not need legislative approval.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals the largely unregulated and for-profit industry of "body brokers" in the United States, where companies acquire donated human corpses, dismember them, and sell the parts for medical research. Unlike in Europe, loose U.S. laws allow companies to charge significant "processing" fees, effectively creating a profitable market that has led to horrific stories of exploitation and disrespect for the deceased. While proponents argue these brokers fill a critical need for medical and scientific advancement, critics and affected families call for stricter regulations to prevent the mistreatment of vulnerable individuals and their loved ones during times of grief.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England suggests that student attendance during the first week of the school year is a strong predictor of chronic absenteeism later on. The figures revealed that 57% of pupils who missed any school in the first week of September 2024 went on to be "persistently absent," compared to just 14% of those with perfect first-week attendance. In response, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to intensify efforts to ensure children are present from day one, as attendance rates, while improving, have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not be running for reelection in 2026, according to a senior GOP official. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Her decision to step down after two terms is expected to set off a competitive race for the open seat. Representative Ashley Hinson, also a Republican, is reportedly planning to announce her candidacy for the position, while several Democrats have already declared their intent to run for the Senate seat.</p>

          <h2>Illinois Governor Calls Potential Federal Troop Deployment in Chicago an 'Invasion'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated there has been no communication from the White House and suggested the move is politically motivated rather than a genuine effort to fight crime, possibly to influence future elections. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of the city's crime rate, escalating the political conflict between the state and federal governments over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto is uniquely positioned to offer the world a new diplomatic framework based on "constructive pragmatism." As a major economic power with ties to competing global ideologies, Indonesia is not confined to a single political camp. This allows it to act as a bridge and model a cooperative approach in an international system often paralyzed by confrontation and competing national interests. The article argues that Prabowo's leadership could provide a practical road map for a more functional and less dysfunctional global order.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The order seeks to prevent federal agents from being deputized, prohibits them from wearing masks to conceal their identity, and directs city departments to protect citizens from federal overreach. Johnson stated the city has received "highly credible reports" of imminent federal activity and will use all available legal tools, including lawsuits, to counter what he views as an authoritarian move by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. Del Toro described the project as a decades-long dream, emphasizing his desire to reconstruct the world on a grand scale with physical sets rather than relying heavily on CGI. The film, which runs for 149 minutes, explores the story from the perspectives of both the creator and the creature, aiming to humanize the monster.

          <p>This year's US Open has been characterized by a noticeable increase in on-court drama and player outbursts, with several high-profile incidents of anger drawing attention. The tension is attributed to a combination of factors, including the high-stakes pressure of the final Grand Slam of a long season, fatigue, and the famously intense New York City crowds that can amplify emotions. Recent confrontations, such as those involving Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, highlight a trend of heightened volatility among players. Fellow competitors suggest that while such behavior occurs on tour, the New York stage magnifies it for a wider audience.</p>

However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, a sentiment echoed by some local residents.

          <p>New evidence suggests that legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, whose life inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. The long-held belief was that she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but a renewed investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found major inconsistencies in his story. Modern forensic analysis, including a new autopsy on Pauline's exhumed remains, indicates the crime scene was staged and that a gunshot wound to Pusser's cheek was likely self-inflicted. Prosecutors believe they would have had enough evidence to indict Pusser for murder if he were alive today.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing two children and injuring eighteen other people before dying by suicide. The victims were identified as 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski. The 23-year-old shooter, a former student at the attached school, legally purchased three firearms recently and had an obsession with past mass shootings. Investigators are treating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime, citing anti-Catholic and other hateful writings left behind by the shooter in a pre-scheduled video manifesto.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on numerous countries, deeming most of them illegal. The court found that the President improperly used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that the constitutional power to impose tariffs rests exclusively with Congress. The decision places tariffs affecting a significant portion of U.S. imports on hold pending a potential appeal to the Supreme Court, though sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected. This ruling creates significant uncertainty for a key component of the administration's economic and trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While there are no universal rules, medical and psychological experts generally agree on precautionary principles for children's screen time based on developmental stages. For toddlers under three, a screen-free environment is recommended to encourage exploration and self-regulation of attention. For kindergarten-aged children, screen time should be limited to allow for the development of social skills and imagination through physical play. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to monitoring content and maintaining open communication, ensuring that digital consumption does not replace essential real-world interactions and activities.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook pose a significant threat to the central bank's independence. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its institutional integrity, leading to negative long-term economic consequences such as higher inflation, weaker market performance, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, she believes the eventual damage from sustained inflation and loss of credibility would be severe for the U.S. economy.

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against such a measure. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, but the council is now considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with protests and counter-demonstrations occurring across the country. Councils argue the use of hotels constitutes a breach of planning laws and creates public safety risks, while the government seeks to manage the housing of a record number of asylum applicants.</p>
