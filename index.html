          <p>Analysts warn that investors may underestimate the negative impact of potential pharmaceutical tariffs on companies like Bristol Myers Squibb.  The complexity of global pharmaceutical supply chains and tax strategies makes mitigation challenging.  While Bristol Myers claims its supply chain isn't overly reliant on any single country, sustained tariffs would likely increase drug costs for American consumers.  The CNBC Investing Club remains bullish on Bristol Myers Squibb long-term, but advises caution regarding current stock prices.  <i>(not investment advice)<br></i></p>
