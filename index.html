          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson discusses the recently passed tax and border bill, emphasizing its potential to stimulate the U.S. economy through tax reductions and deregulation. He argues that the bill, estimated to cost between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade, includes significant savings for the American people and investments in American energy and military infrastructure. Johnson defends the bill against criticisms from Senate Republicans, who express concerns about its impact on the national debt, and addresses concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food stamps by asserting that the bill targets fraud, waste, and abuse in these programs. He maintains that the bill will benefit all Americans and that concerns about tariffs are subsiding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Palestinian doctor's husband remains in critical condition after an Israeli strike in Gaza killed nine of their ten children. The husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, sustained severe injuries to his brain, lungs, arm, and kidney, according to medical staff at Nasser hospital. The couple's surviving 11-year-old son, Adam, was also injured but is reportedly doing reasonably well. The Israeli military stated that the incident is under review and that the strike targeted suspects operating near their troops in Khan Younis, which they consider a dangerous war zone. The Red Cross also reported the deaths of two of its staff members in a separate strike, underscoring the high civilian death toll in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to a report by Solutions for Our Climate. Japan benefits from LNG investments through increased access to supply and the ability to resell surplus LNG, shifting its role from consumer to exporter. While Japan promotes the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to cooperate on net-zero emissions, many projects focus on natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage (CCS) technology, raising concerns about greenwashing. Critics argue that LNG involves more emissions than coal and that loopholes in Japan's G7 pledge allow for continued investment in unabated fossil fuel projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on creating a secure environment for children to express their emotions freely. This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents, who are encouraged to accept their child's emotions without judgment and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents set boundaries with empathy rather than control, preventing shame by reconnecting after conflicts and modeling healthy repair. The framework involves parents doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame from taking place.</p>

He discovered the truck was gone when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage, which revealed a tow truck taking the vehicle.

Her efforts led to a fundamental change in the Army, with service members now personally notifying families and offering additional support. Her legacy is honored at Ft.

          <p>Republican senators, including Ron Johnson, are expressing concerns about the House's "big, beautiful bill" due to its potential impact on the national debt. Johnson believes there are enough GOP colleagues to stall the bill and demand changes to reduce spending and the deficit. This opposition underscores the challenges the bill faces in the Senate, where fiscal hawks are signaling they won't support the package in its current form. House Speaker Mike Johnson has urged his Senate colleagues not to "meddle" with the bill too much.</p>

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region, leading to a decrease in Israeli airstrikes on Syria. After meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, Trump announced plans to lift sanctions, a move that has undermined Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. Israeli officials express doubts about al-Shara's intentions, while Trump's actions reflect a reshaping of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Despite the change, Israel is still motivated to protect the Druze religious minority in Syria.</p>

Stephen Kerr, a Tory MSP, stated that councils are eager to participate in the SNP's war on motorists, while neglecting to address community pollution.

          <p>The Trump administration's monetization of the presidency has reached unprecedented levels, normalizing activities that would have previously triggered heavy scrutiny and investigations. The article indicates that the Trump family and its business partners have collected millions through cryptocurrency fees, real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. The president hosted investors in his personal cryptocurrency and Qatar has handed over a luxury jet, raising ethical concerns. The president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable to the president, which are not applicable to the president.</p>

          <p>Esai Morales reprises his role as Gabriel, the main antagonist, in "Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning," a film that he views as a "graduation" after years of production. Morales, known for his roles in "La Bamba" and "Mi Familia," makes franchise history as the first Latino lead in the action series. He describes Gabriel as the star of his own movie, playing the character with as much humanity as possible. The actor also praises the film's focus on the race to get the key rather than on race.</p>
