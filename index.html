CEO Jensen Huang noted the incredibly strong global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure. Nvidia's gaming division also saw a 42% increase in sales, and the automotive and robotics division experienced a 72% rise due to increased sales of chips and software for self-driving cars.

          <p>Sleep Token, an experimental British metal band known for its anonymity and cryptic lore, achieved the bestselling album in America with "Even In Arcadia." The album broke genre streaming records and became the bestselling hard-rock album since Metallica in 2023. The band's success, along with that of Ghost, indicates a shift in the metal genre, with streaming numbers resembling those of pop consumers. This trend suggests a changing of the guard in the genre, where rising acts can achieve chart milestones not seen since the nu-metal wave of the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted a full pardon to former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, who was convicted of tax fraud and related charges in 2014. The charges stemmed from Grimm's ownership of a Manhattan restaurant before joining Congress, where he was accused of underreporting wages and revenue. Grimm resigned from Congress in January 2015 and served eight months in prison. Before his election to Congress, Grimm was a former Marine and FBI agent.</p>
