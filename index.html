        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for twelve offshore wind power infrastructure projects across the United States. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the funds were "wasteful" and will be repurposed to upgrade ports and other maritime infrastructure where possible. This action is part of a broader campaign against renewable energy, which recently included halting work on a nearly completed wind project off the New England coast. Industry executives have expressed concern that these policies will ultimately lead to higher power prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal court has begun hearing arguments regarding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Donald Trump from firing her. Cook's lawsuit argues that the president lacks legal cause for her removal, which is based on allegations of mortgage fraud promoted by a political operative. The Department of Justice contended that the president has the discretion to determine cause, a point that could have significant implications for the Federal Reserve's independence. A ruling against Cook could allow Trump to nominate a majority of the Fed's board members.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that the American education system's prolonged focus on STEM and vocational training at the expense of the liberal arts has left citizens unprepared for self-governance. The author argues that humanities, particularly history and literature, are essential for developing critical thinking, historical literacy, and empathy, which are vital skills for a functioning democracy. The piece contends that this educational shift has made the public more susceptible to propaganda and political manipulation. It calls for a renewed emphasis on the liberal arts to safeguard political liberty and foster a more capable citizenry.</p>

          <p>In a recent television interview, House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed several national issues, defending the recent leadership changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a necessary shakeup. Regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files, Johnson suggested a floor vote to compel their release might not be necessary following a recent document handover to the House Oversight Committee. In the wake of the Minneapolis school shooting, he expressed openness to bipartisan solutions focused on mental health rather than new gun control legislation. The Speaker also defended President Trump's major tax and spending bill, asserting its benefits for all Americans.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 11:58:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK Court of Appeal ruling has permitted the government to continue housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel in Epping, providing a technical legal victory for the Home Office. The decision prevents a potential wave of similar legal challenges from other local councils that could have disrupted the asylum accommodation system. However, the ruling places the government in a difficult political position, as it had to argue in favor of using hotels, a policy it has promised to end. This outcome intensifies pressure on ministers to find alternative solutions amid criticism from both political opponents and human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts, certain stocks in the housing, finance, and dividend sectors may see significant benefits. Companies like Home Depot could gain from a rebound in the housing market, while financial institutions such as Capital One and Wells Fargo may profit from increased consumer spending and loan activity. The analysis also highlights that high-yield dividend stocks like Bristol Myers Squibb and Starbucks could become more attractive to investors compared to government bonds in a lower-rate environment.

The decision, made by Spain's digital transformation ministry, cited the need to maintain the country's "strategic autonomy" and digital strategy. This move reverses a previously approved plan and aligns Spain more closely with EU and U.S. positions, which have urged member states to remove the Chinese tech giant's equipment from their networks due to security concerns.

          <p>A new report supported by the United Nations indicates that over 14,000 migrants, predominantly Venezuelans, have abandoned their attempts to reach the U.S. and are traveling south since the Trump administration's immigration crackdown began. This "reverse flow" migration is a direct result of changes in U.S. policy that have made it nearly impossible for asylum seekers to enter the country legally. These returning migrants face extreme vulnerability, often with depleted funds and the risk of exploitation by criminal groups as they journey back through Central America and Colombia. Northward migration through the Darién Gap has consequently dropped by 97%.</p>

          <p>Climate change and rising global temperatures are contributing to an increased threat of Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. The bacteria thrives in warm water and can proliferate in human-made water systems like the cooling towers of large buildings, which are used more frequently during heatwaves. Recent outbreaks in New York City and London, Ontario have been traced to improperly maintained cooling towers. Health experts warn that as reliance on these systems grows, proper maintenance is crucial to prevent the spread of the waterborne illness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit doctors at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing or counseling on abortions, with an exception only for saving the mother's life. This move would reverse a 2022 Biden administration policy and applies even in cases of sexual assault and incest. The proposal has drawn nearly 20,000 public comments and significant criticism from abortion rights advocates and female veterans, who highlight the high rates of sexual assault within the military. Critics argue the rule is cruel and unsafe for a vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced plans to restore a controversial portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to its original place in the library at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The large canvas, which depicts an enslaved man holding Lee's horse, was removed in 2022 following a law mandating the removal of Confederate commemorations from military installations. This move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reinstate Confederate symbols, framing their removal as an erasure of history.

This promotion is part of a broader strategy to leverage traditional knowledge systems to build people-to-people ties, which can be more resilient than state-level relations. While its global industry is booming, critics point to issues of over-commercialization and cultural appropriation in the West.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber became the 21st player in MLB history to hit four home runs in a single game during a victory over the Atlanta Braves. In his final at-bat, he had a rare opportunity to hit a fifth home run but popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the lopsided game. This outcome averted a potential controversy, as a record-breaking fifth homer against a non-pitcher likely would have drawn criticism and claims of being a tainted accomplishment. Schwarber now leads the league with 49 home runs this season.</p>

Police have used tear gas and water cannons on crowds, while some protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails.

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a crucial inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, held steady in July with a 2.6% annual increase, matching the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose slightly to 2.9% from a year ago, its highest level since February. The data also revealed a 0.5% increase in consumer spending from June to July, suggesting robust consumer demand despite economic uncertainty. These figures indicate that while overall inflation has cooled, persistent underlying price pressures may lead the Fed to proceed cautiously with any potential interest rate cuts.

The company guided for third-quarter data center revenue to be flat sequentially, attributing the slowdown to the non-linear nature of its custom AI chip business.

While acknowledging the idea is controversial and the object is most likely a natural comet, Loeb argues that analyzing such objects from an open-minded perspective is a worthwhile exercise.
