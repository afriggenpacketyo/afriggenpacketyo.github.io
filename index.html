          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-related events this month, including a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser and a gala dinner for holders of the $TRUMP token. The latter event will grant access to Trump's inner circle based on the number of tokens held, sparking controversy and accusations of corruption. According to the project's website, the Trump Organization and affiliates control approximately 80% of the $TRUMP token supply. While the contest does not guarantee access to the president, the announcement has significantly increased demand for the token and trading activity, generating substantial fees for insiders.

          <p>Rwanda's Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungireh has confirmed that the country is in preliminary talks with the Trump administration to accept migrants deported by the U.S. This follows similar discussions with the UK, which were later abandoned by the Labour government. Nduhungireh stated that Rwanda believes in offering migrants a "second chance," but the outcome of the talks with the U.S. remains uncertain. The Trump administration has focused on speeding up the removal of undocumented migrants since taking office in January, with Rwanda previously criticized for its human rights record, though the country asserts it is a safe haven for refugees.</p>

          <p>Norwegian customs officials seized 147 kilos of cocaine hidden in a shipment of bananas, marking the largest seizure in the country since 2023. The drugs, with an estimated street value of $16.4 million, were found in nine boxes and are believed to have been smuggled from South America via sea and then through Sweden. Authorities suspect a large criminal network is behind the attempted smuggling, as such operations require significant financial and organizational resources.

Some analysts anticipate preemptive rate drops due to expected future rate cuts by the Fed. If the Fed chooses to lower the federal funds rate, CD interest rates are likely to follow suit, however, some experts suggest that the Fed is likely to keep interest rates frozen in May, given the ongoing economic uncertainty and the focus on further tempering inflation.

          <p>The Trump administration is restarting federal student loan collections for millions of borrowers in default after a five-year pause, despite sweeping changes and disruptions to the lending system. Borrowers face potential plan changes and long wait times for assistance, while those in default may see significant credit score declines. Experts warn that restarting collections amid uncertainty could exacerbate economic challenges for working families. The Student Borrower Protection Center criticizes the timing, given the need for borrowers to get help, especially as the administration has also terminated staff at the Education Department who assisted borrowers.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is experiencing a surge in sponsorships and stadium attendance, buoyed by the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S. and the arrival of Lionel Messi. Sponsorship revenue is up double digits compared to 2024, with brands like Michelob Ultra and Adidas investing heavily in the league. The upcoming 2026 World Cup, coupled with soccer's increasing cultural relevance, has fueled this growth. The league's success on social media and its appeal to younger, more diverse audiences are also attracting advertisers.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Harry's BBC interview, questions are being raised about the royal family's communication strategies, particularly their reliance on the motto "never complain, never explain." The interview, filled with both complaints and explanations, ultimately left many questions unanswered. King Charles, while nominally adhering to the rule, has had friends speak on his behalf, adding to the tawdriness. The article argues that the royals' legendary discretion often leads to larger, more difficult explanations later on, and that more open and relatable communication is needed.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares are under pressure following Warren Buffett's announcement that he will step down as CEO, with Greg Abel succeeding him on January 1, 2026. Class A shares dropped 6.2% after closing at a record high, and Class B shares also fell. While investors process the transition, analysts express confidence that Buffett will remain as chairman to mentor Abel and provide intellectual capacity. This transition marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet approved plans for an escalation of the military campaign in Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring that they have not finished the war. The logic appears to be that victory against Hamas will come from an even bigger barrage of military might in the weeks ahead. The question is whether a return to that kind of fighting is a road map to the end of hostilities or merely an intensification of a deadly conflict with worsening consequences for Palestinians and the Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas. Two reservists said that they had received call-up orders beginning in June.</p>
