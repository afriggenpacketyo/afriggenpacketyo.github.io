          <p>As China emphasizes STEM education, the role of humanities in universities is being reevaluated, with some universities reducing arts and social science enrollments. However, humanities departments are adapting by integrating AI and technology into interdisciplinary fields. Dean Wang Jun of Zhejiang University argues that humanities are crucial for addressing fundamental societal issues, providing long-term value beyond immediate GDP contributions. The article emphasizes that the humanities preserve the complexity and diversity of human civilization, which is a value that cannot be directly measured in economic terms.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most private school students and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, while home-schooled students will receive $2,000 a year. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools and primarily benefit wealthier families already in private education. Attorney General Ken Paxton stated that the bill is a historic step to ensure that students will have the freedom to seek the educational option that is right for them.</p>
