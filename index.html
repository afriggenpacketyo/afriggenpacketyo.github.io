          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which President Trump described as the "largest ever," involving reciprocal 15% tariffs. Japan is also set to invest $550 billion in the United States, a move projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. The agreement includes opening Japan's market to American cars, trucks, and agricultural products. This development comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority, potentially strengthening the U.S. negotiating position. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have taken the rare step of removing interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Trump appointee and his former personal lawyer, from her position. They appointed her top assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office, citing the expiration of Habba's 120-day interim term without Senate confirmation. The Trump administration quickly responded by removing Grace, with the Attorney General accusing the judges of being "rogue" and politically motivated. This clash highlights the ongoing friction between the judiciary and the executive branch.</p>

          <p>A House Appropriations Committee has advanced a Republican-led measure to rename the Kennedy Center's opera house after First Lady Melania Trump. The proposal, introduced by Rep. Mike Simpson, recognizes her role as the board's honorary chair. Democrats have criticized the move as divisive and a symptom of the Trump administration's increasing influence over the cultural institution. The renaming is part of a broader push by President Trump to reshape the Kennedy Center, which has included appointing allies to its board and criticizing its programming.</p>

The author argues these firings are part of a deliberate pattern by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to sideline women in the armed forces. The piece contends this sends a "chilling message" that women are not welcome in leadership roles, potentially harming both morale and recruitment.

          <p>China's ambitious Qianfan satellite internet project, intended to rival SpaceX's Starlink, may be facing significant delays due to a shortage of available rockets. The company behind the network, Shanghai Yuanxin Satellite Technology, has a tight schedule to deploy thousands of satellites to meet international regulatory deadlines. To achieve its goal of over 15,000 satellites by 2030, it needs to launch more than 30 per month. However, China's current rocket manufacturing and launch capacity is struggling to keep up with the high demand for satellite deployment.</p>
