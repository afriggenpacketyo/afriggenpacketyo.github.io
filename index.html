          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, stating the president's determination was "untethered to the facts." The judge, a Trump appointee, found no "colorable basis" to federalize the Guard, as demonstrations at the immigration facility were not significantly violent or disruptive. This landmark ruling highlights the complex intersection of federal-state relations, the role of the military in domestic law enforcement, and the balance of power among governmental branches. Oregon officials had strongly pushed back on the plans, asserting the state's capacity to manage public safety without federal interference and refuting the president's portrayal of the city.</p>

          <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents shot a woman in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and "boxed in by 10 cars." DHS initially claimed the incident occurred near an ICE facility in Broadview, stating one driver had a semi-automatic weapon, leading agents to open fire and strike the woman. Chicago police responded to document the shooting and manage traffic, but clarified they have no jurisdiction in Broadview and are not involved in the federal investigation. DHS further claimed the woman was previously identified in an intelligence bulletin for doxxing agents, though no corroborating information was released. The woman was treated and released from the hospital, and no agents sustained injuries during the confrontation.</p>

          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert is facing renewed scrutiny after past comments about Caitlin Clark's earning potential resurfaced, following her denial of alleged remarks to Lynx star Napheesa Collier. Collier claimed Engelbert said Clark "should be grateful" for her off-court earnings and that players should "thank their lucky stars" for the media rights deal. While Engelbert denied the Clark comments, her 2024 CNBC interview indicated Clark would "do just fine" with millions in endorsements, separate from her WNBA base salary. The controversy comes as the WNBA and its players' union negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement, with Engelbert acknowledging a need to "do better" if players feel unappreciated.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest US Lutheran denomination, has installed Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a landmark moment for the predominantly white church. Curry, 53, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first female leader, and expressed hope that his presence would encourage more leaders of color. His six-year term begins with goals to foster a more connected and welcoming church, addressing challenges such as membership decline and ongoing theological discussions on LGBTQ+ inclusion. Curry's unique journey, from growing up Catholic in Chicago to becoming a social worker and teacher before his ordination, highlights the ELCA's efforts to grow diverse congregations within its established structures.</p>

Demonstrators, waving rainbow and EU flags, strongly condemned Orban's government, accusing it of authoritarian tendencies. Despite the risk of significant fines for attendees, the march drew an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people, including several Members of the European Parliament, underscoring persistent resistance to the government's escalating restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and fundamental human freedoms.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced that the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members, condemning the ultimatum as "absolutely outrageous and un-American." The White House confirmed the plan, citing ongoing "violent riots and lawlessness" that local leaders like Pritzker allegedly failed to address. Pritzker, however, strongly asserted that there is "no need for military troops" in Illinois, emphasizing that state, county, and local law enforcement are effectively coordinating public safety efforts around the Broadview ICE facility and protecting constitutional rights. This federal action, amidst clashes between protesters and federal agents, is seen by Pritzker as a "manufactured performance" by Donald Trump for control, not a genuine effort to protect public safety.</p>

          <p>"Freshers' flu" is a widespread phenomenon among new university students, characterized by a rapid spread of common cold viruses within campus communities. Immunologists explain that students arriving from diverse locations introduce a "mixing pot" of infections, which, when combined with close living quarters, crowded lectures, and shared amenities, facilitates quick transmission. The article highlights that contributing factors like academic stress, an often-poor diet, insufficient sleep, and alcohol consumption significantly weaken the immune system, rendering students more vulnerable to illness. Although typically not serious, the initial exposure to many novel viruses can lead to persistent symptoms, underscoring the importance of adequate rest and self-care during this demanding transitional phase.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement" and hopes to announce the return of all hostages "in the coming days." He indicated that in the first phase of the US-backed peace proposal, Hamas would release all hostages, while IDF forces would redeploy but maintain control deep within Gaza. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Hamas to "move quickly, or else all bets will be off," as his special envoy and Jared Kushner head to Egypt for negotiations. The halt in IDF offensive activity is intended to allow Hamas to organize hostage releases, though Israel maintains it's not an official ceasefire or withdrawal.</p>

Her political inspiration stemmed from observing US-Japan trade friction in the 1980s, leading her to believe Japan needed to defend itself.

His extensive career in football also saw him own Leicester City and Sheffield Wednesday, eventually selling them to new investors. Beyond club ownership, Mandaric founded successful computer-components firms in the US and was famously acquitted of tax evasion alongside Harry Redknapp in 2012, leaving a significant legacy in the sport.</p>

          <p>Prince William has described the nominees for his environmental Earthshot Prize as "heroes of our time" as he prepares to travel to Rio de Janeiro for the awards ceremony. This marks the first time the prize, which annually awards £1m to five projects for their environmental innovations, will be hosted in Latin America. With nearly 2,500 nominees from 72 countries, this year's finalists range from Barbados's global climate leadership to Guangzhou's public transport electrification and a British business developing a microplastics filter. Prince William underscored the critical importance of the 2030 environmental threshold, asserting that current actions will irrevocably shape the planet's future trajectory for generations to come.</p>

          <p>Nearly 500 people were arrested in central London during protests in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action, despite urgent pleas from ministers and police to postpone demonstrations following the deadly Manchester synagogue attack. Organizers, Defend Our Juries, reported approximately 1,000 participants, with the Metropolitan Police confirming 488 arrests, primarily for supporting a proscribed organization. The Met deployed 1,500 officers, noting that many individuals had to be physically carried out of Trafalgar Square. Human rights groups like Amnesty International UK criticized these arrests as a breach of international human rights obligations. This event underscores significant tensions between freedom of protest, national security concerns, and the sensitive emotional context of recent tragic events.</p>

          <p>Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts have ignited title aspirations among their fans after securing a 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner, extending their lead to five points. Head coach Derek McInnes, while professionally cautious about title talk, acknowledged the fans' right to excitement following the team's stunning unbeaten start. The early-season optimism in Gorgie is significantly bolstered by a £10m investment from Tony Bloom, the Brighton owner, who boldly claimed Hearts are in a position to challenge for second this season. With rivals Rangers in turmoil and reigning champions Celtic yet to hit top gear, many now consider this ambitious assessment increasingly realistic, despite the historical challenges of maintaining such form in the league.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach proceeded without its customary US military aircraft due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, disappointing thousands of attendees. Airshow Director Kevin Elliott confirmed the absence of US military assets, leaving spectators to rely on British Royal Air Force and Canadian Armed Forces as substitutes for the anticipated displays. For many, including veterans, the absence of powerful US jets, particularly F-35s and Thunderbirds, was a significant letdown, evoking strong emotional responses and a sense of loss. Despite the reduced US military presence, the article notes the event still drew large crowds and featured impressive international and historical aviation displays, but it clearly underscored the tangible impact of federal funding impasses on public events and national pride.</p>

          <p>Liverpool, the reigning Premier League champions, have suffered consecutive defeats due to late goals, losing 2-1 to Chelsea and 1-0 to Crystal Palace, highlighting a significant shift in their fortunes. Manager Arne Slot noted that while his team created more chances, "fine margins" haven't favored them recently. This contrasts sharply with their early season, where late goals often secured wins, but also masked underlying indifferent form. The article suggests that an influx of new signings has left Liverpool unbalanced, particularly defensively, and that their status as champions now makes them a prime target for rivals. This marks the worst week for Slot since taking over, emphasizing the need for a turnaround after the international break.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has pledged to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election, as part of a new, tougher borders plan. The proposals include banning individuals who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and transferring the appeals process to Home Office officials, abolishing the Immigration Tribunal. The party intends to rebrand its immigration enforcement unit as a "Removals Force," doubling its funding to £1.6bn annually and mandating the removal of at least 150,000 people per year. This ambitious target, representing a five-fold increase from current figures, draws inspiration from US immigration enforcement policies and seeks to address public concerns over migration.</p>

          <p>Iran has executed six death-row inmates it alleged carried out attacks in the country's oil-rich southwest on behalf of Israel, marking the latest in a wave of executions believed to be the highest in decades. The individuals were accused of killing police and security forces and orchestrating bombings targeting sites around Khorramshahr in Khuzestan province. Human rights groups, including the Hengaw Organization, reported the men were "Arab political prisoners" detained during 2019 protests, subjected to severe torture and coerced televised confessions. Activists warn Iran frequently relies on closed-door trials and forced confessions in death penalty cases, particularly those involving alleged links to Israel, raising significant international human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Hamas to "move quickly" on the latest Gaza peace plan, warning that "all bets will be off" if there is any delay, as US negotiators, including Jared Kushner, travel to Cairo. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope that all remaining hostages, both living and deceased, would be returned by October 13, the end of the Sukkot holiday. The White House's 20-point plan, partially accepted by Hamas, requires the immediate release of hostages within three days and a halt to Israeli bombing. Despite a reported "significant" reduction in Israeli strikes in Gaza City, the Health Ministry reported ongoing deaths, highlighting the extreme fragility of the situation and the complex challenges in finalizing a comprehensive and lasting deal.</p>

While head coach Ruben Amorim acknowledged the immense pressure on goalkeepers and Lammens' need for continued adaptation, he praised his comfortable performance. This debut contributed to United's third consecutive home win, offering a glimmer of hope and a positive score for the team amid an otherwise challenging season.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces pressure from the US and G7 nations to reduce its significant reliance on Russian oil and gas, with over 66% of its oil imports and 41% of natural gas imports coming from Russia last year. While President Trump explicitly demanded Turkey stop these purchases, Turkey has not yet responded, benefiting from lower Russian energy prices post-Ukraine invasion. Instead of outright cessation, Turkey is quietly pursuing a diversification strategy, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms. This strategic shift aims to enhance energy security and improve relations with the US, even as Turkey continues its complex energy balancing act, including Russian assistance for its first nuclear power plant.</p>

          <p>Jack Daniel's distillery has ended its 45-year tradition of providing free spent grain for cattle feed to local Tennessee farmers, a decision that threatens to devastate their businesses and the local town. The company, owned by Louisville-based Brown-Forman, states this change is essential to meet global environmental goals and maintain its ability to sell whiskey internationally, transitioning to a new anaerobic digester facility for sustainability. Farmers, many with deep personal and historical ties to the distillery, feel betrayed, perceiving it as a departure from the small-town Tennessee values the brand cultivated. This situation highlights a growing tension in rural America between corporate sustainability objectives and the economic survival of long-standing community relationships.</p>

However, digital pianos offer a more affordable, smaller, and acoustically accurate alternative, making the instrument accessible to new learners and addressing issues older acoustic pianos might pose. Experts express optimism for a resurgence in piano playing, believing that as people grow weary of screens, they will increasingly seek the musicality and emotional expression offered by instruments, regardless of their format.</p>
