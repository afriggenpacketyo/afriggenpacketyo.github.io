          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:40:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has withdrawn Alina Habba's formal nomination for U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, a strategic move that allows her to continue serving in an acting capacity. This decision circumvents a federal law that would have limited her tenure and follows a contentious power struggle with New Jersey's federal district court, which had attempted to install her deputy in the position. The Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, has strongly supported Habba, accusing the judges of political interference. The withdrawal negates the need for Senate confirmation, which was unlikely due to opposition from New Jersey's Democratic senators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of job listings mentioning artificial intelligence has surged, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years, according to a new report from the Brookings Institution. In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings have more than doubled as companies increasingly integrate the technology into their operations. These roles, which span from specialized AI engineers to general software developers, offer an average pay premium of 28% compared to similar jobs without an AI requirement. While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, AI-related jobs are expanding beyond tech hubs into other sectors like finance and marketing.</p>

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the Chief People Officer at tech startup Astronomer, has resigned from the company. Her departure follows the resignation of CEO Andy Byron days earlier, after the two were featured in an intimate moment on the 'kiss cam' at a Coldplay concert. A video of the incident, in which the married CEO and Cabot appeared to hide from the camera, went viral on social media. The company confirmed Cabot's resignation, marking the second executive departure related to the event. Both Cabot and Byron have since been removed from the company's official leadership webpage.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, is launching a new political party aimed at challenging the 'rich and powerful' and promoting wealth redistribution. Acting as an independent Member of Parliament, Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, announced the initiative to create a 'community-led, grassroot-led' alternative to what they describe as Labour's centralized control. The yet-to-be-named party intends to contest issues like child poverty and corporate profits, positioning itself to the left of the current Labour Party. The move could potentially split the left-wing vote and impact Labour's standing in future elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The legal action follows a recent incident where an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the lawsuit aims to protect citizens from criminals released due to these policies. The Trump administration has been particularly critical of the city's refusal to allow ICE agents access to Rikers Island to identify and detain undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, vowing to increase federal agent presence in response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed into law a rescissions package that claws back approximately $9 billion in previously approved federal funding. The measure primarily targets foreign aid, revoking nearly $8 billion from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and also cuts over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The legislation passed through Congress on a narrow, party-line vote in the Senate. Republicans championed the bill as a necessary step toward fiscal responsibility, while Democrats warned that the cuts could undermine U.S. national security and set a dangerous precedent for defunding congressionally appropriated programs.</p>

In an interview, Johnson expressed his belief that rates should be lowered to address issues like the housing affordability crisis, even while acknowledging that such a move is unconventional when the economy is strong. He stopped short of endorsing the president's threats to fire Powell, noting uncertainty about the legal parameters of such an action.

          <p>A new report reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, highlighting the state's severe and ongoing housing affordability crisis. The data shows significant regional disparities, with investor ownership reaching as high as 83% in rural Sierra County, while urban centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco have lower but still substantial rates around 15-16%. While the state's overall percentage is just below the national average, the sheer volume of 1.45 million investor-owned homes puts upward pressure on prices in a market already suffering from a major housing shortage. Critics argue this trend undermines affordability, even as investors provide market liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal offers water agencies two compliance pathways: a traditional regulatory approach based on river flow levels, or an alternative allowing them to meet goals through negotiated 'voluntary agreements' that combine reduced water flow commitments with funding for habitat restoration. While major water agencies support this flexibility, environmental groups and Delta communities argue it will harm the fragile ecosystem and endangered fish species by failing to mandate sufficient freshwater flows, potentially enabling more water diversions.</p>

This move follows a recent Supreme Court decision that permits cities to penalize individuals for sleeping in public, even without available shelter. Critics argue this approach criminalizes homelessness and exacerbates the crisis, which is primarily driven by a severe shortage of affordable housing across the country.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Tesla's financial decisions shows the company missed out on billions in potential profit by selling 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022. The electric vehicle maker sold the assets when the cryptocurrency market was plunging, but Bitcoin has since rebounded to near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its full investment, its holdings would be worth approximately $5 billion today instead of their current value of $1.24 billion. While the company's digital assets still contributed $284 million in gains in the last quarter, the premature sale represents a significant lost opportunity as the company faces struggles in its core auto business.

          <p>Stellantis is recalling more than 121,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L vehicles from the 2023-2024 model years due to faulty second-row headrests. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the headrests may fail to lock in the upright position, potentially increasing the risk of injury to passengers during a crash. The company will notify owners by mail in early September. To resolve the issue, dealers will inspect the headrests and, if necessary, replace them free of charge. This recall addresses a specific safety concern related to the vehicle's passive restraint systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at curbing the influence of booster-funded 'pay-for-play' deals in college sports. The directive prohibits third-party Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) payments used as recruiting inducements, seeking to restore competitive balance and financial stability to collegiate athletics. The order also mandates that athletic departments protect and, in some cases, expand opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports. Citing a 'chaotic environment' created by conflicting state laws, the administration's action represents a significant federal intervention into the rapidly commercializing world of college football and basketball.</p>

The festival was renowned for its two-stage format that helped launch the careers of many new artists. Despite its success, the tour eventually ended in 2018 due to rising costs and disagreements with band managers over compensation.</p>

Federal Reserve data indicates that only about 1.3% to 1.5% of U.S. households have a total net worth of $4 million or more. The median retirement savings for Americans is a much more modest $86,900. This article suggests the $4 million benchmark is often promoted by retirement calculators from investment firms, which may overestimate needs and create unnecessary anxiety.
