          <p>Iran and the United States commenced a third round of discussions regarding Iran's nuclear program, aiming to establish a new agreement that could prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump, who previously withdrew from the 2018 nuclear deal, expressed optimism about reaching a new accord. A successful agreement could reshape regional and global security by mitigating the risk of a U.S.-backed Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, as well as potentially easing economic sanctions and opening the country to foreign investors.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is experiencing significant strain due to workforce reductions initiated by the Trump administration, leading to burnout and overwhelmed employees. The SSA plans to cut approximately 12% of its workforce, impacting field offices that serve as the primary point of contact for 73 million Americans. These cuts have resulted in increased wait times for phone services and in-person assistance, with some offices losing a substantial portion of their staff. Advocates argue that these service cuts effectively reduce benefits, despite the administration's promises not to cut Social Security benefits directly. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>Three federal judges have temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools.
