          <p>President Trump unveiled a plan to develop a missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," aimed at detecting and intercepting incoming missiles, including those from space. Trump requested an initial $25 billion for the program, aiming for it to be fully operational by the end of his term, citing its importance for national survival. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth added that the system would protect against various threats, including cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles. Russia and China have criticized the plan, viewing it as destabilizing and a potential battlefield in space, while domestic Democrats have raised concerns about the procurement process and the involvement of companies like SpaceX.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio countered claims that the U.S. is retreating from global humanitarian assistance and human rights commitments, asserting that China cannot replace the U.S. as a global aid leader. Speaking at congressional hearings, Rubio dismissed China's Belt and Road Initiative as "predatory lending" rather than humanitarian aid. He refuted arguments that cuts to USAID are allowing China to surpass the U.S. in development sectors, highlighting his recent travels to numerous countries as evidence of continued U.S. engagement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston accused the Trump administration of violating a previous order by deporting a Burmese immigrant to South Sudan without proper due process. Judge Murphy had issued an order requiring the administration to give immigrants 15 days' notice before deporting them to countries other than their own, allowing them to raise concerns about potential danger. Lawyers claim that a Burmese man was deported to South Sudan despite the order, and a Vietnamese man suffered a similar fate. Judge Murphy ordered a Justice Department lawyer to track down the plane and threatened officials with contempt if the ruling was not followed.</p>

          <p>Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat from New Jersey, has been charged with two counts of assault after a confrontation with officers outside an immigration detention center in Newark. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and other lawmakers attempted to conduct an oversight visit at the facility. The complaint alleges that McIver pushed ICE agents and interfered with the arrest of Newark's mayor, Ras Baraka. McIver denies the allegations, calling the charges politically motivated and an attempt to intimidate Congress. The Department of Justice has dropped trespassing charges against Mayor Baraka.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te is entering his second year in office facing increasing political challenges both domestically and internationally. The recent breakthrough in US-China trade negotiations highlights the reality that even Washington, Taiwan's closest supporter, is willing to prioritize deals with Beijing. Lai's efforts to strengthen Taiwan's military readiness have been met with a lukewarm response from the White House, while domestic initiatives face opposition-controlled legislature. Analysts suggest that Lai's American strategy has been ineffective, and his perceived inflexibility has deepened the challenges of his first year in power.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of nicotine pouches by young people as an alternative to vaping is raising concerns about addiction and potential health risks. While some individuals use pouches to quit vaping, they often develop a new addiction, with some pouches containing significantly more nicotine than cigarettes. Health experts warn about the addictive nature and harmful side effects of these largely unregulated products. With a ban on disposable vapes coming into effect, there are fears that more young people will turn to these stronger nicotine pouches, marketed towards young people on social media and sometimes given away at railway stations.</p>

Critics have raised concerns about his mental and physical fitness for office, citing instances of cognitive decline and physical deterioration described in a new book.

Economists worry that high debt levels could lead to higher interest rates, making it harder for the government to borrow during crises.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, stating it was the president's right to deport people, leading to immediate correction from Senator Maggie Hassan. Noem's misunderstanding of the constitutional principle that protects against unlawful detention prompted criticism and concerns about her understanding of fundamental legal rights. During the same hearing, Noem denied any knowledge of a proposed reality television show featuring immigrants competing for U.S. citizenship, dismissing reports as inaccurate and false.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration outlined new regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, establishing stricter approval standards for healthy individuals. The agency now requires clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children.

The new guidelines aim to balance regulatory flexibility with a commitment to scientific rigor, potentially impacting revenue for vaccine manufacturers but also easing concerns about overgeneralizations on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with advanced prostate cancer has spurred questions about screening practices and the progression of the disease. Biden's spokesperson confirmed that he was diagnosed recently, with the cancer having metastasized to his bones. Experts note that screenings are not routinely recommended for men over 70, likely explaining why he did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in 2024. The diagnosis came after Biden experienced urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule in the prostate, which prompted further evaluation. Medical professionals emphasize the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, considering symptoms and overall health.</p>
