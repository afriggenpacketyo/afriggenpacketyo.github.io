          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is in South Africa to strengthen ties amidst Russia's growing influence in Africa. This visit highlights Ukraine's renewed focus on African diplomacy after previous neglect, now doubling its embassies on the continent. The visit is particularly significant given strained relations with the US under President Trump, who has criticized Zelensky and paused military aid. For South Africa's President Ramaphosa, the visit is equally important as his country faces pressure from the US, leading both nations to seek new alliances in a changing global landscape.</p>

          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who initially tricked her way into the men-only Magic Circle by disguising herself as a man, is finally being granted membership. She was expelled in 1991 after revealing her deception, the same meeting in which women were first admitted. The Magic Circle has now apologized and is presenting her with a membership certificate, recognizing her as a role model for women magicians. This comes after a public search for Lloyd and acknowledges the legacy of Jenny Winstanley, who helped orchestrate the original deception.</p>

          <p>Denise Fergus, the mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, is urging the government to enact a new law to curb AI-generated videos depicting child murder victims. She cited TikTok's slow response to removing videos showing digital clones of her son discussing his abduction. While the government claims such videos are illegal under the Online Safety Act, Fergus believes current laws are insufficient.
