          <p>Over 20 people were arrested in London for protesting in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Metropolitan Police stated that expressing support for the group is now a criminal offense, following a High Court decision to uphold the ban. This designation came after Palestine Action claimed responsibility for an estimated £7 million in damage to military aircraft, predominantly targeting arms companies since the Gaza conflict began. Critics, including the group's barrister, labeled the ban an "ill-considered" and "authoritarian abuse" of power, underscoring the contentious legal and public response to pro-Palestinian activism in the UK and raising questions about freedom of expression.</p>

          <h2>Harrowing Survival Accounts Emerge from Deadly Texas Floods as Search for Missing Continues</h2>

          <p>As the Texas Hill Country floods claim at least 27 lives, harrowing stories of survival are emerging alongside desperate pleas for missing loved ones. One young woman was dramatically rescued after being carried 12 miles down the Guadalupe River, while another man reportedly died saving his fiancée and children. Officials confirmed a flood watch was issued, but the area, known as "flood alley," lacked a comprehensive warning system, exacerbating the impact of the unexpected torrential rain. The article highlights the profound human toll, detailing specific missing individuals and families, including children from Camp Mystic, and the ongoing search and rescue efforts amidst widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>Texas has commenced a somber recovery effort after a catastrophic flash flood claimed at least 27 lives, including nine children, with dozens still unaccounted for, particularly from Camp Mystic. The Guadalupe River rapidly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, causing widespread devastation. Rescuers are employing helicopters and drones in ongoing search operations, though the confirmed death toll is likely to increase. The article critically examines the National Weather Service's forecast accuracy and the potential implications of recent federal budget cuts, while emphasizing the region's "flash flood alley" characteristic that exacerbates such natural disasters.</p>

          <p>An email from the US Social Security Administration (SSA) claiming President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients has been widely criticized as misleading. SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano lauded the bill as a "historic step forward," but critics, including former SSA officials and a Democratic congressman, swiftly labeled it "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The legislation actually provides a temporary tax deduction for seniors, with benefits phasing out for higher incomes, rather than a full elimination. This incident raises significant concerns about the politicization of a traditionally apolitical agency and the transparency of government communications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-lost 1940s Chinese typewriter, the "MingKwai" prototype invented by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered, illuminating a crucial chapter in the origins of modern Chinese computing. Previously believed lost, the machine's innovative design, which categorized Chinese pictographs by shape rather than sound, profoundly influenced how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The article highlights Lin's ambitious vision to integrate Eastern culture with Western technology, ensuring the preservation of the Chinese language in the digital age. This significant discovery by Stanford University scholars reveals a vital piece of technological history and Lin's globalist ambitions.</p>

          <p>An Arizona renter, Adrian Paull, claims he was fined $4,000 by his property manager, Denali Real Estate, for leaving negative online reviews about his Scottsdale condo, citing issues like black mold and unresolved repairs. The fine was imposed based on a lease clause prohibiting negative reviews or ratings below three stars, with a $2,000 penalty per occurrence. The article emphasizes that such "gag clauses" are illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act, which protects consumers' right to honest feedback. While Denali Real Estate has since announced they will remove the clause, the dispute over the imposed charges against Paull remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>A doctor from a public hospital in California highlights the severe obstacles faced by Medicaid patients, arguing that new congressional work requirements will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. While exemptions exist for medical conditions, many patients, such as a wheelchair-bound man living in shelters without a fixed address or phone, lack the resources to prove their eligibility. The article warns that these "time tax" bureaucratic barriers could lead to nearly 12 million Americans losing insurance by 2034, potentially causing financial disaster for safety-net hospitals and leaving the poorest without essential care.

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a happiness researcher and former Google X executive, proposes a "90-second rule" as a practical method for managing anger and upset, drawing on insights from neuroscience. The rule suggests allowing a minute and a half for stress and anger hormones to naturally flush from the body, then consciously choosing to shift focus away from repetitive negative thoughts. Gawdat, who began researching happiness after his son's tragic death, uses three guiding questions to aid this process: "Is it true?", "Can I do something about it?", and "Can I accept it and do something despite its presence?" This article offers a mindful approach to emotional regulation for a better, more fulfilled life.</p>
