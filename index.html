          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high, closing its tenth consecutive session of gains. The surge followed an announcement from the finance minister that the government would abandon its plan to increase taxes on stock investments. This news boosted investor confidence, leading to a 0.35% rise in the main index, while the small-cap Kosdaq also saw gains. The market's performance stands in contrast to mixed results across the broader Asia-Pacific region, as investors monitor U.S.-China trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is confronting growing discontent within his Labour party regarding his decision to dismiss Peter Mandelson, the US ambassador. The sacking followed revelations of supportive emails Mandelson sent concerning convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Some Labour MPs are now publicly questioning Starmer's leadership, with one backbencher suggesting he could be ousted if upcoming local elections go poorly. The controversy adds to internal party tensions ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit this week.</p>

Despite this, they have been found on sites like eBay and Shein for as little as £12.50, posing a lethal risk.

          <p>China is considering a novel approach to decarbonization by converting its retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for nuclear reactors. The "Coal-to-Nuclear" (C2N) initiative, proposed by a state-owned energy group, would utilize existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions, for new fourth-generation nuclear reactors. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal power capacity expected to be retired by 2030, this strategy could offer a direct path to reducing carbon emissions.

          <h2>Analyst Argues Trump's Unpredictable Foreign Policy Is Forcing Global Realignment Among Allies</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's erratic foreign policy is causing a significant global realignment, as even close U.S. allies feel compelled to form new blocs for stability. The article points to recent examples, such as Israel's strike in the allied nation of Qatar and the imposition of punitive tariffs on India, as actions that undermine traditional alliances. It suggests that nations are realizing that no amount of investment in a relationship with Trump guarantees security, leading to new diplomatic overtures between former rivals.</p>

Atlanta's offense was powered by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed for 143 yards. The game was largely a field goal battle until a late fourth-quarter touchdown by Atlanta's Tyler Allgeier sealed the win.</p>
