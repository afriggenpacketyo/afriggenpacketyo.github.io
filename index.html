These events have intensified investor anxiety about the health of the credit market, particularly in the opaque private credit sector.

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the average annual percentage rates (APRs) on consumer credit cards have not decreased proportionally, remaining near record highs. Analysts explain that card issuers are mitigating risk by maintaining high rates, especially for less creditworthy borrowers, and some retail cards have even increased APRs. For consumers carrying a balance, the relief from Fed cuts is minimal, making high-cost debt a persistent issue for many American households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, one of National Public Radio's original staff members and the first woman to anchor a nightly national news program in the U.S., has passed away at the age of 87.

Known for her wide-ranging curiosity and human-centric stories, from interviewing jazz legends to famously sharing her mother-in-law's cranberry relish recipe, her influence on public radio is considered foundational.</p>

          <p>While debt settlement can reduce balances for unsecured debts like credit cards, many types of financial obligations do not qualify for such programs. This article explains that secured debts, including mortgages and auto loans where collateral can be repossessed, are typically excluded. Additionally, government-backed obligations such as federal student loans, tax debts owed to the IRS, and court-ordered payments like child support and alimony cannot be negotiated down through traditional debt settlement companies.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. considers supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, military experts highlight their potential to shift the dynamics of the war with Russia. These long-range, subsonic cruise missiles are difficult for Russian air defenses to intercept due to their ability to fly at very low altitudes while navigating terrain. Their deployment would enable Ukrainian forces to strike high-value military targets, such as arms factories and airbases, deep within Russian territory, creating significant strategic pressure on Moscow.</p>
