          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order reviving the "most favored nation" policy, aiming to lower U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower prices in foreign countries. White House officials stated that foreign nations have been exploiting the American people, forcing them to pay excessively for prescription drugs. The order will direct various agencies to crack down on unreasonable policies suppressing drug prices abroad and encourage most favored nation pricing, potentially leading to negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry and possible tariffs if progress is not made. The industry argues that the policy would hurt profits and research capabilities, while patient advocates believe it could make medications more affordable.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced the launch of their direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, before the NFL season. The service will be priced in line with wholesale rates paid by pay-TV distributors, offering cable subscribers access at no extra cost. Murdoch emphasized the company's goal is to avoid losing traditional cable subscribers to Fox One, while also exploring partnerships with other distributors. This decision follows Fox's abandonment of the Venu joint venture sports streaming app with Warner Bros.

The indictment alleges a pattern of abuse toward women, manipulating them into commercial sex acts, and using money, drugs, and threats to maintain control. A key piece of evidence is a 2016 security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating efforts to eradicate homeless encampments by urging cities and counties to ban tent camps on public property. While Newsom cannot force cities to adopt his model ban, he is releasing over $3 billion in state-controlled housing funds to incentivize local governments to implement the ordinance. The move reflects a shift in the Democratic party's approach to homelessness, as the model ordinance would make homeless encampments a crime, although it does not specify criminal penalties. The governor's initiative comes amid rising frustration over the persistence of homelessness in California.</p>

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a reduction in reciprocal tariffs, effectively lowering U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% and China's levies on American imports to 10%. The agreement follows increased trade barriers that had virtually frozen trade between the two countries. This development has boosted commodities and currency markets, with stock futures soaring in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The FAA is considering reducing flights at Newark Liberty International Airport after recent equipment failures and air traffic controller shortages led to numerous flight disruptions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized the need to modernize aging U.S. aviation infrastructure, highlighting that similar issues could arise at other airports. A recent incident involved air traffic controllers losing the ability to communicate with planes, causing significant delays and prompting trauma leave for some controllers. Runway construction at Newark has also contributed to the ongoing issues.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is voicing strong opposition to President Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications, fearing it will negatively impact research and development. Trump's proposal aims to tie the price of certain Medicare-covered drugs to the lowest price paid by other countries. The industry argues this approach will cut billions from Medicare and jeopardize investments in innovative medicines, potentially increasing reliance on China. However, Trump maintains the policy will lower drug costs and treat the U.S. fairly, though the savings may not be seen by all Americans.</p>

The price increase comes after oil prices had plunged to a four-year low, due to President Trump's global tariff regime raising the risk of a recession.
