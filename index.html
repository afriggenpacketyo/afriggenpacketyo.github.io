        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions across the UK are bracing for extensive travel disruption over the upcoming bank holiday weekend, due to a combination of busy roads, a planned rail strike by the RMT union, and ongoing engineering works. Significant impacts are expected on CrossCountry rail routes, with no services on Saturday and limited operations on Monday, while the RAC warns of particularly heavy traffic on key motorways like the M5. Despite these transport challenges, the weather is forecast to be largely dry, encouraging large attendances at numerous festivals and events nationwide, including Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals. This period marks the final long weekend before Christmas for many regions.</p>

          <p>Pet dogs are becoming integral to wedding ceremonies, often serving as ring bearers, greeters, and participants in family portraits, reflecting their growing status as cherished family members. Couples like Ellie and Brad, whose sheepadoodle Newton played multiple roles, highlight the joy and emotional support these animals bring to special occasions. Services like Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party have emerged to help couples incorporate their pets, managing logistics and even "sprucing up" dogs with special attire. This trend signifies a broader cultural shift where pets are deeply embedded in family life, inspiring others to include their beloved companions in significant life events.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 04:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe is currently enduring a prolonged and intense summer heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 36 degrees Celsius in cities like Madrid and Paris. This extreme weather, linked to global warming, has highlighted the continent's lack of infrastructure for such high temperatures, despite its typically northern latitude. As a direct result, demand for air conditioning units has skyrocketed, leading to a nearly 60% increase in Chinese AC exports to Europe in July compared to the previous year. This surge is significantly boosting business for Chinese manufacturers, who produce about 80% of the world's cooling units.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Karachi, Pakistan, resulted in at least four fatalities and over 30 injuries on Thursday. The blast ignited a fire that engulfed the warehouse and nearby shops, also damaging vehicles in the Jinnah Road area. The force of the explosion shattered windows in surrounding buildings, causing widespread panic. Authorities have arrested two warehouse owners, stating that raw materials for fireworks, potentially also used for bombs, were illegally stored in the basement. This incident echoes a similar explosion in January in Punjab province that killed six people, highlighting ongoing safety concerns in Pakistan's financial capital.</p>

London's FTSE 100 led losses, while the German DAX also fell. The agreement confirmed that EU pharmaceuticals exported to the US would face a 15% tariff cap, alleviating fears of much higher rates. However, automotive stocks closed negatively as duties on European car exports will only be reduced once Brussels lowers its own industrial duties. This complex deal, alongside a sharper-than-expected contraction in Germany's GDP, contributed to market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement specifies that the US will apply the 15% rate on most European goods, including semiconductors and lumber, from September 1. In return, the EU is expected to reduce tariffs on all US industrial and agricultural goods to zero, with a conditional reduction for European car exports pending this legislative action.

          <p>US stocks have fallen for five straight days as traders nervously await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole economic summit, hoping for indications on future interest rate cuts. Despite repeated calls from President Donald Trump for rate reductions, the Fed has held rates steady for five consecutive meetings. Other Fed officials, like Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, express caution, stating they see no immediate case for cuts. Concerns over the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation, as highlighted by Walmart's warnings about squeezed profit margins, further contribute to market anxiety ahead of Powell's address.

          <p>Adidas executives have publicly apologized to the Indigenous town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for creating a shoe design, the "Oaxaca Slip-On," that closely resembled traditional huarache sandals from the community. The company admitted the design was inspired by the town's tradition and acknowledged the discomfort caused by cultural appropriation. Adidas pledged future collaboration with the community, which relies on handicrafts for its livelihood. This apology follows national attention and criticism from President Claudia Sheinbaum, who advocated for stronger protections against global brands copying Indigenous designs, calling for compensation and adherence to heritage law.</p>

These cases, split between north-central and south-central Kansas, are below last year's total of 64 infections and four deaths. However, health officials warn that the risk is expected to rise as mosquito activity peaks in late summer, typically from August to early September. The CDC reports that while most infected individuals recover, neuroinvasive cases can lead to disorientation, paralysis, and vision loss, emphasizing the need for public awareness during this high-risk period.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole by California officials after a nearly 10-hour hearing, decades after he and his brother Lyle murdered their parents in 1989. The parole panel cited Menendez's "behavior in prison," including multiple violations since 2013, as the primary reason for denial, despite his family's support. Menendez will have to wait three years for his next hearing. While acknowledging the alleged sexual assault, physical, and emotional abuse claimed by the brothers as self-defense, the panel concluded that their actions were not justified, describing his mother's murder as "devoid of human compassion."</p>
