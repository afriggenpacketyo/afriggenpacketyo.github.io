        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Super Micro shares experienced a significant drop after the company released preliminary financial results for the fiscal third quarter that fell short of analysts' expectations. The company cited delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves as contributing factors to the lowered projections, implying a growth slowdown from the previous year. This news also impacted shares of competitor companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which saw declines in after-hours trading. The lowered guidance raises concerns about Super Micro's ability to sustain its previous high growth rates in the competitive server market.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order adjusting some automotive tariffs put in place earlier in April, aiming to alleviate regulatory uncertainty and costs for the car industry. While tariffs on imported vehicles will remain, the order seeks to reduce the overall tariff burden by offering partial reimbursements on tariffs for auto parts used in U.S.-assembled vehicles. This offer is retroactive to the tariffs' initial implementation and will last for two years, offering financial assistance to automakers during this transitional period. The administration hopes to help the industry cope with part shortages by easing the tariff burden.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock price plummeted after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Snap anticipates daily active users to be near the midpoint of its projected range, but the company is cautious about advertising demand due to evolving economic conditions. The company lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses and stock-based compensation guidance, signaling a focus on balancing investment with revenue growth. Snap's executives noted potential constraints on advertising demand as the primary reason for withholding guidance, mirroring concerns expressed by other tech companies facing a turbulent economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Bret Stephens of The New York Times interviews Dane Chapin, a San Diego-area entrepreneur and owner of USAopoly (The Op), about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on his business. Chapin, who voted for Trump in the last election, expresses concern that the tariffs are forcing his company into survival mode, jeopardizing his 80 employees. He notes that most of his company's games are made in China due to a highly developed supply chain, and that domestic production would significantly increase prices. Chapin is critical of Trump's trade policy, especially the tariff exceptions made for large tech companies like Apple, while smaller businesses face significant challenges.</p>
