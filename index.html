          <p>Wildfire smoke from Canada is causing unhealthy air quality in the Great Lakes region and is expected to spread across the United States this weekend.

Residents are advised to take precautions to protect themselves from the harmful effects of the smoke, especially those with respiratory conditions. The severity of the air quality issue underscores the far-reaching consequences of these wildfires.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, is returning to the United States to face criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts related to a conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas across the country, potentially involving thousands of individuals, including some MS-13 gang members. Despite a 2019 court order preventing his deportation due to persecution fears, Abrego Garcia was initially sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. The Justice Department's prosecution is seen as an aggressive move following a judge's order to facilitate his return for due process.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the underlying philosophy driving President Trump's efforts to transform institutions, including government, universities, and corporations. The author argues that Trump's actions are rooted in anti-managerialism, a political ideology that views a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats as having usurped democracy. This perspective suggests that much of what is termed "populist" politics is actually an anti-managerial revolution seeking to curb bureaucratic control. Understanding this anti-managerialism is crucial for comprehending the Trump administration's institutional transformation efforts.</p>
