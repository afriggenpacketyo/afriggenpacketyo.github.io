          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he describes as "domestic terrorists" and protect federal facilities like the local ICE office. This move is framed as a response to ongoing protests and clashes, which Trump attributes to the "radical left." The announcement has drawn sharp criticism from Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor, as well as the state's Democratic senators, who have labeled the plan as authoritarian and an attempt to incite violence.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The enduring mystery has captivated the public for decades, spawning numerous theories about her fate. While the prevailing belief among experts is that Earhart and her navigator ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean, other theories suggest she was on a spy mission and captured by the Japanese. It remains unclear what classified information, if any, the government possesses on the matter.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. media reports, the FBI has fired a group of 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during racial justice protests in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The termination letters allegedly cited a "lack of judgement" in their actions. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the dismissals, arguing the agents' rights were violated. This move is seen by some as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to remove what it considers to be left-leaning influences from federal agencies.</p>

The match exposed significant defensive frailties in the Liverpool side, which has relied on late goals to secure victories this season. For Crystal Palace, the result is a testament to their strong form under manager Oliver Glasner.</p>

By publicly admitting to controversial moves, such as pressuring the Justice Department or leveraging his office for personal gain, he desensitizes the public and media, reducing the political fallout. This brazenness is perceived by his supporters as authenticity, effectively neutralizing what would have once been career-ending revelations and eroding traditional standards of accountability.</p>

          <p>This article explores the alarming rise of "nudify" websites that use generative AI to create nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfakes from publicly available photos. It follows a group of women in Minneapolis who discovered their images had been used, highlighting the significant psychological trauma and legal challenges victims face, as the mere creation of such content may not be illegal if it is not distributed. Their experience has spurred a legislative push in Minnesota to hold AI companies accountable for the misuse of their platforms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 100% tariff on all imported branded or patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1, 2025. The policy is designed to encourage domestic manufacturing, as it provides exemptions for generic drugs and for companies that are actively building or operating production facilities within the United States. This move is expected to cause significant disruption to global pharmaceutical supply chains, particularly for major exporters like the European Union, Ireland, and Germany.

This could create a difficult dilemma for the Fed: a scenario of strong GDP growth coexisting with rising unemployment, challenging its dual mandate of ensuring price stability and maximum employment.
