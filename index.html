          <p>At least 43 people, including 15 children, have died after catastrophic flash floods struck the Texas Hill Country, with dozens more remaining unaccounted for. The majority of the missing are children from Camp Mystic, a summer camp located along the Guadalupe River, which rose over 26 feet in less than an hour. A massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies is underway, with officials having rescued over 850 people, many by air. The disaster has prompted a federal disaster declaration to provide limitless state resources for the response.</p>

          <p>An unarmed North Korean man successfully crossed the heavily mined Demilitarized Zone and was taken into South Korean custody. The rare crossing occurred amid a shift in South Korea's policy toward Pyongyang, which has drawn criticism for potentially weakening deterrence. Military officials are investigating the man's motives, as this route is an increasingly uncommon choice for defectors, who typically travel through China. No unusual military movements were detected from the North following the incident.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani pitched two dominant, scoreless innings on his 31st birthday, continuing his promising return to the mound after surgery. However, the Dodgers' relief pitching could not maintain the momentum, as long man Justin Wrobleski gave up five runs in a 6-4 loss to the Houston Astros. The game highlighted the team's current reliance on a tenuous pitching depth while awaiting the return of other injured stars like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, who are progressing in their recovery.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's forthcoming biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the landscape of his youth. Traveling incognito, Samuel Clemens sought to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," reflecting on his cherished past as a steamboat pilot. The journey revealed both the profound changes to the river towns and his own deep, nostalgic connection to a time he considered one of true freedom, which would remain a touchstone throughout his life.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Communist Party has introduced new regulations for its central commissions and leading groups, which some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping is delegating more power to his deputies. The new rules are intended to standardize the policy coordination and review processes at the highest levels of government. According to state media, these top-level bodies are now directed to focus on major strategic planning, discussion, and oversight, potentially hinting at Xi's future succession plans.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email claiming President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the message as "blatant misinformation" and a partisan political statement. The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction for seniors, a nuance that was omitted from the agency's communication, causing confusion and accusations of politicization.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared in public for the first time since the 12-day conflict with Israel that began in June, according to Iranian state media.

          <p>A new study indicates that pregnant people exposed to high heat and wildfire smoke face increased risks of adverse birth outcomes, including having smaller babies. The research, focused on climate-vulnerable neighborhoods in Los Angeles, found the effects were more pronounced in the first trimester and even the month before conception. Health experts emphasize that pregnancy puts significant stress on the body, making it harder to dissipate heat, and are calling for greater awareness of these climate-related risks for expectant mothers.</p>
