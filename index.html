            <p>Apple shares experienced a 5% decline, partially offsetting the significant gains from the previous day, which marked Apple's best performance since 1998. The surge on Wednesday was fueled by President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on certain tariffs and a reduction of tariffs on most countries to 10%, intended to facilitate negotiations. This news triggered a broad market rally, particularly benefiting the Nasdaq Composite, but markets have since reversed course, impacting other tech giants like Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia. Apple's stock performance reflects the market's sensitivity to trade policy developments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Independent veterinary clinics like Vetique are emerging as alternatives to corporate-owned hospitals, focusing on personalized care and a calming environment.

They offer services such as acupuncture and herbal remedies, with transparent pricing models and payment plans to accommodate pet owners' financial constraints, while also addressing the mental health struggles of veterinarians.</p>

            <p>President Trump privately acknowledged that his tariff policies could potentially trigger a recession but was determined to prevent a depression, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal. Trump reportedly expressed willingness to accept "pain" associated with the policy, leading to a partial rollback of tariffs following market declines. The bond market's reaction, particularly a spike in Treasury yields, contributed to Trump's decision to ease tariffs, as investors grew concerned. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent played a key role in advising on trade policy, influencing Trump's shift in approach.</p>

            <p>The House adopted President Trump's budget blueprint following negotiations with Republican holdouts seeking deeper spending cuts. The resolution passed with a 216-214 vote, paving the way for implementing Trump's agenda, including border security, defense, energy priorities, and tax cuts. Securing the budget plan in both chambers is the initial step in the reconciliation process, enabling Congress to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold and pass measures with a simple majority. The compromise involves assurances from the Senate to pursue significant savings, although disagreements persist regarding the extent of spending cuts and accounting for tax cuts.</p>

            <p>Fintech companies like Affirm and Paypal experienced a pullback in stock prices after an initial rally sparked by a pause in tariffs, indicating continued market uncertainty. Despite the reprieve, the sector faces ongoing challenges, including rising hardware costs, small business credit exposure, and macroeconomic volatility. Analysts have varying outlooks, with some highlighting potential for outperformance due to company-specific strengths or shifts in credit conditions. The 90-day pause provides temporary relief but does not eliminate the underlying threat of tariffs, leaving fintechs vulnerable to margin pressure and geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Ryan Routh, previously charged federally with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, now faces additional state charges in Florida, including attempted first-degree murder and terrorism. The charges stem from an alleged plot to kill Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course in September. Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that the state was previously hindered by the Biden Justice Department but now has cooperation under the Trump administration. Routh is also accused of seeking military-grade weapons from a Ukrainian contact as part of the plot, and his trial is scheduled for September 2025.</p>

            <p>Attorneys for Mikal Mahdi, a South Carolina death row inmate, are fighting to stop his execution by firing squad, arguing he suffered prolonged childhood torture and did not receive a fair trial. Mahdi's lawyers argue his life should be spared due to profound abuse and his trial counsel's failure to present his childhood trauma to the court. South Carolina resumed executions last year, reviving the firing squad method, and Mahdi's lawyers contend his sentence is unjust given his history. Advocates are calling for clemency, while the state maintains Mahdi has exhausted his appeals.</p>

            <p>President Trump continues to entertain the possibility of seeking a third term in 2028, fueling speculation and debate within the Republican Party. Despite constitutional limitations, Trump's allies are exploring potential loopholes and avenues for him to remain in power. This includes amending the Constitution or running as a vice-presidential candidate with the intention of assuming the presidency later. The situation echoes Trump's refusal to concede the 2020 election, raising concerns about potential challenges to democratic norms and the Constitution.</p>

            <p>Wall Street experienced a decline, partially reversing the historic gains from the previous day following President Trump's pause on tariff hikes, with the exception of China. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all fell, reflecting continued market volatility due to trade war uncertainties. While the tariff pause initially boosted markets, the escalating trade battle between the U.S. and China remains a concern. Despite positive consumer inflation data, analysts remain cautious, citing the uncertain impact of tariffs on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.K. also experienced bond market volatility, with yields on 30-year bonds tumbling after an initial spike.

            <p>Inflation eased in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but economists warn that tariffs threaten to reverse this trend. The consumer price index rose 2.4% for the year, down from 2.8% in February, with core CPI also declining. However, rising grocery prices and the Trump administration's tariff policy pose challenges. Tariffs, a tax paid by U.S. importers, could lead to higher prices for consumers and push the inflation rate higher, potentially impacting the Federal Reserve's efforts to maintain price stability.

            <p>President Trump's trade war has injected significant uncertainty into the oil market, causing crude prices to fluctuate and undermining investor confidence, which jeopardizes domestic production. The rapid decline in prices, followed by a rebound after Trump's tariff pause, has created an environment of "extreme uncertainty" for U.S. oil producers. Lower prices and potential steel tariffs could force companies to reduce capital expenditures and scale back activity in the oil patch. Analysts have lowered price forecasts, warning that sustained low prices could lead to flatlined growth in U.S. onshore oil production. (not investment advice)</p>
