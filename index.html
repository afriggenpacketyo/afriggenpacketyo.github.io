          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to limit the ability of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision President Trump celebrated as a "monumental win." The ruling came in a case challenging Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the court did not address the order's constitutionality, leaving it for a future term. While the administration praised the curb on judicial power, which has frequently halted its policies, critics condemned the decision as a dangerous step toward authoritarianism. The ruling means legal challenges to the birthright citizenship order must now proceed on an individual or class-action basis.</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these changes will affect over 800,000 workers, with a significant portion being women and minority workers. The hikes come as the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009, prompting local governments to enact their own increases. The new hourly wages will be $13.00 in Alaska, $17.95 in Washington D.C., and $15.05 in Oregon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman now recommends that investors consider allocating 10% to 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous 1% suggestion. He attributes this shift to the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset class, citing the resolution of earlier uncertainties about government bans and institutional adoption. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating assets with higher growth potential. He believes crypto offers portfolio diversification and the potential for returns that are unlikely to be matched by other asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the signing of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, aiming to end a conflict that has lasted nearly three decades. The deal seeks to halt the violence in eastern DRC, where a militia allegedly supported by Rwanda has caused a severe humanitarian crisis. During the announcement, Trump stated the U.S. would enforce the agreement with significant pressure, including potential financial penalties, to ensure peace is maintained. The agreement also reportedly grants the United States access to the DRC's substantial mineral deposits, including gold, copper, and lithium.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man it wrongfully deported and later brought back to the U.S. on criminal charges, is facing significant challenges. A federal judge ordered Abrego Garcia's release pending trial, unconvinced by the government's evidence, which relies heavily on testimony from convicted felons who were offered deals to avoid deportation. In a complex legal maneuver, Abrego Garcia's lawyers have asked to delay his release, fearing ICE will immediately re-deport him to another country. The case has already led to the firing of one prosecutor who refused to support unsubstantiated claims against Abrego Garcia.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that approximately 56 million private-sector workers in the U.S., about half of the workforce, do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k). This lack of access creates a significant barrier to building wealth for retirement, as employees are 15 times more likely to save when contributions are automatically deducted from their paychecks. The research highlights a growing retirement crisis, with many workers forced to prioritize immediate expenses over long-term savings. This leaves millions potentially reliant solely on a Social Security system that faces its own long-term funding challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The move jeopardizes the trade relationship between the two close allies, which totaled roughly $762 billion last year.

In a case limiting nationwide injunctions, Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench, warning that "no right is safe" under the new precedent. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called the ruling an "existential threat to the rule of law," arguing it gifts the executive branch the power to disregard the law. These dissents underscore the sharp ideological divide on the court and the liberal wing's alarm over decisions they see as expanding executive power and undermining fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>The British government has softened its travel advice for Israel, now recommending against all but essential travel to most of the country following a recent ceasefire. This update comes as the final UK-organized evacuation flight for British nationals is scheduled to depart from Tel Aviv, with demand decreasing as commercial flights resume. The Foreign Office had previously advised against all travel to the region after missile exchanges began between Israel and Iran. While the situation is described as fragile, the eased guidance reflects the de-escalation of the 12-day conflict that ended with a U.S. and Qatar-brokered ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Irish singer CMAT, performing at the Glastonbury Festival, revealed that she continues to face online abuse after releasing a song that went viral on TikTok. The single, "Take A Sexy Picture Of Me," was written in response to being fat-shamed for her appearance at a festival last year. The 29-year-old artist, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, told BBC News that the negative comments are so persistent that she does not keep the TikTok app on her phone. She reflected on the sad reality that so many people relate to her song's themes about appearance-based criticism and the pressures faced by women.</p>

          <p>The new independent film "Ponyboi," written by and starring River Gallo, offers a rare cinematic portrayal of an intersex and Latine character. The movie, which premiered at Sundance, follows an intersex sex worker in New Jersey trying to escape a life of crime and violence. Gallo, who is intersex and the child of Salvadoran immigrants, developed the story from their own experiences and a desire to explore themes of masculinity and self-acceptance. The film is a significant milestone, being one of the first to center an intersex narrative and has been praised for bringing visibility to a community often ignored in media and legislation.</p>

Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, pointing to its strong financial connection with the recently listed and high-performing Circle Internet Group. Despite concerns about declining crypto trading volumes, the overall sentiment is bullish as institutional investors increasingly view crypto as an evolving asset class. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested on Friday that the early July deadline for reinstating widespread tariffs on numerous countries is not set in stone and could be extended. The statement provides a potential reprieve for U.S. trading partners who faced the prospect of massive tariffs snapping back into effect after a 90-day pause. The original executive order, which imposed duties as high as 50% on some nations, caused significant global economic turmoil before the temporary reduction. With the deadline approaching and only limited trade frameworks established with China and the U.K., the administration's next steps remain a source of uncertainty for global markets.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have elicited sharply divided reactions from foreign policy experts and former diplomats. Some, like former national security adviser John Bolton, support the action but believe it was terminated too soon, arguing that only regime change can bring regional stability. Others, including former Iranian officials and Middle East scholars, contend the strikes were counterproductive, violated international law, and undermined diplomacy. The analyses reveal deep fractures in the strategic community over how to address Iran's nuclear program, with opinions ranging from calls for more aggressive military action to urgent pleas for direct negotiations.</p>

          <p>In response to the growing practice of federal immigration agents wearing masks and plain clothes during enforcement actions, lawmakers are introducing legislation to ban the practice. An opinion article argues that this trend undermines law enforcement legitimacy, creates safety risks, and evokes images of authoritarian regimes rather than a democratic society. Proponents of the ban state that clear identification is essential for public accountability and transparency, and that masking makes it easier for criminals to impersonate officers. While ICE claims the policy protects agents, critics argue it erodes public trust and is counterproductive to safe and effective policing.</p>

The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that forcing participation in lessons that conflict with families' religious beliefs imposes an unconstitutional burden on their religious freedom. In a dissent read from the bench, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the ruling will create chaos for public schools and that mere exposure to different beliefs is not a constitutional violation.

In a classified briefing, Gen. Dan Caine explained that while other sites were hit with Massive Ordnance Penetrators, the Isfahan facility was only struck by Tomahawk missiles. This revelation helps explain why initial assessments suggested the U.S. strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, as a significant portion of its enriched uranium is stored at the heavily fortified Isfahan site.</p>
