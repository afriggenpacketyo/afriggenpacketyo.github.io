        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's State Department has released a significantly altered human rights report, drawing criticism for softening assessments of allies like El Salvador and Israel, while escalating condemnation of countries such as Brazil and South Africa. The revised document also notably omits previous mentions of LGBTQ+ rights and redefines reporting categories. This shift reflects the administration's "America First" foreign policy, which views traditional human rights promotion as interference. Critics, including former officials and rights groups, argue the report prioritizes political alignment, undermining its long-standing credibility as a global human rights reference and raising concerns about its selective focus.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO leaders are convening virtual meetings ahead of Trump's anticipated summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. European and Ukrainian officials are apprehensive about being excluded from the direct negotiations, fearing potential concessions that could favor Moscow. Trump has indicated a willingness to explore "land swaps" and has been dismissive of Zelenskyy's immediate inclusion, aiming to gauge Putin's sincerity in ending the four-year conflict. Zelenskyy, however, insists that "talks about us, without us, will not work," reaffirming Ukraine's refusal to surrender territory. The summit location is Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, chosen for security and availability.</p>

          <p>Four years following the collapse of Chinese property giant Evergrande, millions of homebuyers, including Rebecca Wei, are still grappling with the aftermath, residing in unfinished or substandard "broken houses." The US$300 billion debt crisis led to frozen construction projects across China, leaving many who prepaid for their homes facing severe financial losses. Developers often delivered properties that failed to meet basic inspection standards, lacking permanent utilities or fire safety compliance. This ongoing crisis underscores the profound and enduring impact on Chinese families, who are forced to live in barely habitable conditions due to developers cutting corners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report highlights the severe and often unaddressed health risks posed by climate change, especially for pregnant women and children globally. Extreme heat is linked to premature births, stillbirths, and infant mortality, while air pollution from fossil fuels and wildfires contributes to low birth weight and postpartum depression. One billion children are already at "extremely high risk" due to environmental shocks and poverty, with issues like increased flooding and drought exacerbating malnutrition and waterborne diseases. The article emphasizes that while these challenges will intensify with rising emissions, immediate interventions such as improved urban planning, public health data collection, and integrating maternal and child health into climate adaptation strategies can save lives.</p>

          <p>Paris has reopened the Seine River for public swimming, a historic first since the 1920s, fulfilling a long-standing promise to clean up the waterway. This achievement was facilitated by the construction of massive overflow tanks designed to contain sewage during heavy rains, a development spurred by the recent Olympic Games. Designated swimming areas, complete with docks, are now drawing both locals and tourists, providing a welcome respite during successive heat waves. The initiative revives a century-old tradition, allowing Parisians to cool off in their iconic river, reminiscent of scenes depicted in classic Impressionist paintings.</p>

This adjustment occurs amidst Russia's continued military advances in eastern Ukraine and its steadfast adherence to maximalist peace conditions, including retaining occupied territories. European and Ukrainian allies are apprehensive that Trump, who has floated ideas of "land swapping," might prioritize a swift peace deal at the expense of Ukraine's territorial integrity, a proposition vehemently rejected by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Analysts suggest the White House is scaling back expectations due to the inherent difficulty of achieving a mutually agreeable outcome.</p>

This encounter marks the first instance of a sitting Czech president meeting the Dalai Lama in India, escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations. China's firm stance underscores its sensitivity regarding the Dalai Lama and its territorial claims, leading to a significant downturn in bilateral relations.</p>

The 24-year-old, a former England U21 international, is scheduled to hold pivotal discussions with Aston Villa within the next 24 hours to determine his future. Should the clubs finalize a deal and Ramsey decide to depart, he is expected to enter into talks with Newcastle regarding personal terms, as St James' Park is understood to be his preferred destination over other interested clubs like West Ham. Ramsey has scored 17 goals in 167 appearances for Villa since his 2019 senior debut.</p>

          <p>France, the UK, and Germany have officially notified the United Nations of their intent to trigger "snapback sanctions" on Iran if Tehran does not resume dialogue on its nuclear program by August 2025. This ultimatum comes amidst heightened regional tensions, exacerbated by recent Israeli and US bombings of Iranian nuclear facilities. The "snapback" mechanism, embedded in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), allows for the automatic re-imposition of UN sanctions if Iran significantly violates the agreement. Iran's uranium enrichment has reached 60% purity, significantly above the JCPOA limit, prompting international warnings despite Tehran's insistence that its program is for civilian energy purposes only.</p>

They argue these findings contradict the drug's "safe" and "effective" marketing message.

Although temperatures remain within recommended guidelines, critics argue this deters some individuals, like Tiffany Watson who has muscular dystrophy, from using pools for health benefits. The Local Government Association emphasizes the "fragile position" of council finances, noting that nearly a quarter of English councils are reducing or closing leisure services, highlighting the broader impact of rising operational costs on public amenities.</p>

          <p>Gaza City is enduring intense air attacks as Israeli forces prepare for a takeover operation, leading to reports of "massive destruction" and challenges in recovering dead and injured civilians. Concurrently, the UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan issued a joint statement warning that "famine is unfolding in front of our eyes" in Gaza, urging immediate action to increase aid flow and cease lethal force near distribution points. The World Health Organization has also appealed to Israel to allow medical supply stocking before the anticipated military operation. Israel denies the famine claims, accusing UN agencies of failing to distribute available aid, as international pressure mounts over the 22-month-long conflict.</p>

          <p>This article from CNBC's UK Exchange newsletter critically examines London's evolving financial future, questioning its status as a leading global hub amid significant economic headwinds. The author details soaring living costs, the persistent economic drag of Brexit on trade and productivity, and a dramatic fall in IPO fundraising, signaling a diminished appeal for the UK's equity markets. Despite these challenges, the article points to recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of England and potential new trade agreements as sources of optimism.

          <p>UK newspaper headlines are currently dominated by reports of a significant surge in migrant arrivals, with over 50,000 people reaching the UK on small boats since the current prime minister assumed office, a pace described as "record speed." This development has ignited political blame games, with a former Labour home secretary attributing the high figures to the previous Conservative government. Separately, reports suggest the Treasury is exploring tighter inheritance tax rules to increase revenue, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from the shadow chancellor. Additionally, the revelation that a record eight million people are now receiving universal credit raises broader concerns about Britain's fiscal health and the sustainability of its welfare system.</p>

Despite Shohei Ohtani's dramatic go-ahead home run in the top of the ninth inning, the Dodgers' bullpen faltered, allowing the Angels to equalize in the ninth and secure the win in the tenth. This latest setback highlights a profound midseason collapse, as their once substantial nine-game division lead has evaporated in just over a month.

          <p>California is challenging the Trump administration in court over its deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, asserting the move was an illegal "power grab" that violated the Posse Comitatus Act and instilled "anxiety and fear" among residents. The state argues troops performed domestic law enforcement duties beyond protecting federal property. Conversely, the Justice Department defends the deployment as legal, intended to safeguard federal personnel, and within the president's authority under Title 10, citing the protests as a form of "rebellion." This lawsuit underscores a significant legal and constitutional debate regarding the extent of presidential power and military involvement in civilian matters, with the judge questioning the administration's interpretation of "rebellion."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that President Trump's potential acceptance of Vladimir Putin's narratives presents a more significant threat to Ukraine than direct military actions. The author argues that both leaders are incentivized to frame a decisive end to the war, potentially without Ukrainian involvement, driven by Trump's personal ambition and Putin's unfulfilled territorial objectives. European allies fear Trump might outline an unjust ceasefire proposal that Ukraine cannot accept, allowing Putin to shift blame for prolonged conflict. The article concludes that Trump's transactional approach, valuing deals that benefit him personally over strategic or moral considerations, makes him vulnerable to manipulation, which could ultimately undermine Ukraine's independence.</p>

The NCMD asserts these fatalities are "entirely preventable," advocating for landlords to prioritize fixing faulty windows and ensuring proper locks or restrictors are in place. This concern is echoed by a housing watchdog's report, which likens the prevalence of window safety defects in social housing to known issues with damp and mould. Families living in such conditions express fear, while medical professionals report a concerning rise in severe injuries from these falls.</p>

Given that the US is Switzerland's most significant export destination, these tariffs are expected to "annihilate" sales, prompting the Swiss government to implement a furlough program to mitigate potential mass layoffs. The author argues that Switzerland's traditional neutrality and non-alignment with the EU or NATO, once perceived as advantageous, are now proving to be liabilities in a new era of aggressive geoeconomics. This unexpected economic shock has triggered a profound national identity crisis, challenging the long-standing narrative of Swiss exceptionalism and necessitating a reevaluation of its global position.
