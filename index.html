          <h2>FBI Issues Warning About "Time-Traveling" Hackers Bypassing Security Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 10:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI has alerted the public to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures, effectively making expired security certificates valid again. This method, notably used in Medusa ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure, involves altering the system date to a time when certificates were still valid, allowing malicious software to be recognized as legitimate. The FBI recommends using strong antivirus software, enabling two-factor authentication, using strong and unique passwords, monitoring for suspicious system time changes, and keeping systems updated to stay safe from Medusa malware. This attack highlights how cybercriminals are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function, challenging traditional security approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba have reportedly purchased Nvidia GPUs, primarily H20 chips, from ByteDance to support their AI development, including Tencent's ChatGPT-like application Yuanbao. ByteDance, which had stockpiled a significant amount of chips, makes a portion of its computing power available for sale through its cloud computing unit. This comes amid surging demand for computing power driven by AI adoption and tighter U.S. export restrictions, which have made access to advanced semiconductor technologies more difficult for Chinese companies. Nvidia now requires approval to export H20 GPUs to China.</p>

          <p>Congress is back from recess, with Republicans aiming to advance President Trump's agenda, focusing on extending the 2017 tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling. Committees will begin drafting legislation to reconcile spending with new budget goals, with a May 9 deadline. Democrats are rallying against the GOP budget plan, warning of cuts to Medicaid and other programs. The budget reconciliation process allows Republicans to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate, but disagreements over spending cuts could stall progress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The push to broaden access to private equity for retail investors raises concerns about their preparedness to handle the complexities and risks involved. While private equity offers diversification and potentially higher returns, retail investors may be targeted to fill capacity, receiving less desirable opportunities compared to institutional players. The lack of transparency and illiquidity in private equity markets can leave retail investors vulnerable, and the fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to poor decision-making. Retail investors should proceed with caution and fully understand the risks before investing in private equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll assesses President Trump's first 100 days, revealing continued support from a loyal base but growing concerns about tariffs and rising prices. While MAGA Republicans have a positive outlook on the economy, others are less approving of Trump's handling of the economy and inflation. The poll indicates that Trump's policies are making some Americans financially worse off, leading to declining approval ratings on the economy and inflation. Immigration remains a key issue, with most Americans approving of Trump's deportation program.</p>

          <p>In northeastern Syria, an autonomous region run by the country’s Kurdish minority, suspicion of the new leadership runs deep. While the new Syrian government, formed by former rebel forces, is working to unite disparate armed groups, Kurdish distrust stems from the fact that some leaders were once affiliated with Al Qaeda. Additionally, the new government's backing by Turkey, which has historically opposed Kurdish power, fuels this wariness.</p>

The American poultry industry is adapting to the demand for dark meat by increasing the production of deboned thighs.
