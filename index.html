          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing across Scotland following Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. The storm caused widespread power outages, affecting approximately 50,000 homes, and led to significant travel disruptions, including numerous train and flight cancellations. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) and Network Rail are working to restore services and clear debris, with thousands of homes still awaiting reconnection. The Scottish government has held emergency meetings, advising caution as the clear-up continues, though the weather forecast is expected to improve.</p>

          <p>Students across Scotland are receiving their exam results, but the aftermath of Storm Floris is causing delivery delays for physical certificates in island regions like the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. While electronic results via email and text are unaffected, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has advised students in affected areas to contact their schools for their marks. The storm's impact on travel and postal services prompted this disruption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, alleging he violated previous precautionary measures related to his ongoing trial. He is accused of masterminding a coup plot to remain in power after his 2022 election defeat. The decision, made by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, was prompted by Bolsonaro addressing supporters via his son's phone, which was deemed a breach of his restrictions. The case is amplified by international tensions, as the Trump administration has linked trade tariffs to the trial's outcome and condemned the house arrest order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 after a strong pitching performance from starter Tyler Glasnow went to waste. Glasnow pitched seven innings, allowing only one run, but the bullpen couldn't maintain the lead, surrendering crucial runs in the eighth and ninth innings. A two-out single by the Cardinals' Yohel Pozo in the top of the ninth inning drove in the decisive run. Despite a solo home run from Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers' offense struggled to capitalize, ultimately falling short in the closely contested game.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is launching a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country. This policy targets visitors from nations with high rates of visa overstays or those with citizenship-by-investment programs. The State Department aims to test the feasibility of the bond system and determine if it encourages compliance with visa terms. The bond amount will be determined by consular officers based on the traveler's circumstances, and the program is also seen as a diplomatic tool to pressure foreign governments.</p>

Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic "pogrom" that led to the mass exodus and killing of ethnic Serbs, commemorating the anniversary with solemn remembrance ceremonies. The 1995 operation decisively shifted the military balance in the region, leading to the Dayton Peace Agreement but also leaving a legacy of unresolved war crimes and ethnic displacement.</p>

          <p>British newspaper headlines are focusing on a growing controversy involving Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who accused police of a "cover-up" regarding the immigration status of men in a child sexual assault case. The issue has created a rift between the government and police, with calls for greater transparency. Other major stories include the BBC's former "Repair Shop" presenter Jay Blades being charged with sexual assault, and a warning from London's Metropolitan police about potential mass detentions at a planned pro-Palestine rally. Additionally, reports indicate many wealthy parents prepaid private school fees to avoid a new tax.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting in Geneva to resume negotiations for a legally binding global treaty to address the plastic pollution crisis. After two years of talks, no agreement has been reached, with major sticking points including whether to cap plastic production or focus solely on recycling and waste management. Scientists estimate nearly 200 trillion pieces of plastic are in the world's oceans, posing a severe threat to wildlife and human health. While a coalition of nearly 100 countries supports production limits, oil-producing nations have resisted, creating a difficult path toward a comprehensive deal.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that less than two years after ousting the populist Law and Justice party, Poland's democratic coalition, led by Donald Tusk, is losing public support. The initial euphoria has faded amid public frustration, and Tusk's government is criticized for failing to deliver on key promises like liberalizing abortion laws and for adopting nationalist rhetoric on migration. This failure to present a compelling, forward-looking vision has allowed right-wing populists to regain momentum. The article posits this as a cautionary tale for other democracies, showing that simply defeating populists is not enough without a proactive agenda.</p>

          <p>Recent social media footage has provided a glimpse of what is believed to be China's next-generation airborne early warning and control aircraft, the KJ-3000. The prototype appears to be based on a modified Y-20B transport plane, distinguished by a large, saucer-shaped rotodome on its fuselage which houses advanced radar equipment. While some Western militaries have moved away from this type of aircraft for modern warfare, Beijing seems committed to the technology. The development of the KJ-3000 indicates China's continued focus on enhancing its long-range surveillance and command capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Nationwide Shortage of Volunteer Firefighters Threatens to Strain Local Budgets</h2>

          <p>Communities across the U.S. are facing a critical shortage of volunteer firefighters, a trend that could force more towns to switch to paid departments and increase taxpayer costs. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's firefighters and save an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers have declined over 20% since 1985 while emergency call volumes have tripled. This burnout is straining the system that many smaller communities rely on. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment and prevent the collapse of this essential civil service.</p>

          <p>Saquon Barkley, star running back for the Philadelphia Eagles, has declined an invitation to serve on President Donald Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position. The council, being re-established by executive order, includes other prominent sports figures like golfer Bryson DeChambeau and WWE executive Paul Levesque. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, said he respects the office but was surprised his name was mentioned for the role.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave system near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The find was part of a broader survey that also uncovered evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The discoveries, made in partnership with local cave explorers, provide new insights into how prehistoric people lived and farmed in the region. The project is part of a larger initiative aimed at preserving the history and traditional land use of England's upland commons.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged more than 20% after President Trump praised the company's controversial ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the ad the "HOTTEST" out there and encouraged his followers to buy the jeans. The campaign had previously drawn criticism from some who accused its "great genes/jeans" wordplay of having eugenicist undertones. Trump's endorsement, however, turned the controversy into a significant financial gain for the retailer, which had been facing difficult market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's critical energy supplies would be exhausted quickly in the event of a military blockade by China. War-gaming scenarios showed that natural gas supplies would last only 11 days, coal reserves seven weeks, and oil about 20 weeks. However, the report also argues that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing. The analysis suggests such an action would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider, more devastating conflict involving the United States and other regional powers.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program are currently unclaimed, according to a new report. The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace the winners, particularly for older accounts or those gifted to children who may be unaware they exist. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of winners, solicitors and consumer groups are calling for reforms to make the tracing process less bureaucratic, especially during a cost-of-living crisis.

          <p>An advertising campaign for American Eagle featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has sparked a significant social media debate and drawn comment from President Trump. The controversy centers on an ad where Sweeney's "great jeans" is a pun on her "great genes," which some critics linked to eugenics rhetoric. The company defended the campaign as being solely about denim, but the debate intensified after reports that Sweeney is a registered Republican. Trump then praised the actress and the ad, contrasting it with what he called "woke" advertising and contributing to a surge in the company's stock price.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in California are issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have been exposed to a blue-dyed rodenticide, causing their fat and muscle tissue to turn blue. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) confirmed the presence of the anticoagulant poison diphacinone in a tested sample. The department is urging pesticide applicators to use bait stations inaccessible to non-target wildlife. They are also warning hunters to avoid consuming any game animal that shows blue discoloration or other abnormalities, as the meat could be contaminated.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This trend is directly linked to a sharp rise in screening rates for this age group after the recommended starting age was lowered to 45. The findings are considered promising news, as earlier detection improves treatment outcomes. However, researchers caution that screening rates in this demographic remain suboptimal and that disparities exist based on insurance status and education level, indicating more work is needed to ensure equitable access to this preventative care.</p>

They reject accusations of abandoning their duties, arguing they are using a constitutionally protected tactic to prevent harmful legislation.

          <p>A group of more than a dozen progressive Democrats in the U.S. House, led by Congressman Ro Khanna, are urging the Trump administration to officially recognize a Palestinian state. In a draft letter, they argue that the current tragic moment highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and rights. The letter adds that a viable Palestinian state would need to recognize Israel and guarantee its security. This move comes as several key U.S. allies have also pledged to recognize Palestinian statehood, though the Trump administration has stated it views such a move as "rewarding Hamas."</p>

          <p>Firefighters on Maui successfully battled a brush fire that broke out near Ka'anapali, a few miles north of the site of the devastating 2023 Lahaina wildfires. The fire, located near the old Sugar Cane Train warehouse, prompted the closure of a section of the Honoapiʻilani Highway due to smoke and firefighting efforts. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the blaze was slowly being contained. The incident raised concerns in a community still recovering from one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history, which occurred nearly two years ago.</p>
