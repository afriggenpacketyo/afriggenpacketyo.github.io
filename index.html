          <p>For the first time in five years, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic expedition to study the evolution of oceans and the forces behind climate change. A total of 25 members from both countries will spend 45 days aboard a research ship in the Bering Sea and northwestern Pacific. This ninth joint expedition focuses on the effects of a changing climate on deep-sea environments and signals renewed scientific cooperation. The mission is also seen by some as strengthening their strategic partnership, particularly concerning ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay $200 million to the federal government and $21 million to the EEOC to resolve investigations into alleged antisemitism and discrimination on its campus. In exchange, the government will restore hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen research grants. The agreement, which Columbia's leadership states will safeguard its academic independence, also codifies recent campus policy changes. The Trump administration praised the deal as a potential roadmap for other universities facing similar scrutiny over campus culture and student conduct.</p>

          <p>Thai and Cambodian troops have clashed near the disputed Ta Muen Thom temple area, with both nations accusing the other of initiating the hostilities. The exchange of fire resulted in at least two Thai soldiers being injured and followed weeks of escalating tensions, including a recent landmine incident. This confrontation marks a significant deterioration in bilateral relations, prompting both countries to reinforce their military presence along the contested border. The situation remains delicate as leaders from both sides address the armed aggression.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision, declaring the executive order to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional. The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocks the administration's attempt to deny citizenship to many individuals born on U.S. soil. This legal battle challenges a core principle of the 14th Amendment, which was established in 1868 and grants citizenship to nearly everyone born in the country. The case is now positioned to potentially advance to the Supreme Court for a final determination.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump will visit the Federal Reserve, a highly unusual move for a sitting U.S. president. This action is widely interpreted as an escalation of his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he has repeatedly criticized for not lowering interest rates. The visit directly challenges the long-standing tradition of respecting the central bank's political independence from the executive branch. It marks a remarkable symbolic gesture aimed at influencing the nation's monetary policy.</p>

Researchers suggest that this more realistic and achievable target could encourage more people to engage in daily physical activity for tangible and substantial health benefits.</p>

This appeal overturns a previous ruling that the state-owned airline was protected from such lawsuits under international travel laws.

          <p>A San Francisco high school religion and Spanish teacher is recovering and heading home after being brutally attacked and stabbed in the neck at a Milan train station. The 29-year-old teacher was on vacation when he was assaulted by a group of men who stole his belongings, including his passport, and left him bleeding on the platform. Italian authorities have since arrested four suspects in connection with the attack, which police reportedly said was one of several similar robberies carried out by the same group.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, establishing a 19% tariff on imports from the two nations while securing duty-free access for American exports. Analysts suggest the move is an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and gaining access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already a step ahead, having localized much of their production within Southeast Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

The blaze quickly expanded to 120 acres, jumping the freeway and forcing its temporary closure in both directions as crews responded with ground and air support. By evening, firefighters had successfully stopped the fire's forward rate of spread and established a dozer line around its perimeter.

An increase in the number of homes for sale is giving buyers more options and slightly increasing the time houses sit on the market. However, median sale prices hit a new record high in June, driven by tight inventory from homeowners locked into low mortgage rates. This continues to make affordability a major challenge for many prospective purchasers. (not investment advice)</p>
