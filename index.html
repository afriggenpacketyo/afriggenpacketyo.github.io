          <p>This New York Times guest essay explores the intellectual underpinnings of President Trump's expansive view of executive power. It argues that Trump's actions go beyond the unitary executive theory and draw from a longer tradition of right-wing thought, including figures like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule, who favor strong executive rule. The author warns that such a broad view of executive power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers.</p>
