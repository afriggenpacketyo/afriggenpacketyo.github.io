          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being targeted by a shooter while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office reported that first responders were under active sniper fire from what appeared to be high-powered rifles, creating a highly dangerous and ongoing situation. Law enforcement, with FBI support, is engaged in a major operation to locate and neutralize the suspect, but efforts are complicated by smoke and the presence of civilians on the mountain. The active threat has prompted shelter-in-place orders for local residents as the situation continues to develop.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.7 in June, marking the third straight month of contraction and signaling persistent economic weakness. The data reflects ongoing struggles for manufacturers, who are dealing with sluggish consumer demand, a deepening price war, and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on exports. Despite these challenges, the non-manufacturing sector showed slight growth, and Beijing has indicated it will step up efforts to boost domestic consumption. The continued manufacturing slump and deflationary pressures are fueling expectations for more government stimulus to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures in central and eastern England predicted to reach 34Â°C (93Â°F), potentially making it one of the hottest June days on record. An amber heat-health alert is active for five regions, signaling likely impacts on the health service and travel disruptions, while the London Fire Brigade has warned of a "severe" wildfire risk. The UK Health Security Agency has advised the public to take precautions, as the high temperatures are expected to increase mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun debating a massive spending and tax bill, facing significant internal Republican opposition and a critical report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Senator Thom Tillis condemned the legislation for breaking promises on Medicaid funding, while the CBO estimated it would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt and potentially leave nearly 12 million more people uninsured. Despite President Trump urging his party to pass the bill before a July 4th deadline, its final passage remains uncertain due to the shaky support and concerns over its fiscal and social impacts. The debate is proceeding toward a series of amendment votes.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" but did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. This assessment contrasts with claims from U.S. officials that the program was "obliterated," and aligns more closely with initial intelligence reports suggesting a setback of only a few months. Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological knowledge to rebuild its program and stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites. He warned that without verification, it's impossible to confirm the status and location of Iran's enriched uranium.</p>

          <p>The UK's public inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic is now examining the devastating impact on the social care sector, a phase long-awaited by bereaved families. This module will investigate key government decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes in early 2020 without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus and leading to thousands of deaths. The inquiry will also scrutinize issues like the use of "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies that isolated residents. Care home staff and families are seeking accountability for what they describe as one of the most significant failures of the pandemic response.</p>

Guardiola's comments echo similar sentiments from other top managers like JÃ¼rgen Klopp, who have criticized the relentless schedule. Despite the concerns, Guardiola stated his team will follow the rules set by football's governing bodies and focus on competing to win the tournament while managing player recovery.</p>

Authorities cited concerns that the event would undermine "social peace, family structure, and moral values." Despite the heavy police presence designed to prevent large gatherings, activists clashed with officers while carrying rainbow flags. The crackdown occurs amid increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, which human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile environment and leading to increased discrimination and violence in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary opponent against him. The threat was a direct response to Tillis's refusal to support a massive spending and tax bill central to Trump's agenda, with the senator citing its "devastating" cuts to Medicaid in his state. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, noting that leaders who demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an "endangered species." His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a historically Republican state.</p>

Kitagawa was indicted and initially admitted to the charge but later claimed the encounter was consensual. Hikari's case highlights the challenges faced by victims of sexual assault in Japan's hierarchical society and has drawn comparisons to other high-profile MeToo cases in the country, sparking a broader conversation about justice and accountability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is increasing its efforts to combat a rising wave of attacks against religious institutions, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon described the attacks as a form of terrorism intended to make people of faith feel unsafe. The department has recently secured lengthy prison sentences in cases involving planned attacks on churches and is prioritizing hate crime investigations. The surge in threats is partly attributed to emerging white nationalism and the targeting of minority groups or houses of worship that are welcoming to LGBTQ+ communities.</p>

          <p>The search for the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, a marsupial predator declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. Enthusiasts use trail cameras and forensic techniques to find evidence, driven by a deep-seated hope that the creature still roams the island's dense outback. In a separate scientific effort, a de-extinction project backed by $15 million in funding is working to resurrect the thylacine. Researchers at the University of Melbourne aim to edit the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart, to recreate the extinct animal's genome, though some scientists remain skeptical of the project's feasibility.</p>

LISAs, designed for first-time home buyers or retirement savings, offer a 25% government bonus on contributions but impose a significant penalty for early withdrawals not used for a qualifying purpose. This penalty effectively results in a 6.25% loss of the saver's own capital. The Treasury Committee's report also highlighted the product's complexity and its "nonsensical" rules that can negatively affect eligibility for state benefits, suggesting it may have been mis-sold to some individuals.

Allegations include the use of substandard parts and improper assembly processes, which they claimed could lead to catastrophic failure.

The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning, forecasting that the system will bring heavy rainfall of three to six inches, with isolated totals up to 10 inches, across several Mexican states. This rainfall poses a significant threat of dangerous flooding and mudslides as the storm moves inland overnight Sunday or early Monday, even as it is expected to weaken upon landfall.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned comments made by the punk duo Bob Vylan during their Glastonbury Festival performance as "appalling hate speech." The group's frontman led chants calling for "death to the IDF," prompting criticism from the government and festival organizers, who said the statements "very much crossed a line." The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and announced the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service. The incident has sparked a political firestorm, with calls for the band to be prosecuted for inciting violence and hatred.</p>

          <h2>Vin Diesel Suggests Paul Walker's Character Could Return for 'Fast & Furious' Finale</h2>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise could feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel stated that bringing back the beloved character was one of his conditions for agreeing to a 2027 release date for the finale. Walker passed away in 2013 during the filming of "Furious 7," and his role was completed using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. The potential return of his character raises questions about the use of digital recreation for deceased actors, a practice that remains a topic of debate.</p>

          <h2>Residents of Occupied Mariupol Describe Grim Reality Contradicting Russian Propaganda</h2>

          <p>Ukrainians living in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol are refuting the sanitized image presented by pro-Russia media, describing a city still in ruins with severe shortages. Three years after a brutal siege, residents report that reconstruction is largely superficial, limited to main streets for propaganda purposes, while many live in half-destroyed buildings. They face critical water and power shortages, scarce and expensive food and medicine, and the imposition of a Russian curriculum in schools that teaches a distorted version of history. Despite the risks, a local resistance movement continues to gather intelligence and display symbols of Ukrainian identity.</p>
