          <p>More travelers are utilizing 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services to finance their trips, citing quick approvals and manageable installments as key benefits. BNPL companies like Klarna and Affirm have reported significant increases in travel bookings and volume. However, financial experts caution against the risks of accumulating debt and missed payments, emphasizing the importance of responsible usage and awareness of potential fees.

While this marks a slight uptick after a long-term decline, demographers caution against drawing definitive conclusions due to ongoing economic uncertainties and challenges faced by families. The report also reveals a record-low number of teenage births and an increase in births among women aged 40-44, with Hispanic and Asian women contributing to the rise. The report does not address abortion bans, but research suggests increased birth rates and infant mortality in states with bans.</p>

          <p>Police chiefs in the UK will be granted new powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks, aiming to boost public confidence in policing. The reforms, prompted by an independent report into the Sarah Everard murder, make passing vetting checks a legal requirement for all officers. The new measures address concerns about officers who fail vetting checks remaining in their roles on full pay. The Home Secretary emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards within the police force.</p>
