          <p>President Trump's attendance at the Kennedy Center's 'Les MisÃ©rables' opening night was met with both cheers and boos, highlighting the divided political climate. The event marked Trump's first visit since becoming chairman after restructuring the board and replacing the president of the organization. Some attendees dressed in drag, a symbolic act considering Trump's previous statements against drag shows. Trump dismissed concerns about actors opting out of performing due to his presence, stating his focus is on running the country. The evening included a fundraising event where supporters paid nearly $2 million to attend the opening night with the president. The optimism score of this article reflects a divided sentiment due to the mixed reactions.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 meticulously recorded the appearance of a new star, later identified as a nova, near the Milky Way. The record describes the star's size, color, and brightness, noting it remained stationary for ten days. This rediscovered account confirms the event as a nova, resolving a debate among modern astronomers. The detailed observations allowed researchers to narrow down the star's possible location.

          <p>The United States is conducting a review of the AUKUS submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with its 'America First' agenda. This review comes amid pressure on Australia to increase its military spending. While Australia and the UK downplay the review, seeing it as a natural reassessment by a new administration, concerns linger about the US's capacity to meet its own submarine demands. Experts suggest the review could lead to a shift in focus away from submarines, while China has criticized the deal.</p>

The new regulations provide a friendlier regulatory environment compared to Singapore and other regions. By embracing stablecoins, Hong Kong hopes to leverage its offshore yuan holdings and China's cryptocurrency restrictions to gain a competitive edge in the digital asset market.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that is considered the closest known ancestor of tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. The discovery, based on two 86-million-year-old skeletons, provides insights into the evolution of tyrannosaurs from smaller hunters to formidable giants. The new species exhibits early stages of features crucial to tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as a strong jaw. This finding has prompted a revision of the tyrannosaur family tree.</p>

The state is providing some assistance, including wolf-tracking maps and compensation for confirmed kills, but funding for deterrents has been exhausted.
