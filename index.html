          <p>Former President Donald Trump amplified a conspiracy theory on social media, reposting a false claim that President Joe Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone. This is not the first time Trump has promoted outlandish theories, and it reflects a pattern of disseminating misinformation to his followers. The original post originated from another user and quickly gained traction within certain online communities. The spread of such claims underscores the ongoing challenges of combating disinformation in the digital age, particularly within the political sphere. The impact of these theories on public perception and trust in institutions remains a concern. </p>

          <p>Six people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, after a suspect allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails at a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling "free Palestine" during the attack, which the FBI is investigating as a targeted act of terrorism. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were taken to local hospitals, with one in critical condition. The attack occurred during a weekly silent march held since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. The incident has prompted responses from law enforcement and government officials, who condemned the violence and pledged support for the investigation.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, emphasizes the importance of global scientific collaboration despite geopolitical tensions between the US and China. He believes that breakthroughs in human biology, math, physics, and chemistry are universally applicable, regardless of their origin. Diamandis expresses concern over cuts to scientific funding in the US, particularly at the National Institutes of Health, which he believes could hinder the pace of scientific discoveries. He remains optimistic about the potential of AI and biotechnology to address global challenges and improve humanity.</p>

          <h2>Universities Cut Courses, Raising Concerns About Subject 'Cold Spots'</h2>

          <p>A review by Universities UK indicates that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses. Some universities are already delivering courses in collaboration to benefit students, but reluctance to collaborate due to concerns around breaking business laws is hindering efforts. Greater collaboration could be a solution for institutions struggling to cut costs and become more efficient, according to the report. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has expressed support for collaboration where possible in a "very challenging" financial situation for the sector.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs due to widespread displacement of families. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, the highest number on record. The government says it is investing ¬£1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

Odyssey Sims led the Sparks with 32 points, but it was not enough to secure the win. The Sparks will now play eight of their next 11 games on the road.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing scrutiny over a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, but has drawn criticism from the U.S. and local political groups. Legal experts say it would apply in rare circumstances, such as when land is needed for the "public interest" or is being held for speculative purposes. The government hopes the law will make it easier to acquire land and settle outstanding land claims, though some doubt it will be implemented soon due to the political cost.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This decision came shortly after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article co-authored by VA pulmonologists warning that cancelled contracts, layoffs, and staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. Veterans advocates have criticized the move as censorship by the Trump administration. The article raised concerns about the impact of budget cuts on the quality of care for veterans.</p>

The community of Lockerbie's response to the disaster has become a symbol of kindness. In 2001, Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi was convicted of the bombing, and in 2022, Abu Agila Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi was taken into American custody and accused of building the bomb.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is fighting to correct what he believes was a "robbery" of his military pension. Williams says that due to a change in military pension rules, he was given a discharge date in 1970, while others who applied for redundancy at the same time were given a discharge date in 1972, resulting in a much better pension. Despite numerous appeals to official bodies, Williams has been told that his pension reflected his "full and correct entitlement." He hopes that by speaking out publicly, he can bring more attention to his case and find other veterans affected by the same issue.</p>
