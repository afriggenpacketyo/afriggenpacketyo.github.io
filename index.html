          <p>Undisputed heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk has announced his intention to continue fighting for two more years, planning a return to the ring in 2026. The 38-year-old Ukrainian previously hinted at retirement but has reversed that decision, aiming to fight until he is 41 before building a sports academy. Usyk, who is recovering from a back injury, confirmed he would not face British heavyweight Moses Itauma, citing the younger fighter's age and past comments.

          <p>Cédric Jubillar, a 38-year-old painter-decorator, has been convicted of murdering his wife, Delphine, in a high-profile French trial where her body was never found. Sentenced to 30 years, Jubillar maintained his innocence throughout the four-week hearing in Albi. Prosecutors presented extensive circumstantial evidence, including a strained marriage, Delphine's new affair, a neighbor hearing screams, and inconsistencies in Jubillar's account. Despite the defense arguing a lack of a body meant no certain crime, the jury's "intimate conviction" led to the guilty verdict, a rare outcome in such cases.</p>

          <p>A Michigan Democratic "unity" dinner sparked controversy due to a sign displaying "MAGA=NAZI" and "86 47," which critics interpret as a coded threat against former President Trump. The sign, featured in a photo with local Democratic leaders, drew significant online backlash for its divisive and potentially violent implications. A spokesman for one of the headlining candidates, Mallory McMorrow, acknowledged the sign was "wrong" and urged careful word choice. This incident highlights heightened political tensions and concerns about rhetoric ahead of the upcoming election, especially following recent acts of political violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is intensifying efforts to end the war in Ukraine, announcing an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. This diplomatic push follows a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, allowing renewed focus on Ukraine. Trump indicated he might use the prospect of supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles as leverage during discussions with Putin, a move Russia has deemed a "serious escalation." The U.S. President is also scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss further military support, signaling a significant shift in the administration's approach to the conflict.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Adviser to Donald Trump, has surrendered to authorities in Maryland to face 18 charges related to the unlawful transmission and retention of classified documents, some top secret. Prosecutors allege Bolton shared "diary-like entries" with relatives and used personal email accounts, which were later compromised by a cyber actor linked to Iran. Bolton's attorney stated the documents were unclassified and known to the FBI since 2021, calling the charges politically motivated. This indictment makes Bolton the third Trump opponent to face criminal charges recently, escalating concerns about the weaponization of the Justice Department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve implementing interest rate cuts, homeowners are advised to reconsider home equity loans over credit cards for significant financing needs. Home equity loan rates, currently around 8.15-8.30%, are nearly three times cheaper than credit card rates, which hover around 22%. Unlike variable credit card rates, home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing budgeting predictability and greater potential for future rate drops. This article explains that home equity loans will respond more positively to Fed actions, potentially offering substantial savings through refinancing. Additionally, record-high home equity levels mean borrowers often have more funds available through these loans compared to credit card limits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are severely impacting small businesses, forcing them to take on high-interest loans, raise prices, and consider layoffs, according to a CNBC report. Businesses like AV Universal Corp. and Talus Products are struggling with dramatically increased duty bills, leading to reduced inventory and declining sales. Economists warn that these struggles among small businesses, which are crucial to the U.S. economy, could be a "canary in the coal mine" for broader economic challenges in 2026. The fate of many tariffs remains uncertain as the Supreme Court reviews their legality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that tens of thousands of federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will receive pay during the ongoing government shutdown. This decision ensures continuity for President Trump's key immigration enforcement initiatives, while hundreds of thousands of other federal workers remain without salary. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that over 70,000 law enforcement officers across DHS agencies would receive a "supercheck."

          <p>The African Union (AU) suspended Madagascar's membership following a recent coup, prompting renewed debate over the bloc's limited effectiveness in preventing unconstitutional changes of power. Critics argue that the AU's primary mechanism, suspension, is reactionary and often fails to deter military takeovers, as seen in Sudan, Mali, and Burkina Faso. While the AU aims to promote accountability, its respect for member states' sovereignty often delays proactive intervention. Analysts suggest that regional bodies like SADC might play a more direct role in mediation, but ultimately, public will remains a crucial factor in political transitions.</p>

          <p>A CNBC All-America Economic Survey reveals President Trump's net approval rating on the economy has dropped to a record low of -13, with 42% approving and 55% disapproving. This decline is attributed to growing negative sentiment regarding jobs, inflation, and the government shutdown, for which a majority blame congressional Republicans and the president. The survey highlights that independents are particularly critical of Trump's economic policies, including his handling of inflation and tariffs. Overall public confidence in the economy is worsening, with increased job insecurity and expectations of rising prices.</p>
