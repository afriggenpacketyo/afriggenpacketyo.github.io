          <p>A planned visit by a U.S. trade delegation to New Delhi has reportedly been called off, signaling escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The cancellation comes as the U.S. has imposed significant tariffs on Indian exports, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized these measures as unfair, highlighting that other Western nations continue their own trade with Russia. The pause in dialogue creates uncertainty for Indian manufacturers, as the U.S. remains India's largest export partner.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, reaching Category 4 strength after a period of rapid intensification. While the storm caused heavy rain and power outages in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, current meteorological models predict it will remain several hundred miles off the U.S. East Coast. Despite its projected path, authorities are warning of dangerous, life-threatening rip currents and large waves from August 20 to 27, which could cause significant coastal erosion, particularly in North Carolina's Outer Banks.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method to make brain and other organ tissues transparent, allowing for unprecedentedly clear 3D imaging of their internal structures. The technique preserves the tissue's original morphology and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. By preparing the tissue into an "ionic glassy" state at low temperatures, scientists can create vivid, highly accurate models of biological workings and store the preserved samples long-term for further study.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump is reportedly supporting a peace proposal that would see Russia take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would agree to freeze the current front lines in other occupied areas like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This represents a significant shift from seeking a simple ceasefire to pursuing a long-term settlement, an approach Trump confirmed on social media. The proposal faces opposition from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House and has previously rejected surrendering Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' performance was marred by a series of significant errors, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's sloppy play to clinch the head-to-head season series against their rivals.</p>

While Starmer commended Trump's efforts for bringing an end to the conflict "closer than ever before," he emphasized that any path to peace cannot be decided without President Zelensky's direct involvement and agreement.</p>

          <p>Israel's military is preparing to move Palestinians from combat zones to southern Gaza ahead of a planned major offensive, resuming the supply of tents and shelter equipment. This development occurs as families of the remaining Israeli hostages call for a nationwide protest, fearing the offensive will further endanger the captives. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, with the territory's Health Ministry reporting 11 new malnutrition-related deaths in 24 hours.

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the costumed "Zombie Hunter," was convicted for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s. The cold case was solved after 21 years using DNA evidence and genetic genealogy, which linked Miller to the crime scenes. His defense team argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia and have no memory of the killings. Despite this, the judge found him guilty and sentenced him to death for the brutal crimes.</p>

The "scissor wing" sits perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift during takeoff and subsonic flight. As the aircraft accelerates, the wing pivots, swinging to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves at transonic speeds and eventually aligning parallel with the fuselage at Mach 5. In this final configuration, the entire vehicle functions as a "waverider," generating high pressure for lift in hypersonic flight.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those who consider themselves "good people," risk their careers and families for an affair. These triggers include a lifetime of repressed emotions from "always being good," the burnout from perfectionism, having poor personal boundaries often stemming from childhood, or being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst, prompting a re-evaluation of life priorities and making boundaries more permeable.</p>

Recollections include teachers openly mocking students' intelligence and appearance, students carrying shotguns in their trucks in the school parking lot for hunting, and designated smoking areas for students on school property. Other shared memories involve corporal punishment by principals, mandatory naked swimming classes for boys, and an unspoken acceptance of teachers dating students, highlighting a dramatic shift in educational norms and safety standards over the years.</p>

          <h2>UK Experiences Signs of 'False Autumn' as Heatwave and Drought Stress Trees and Wildlife</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an ongoing heatwave, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, with trees shedding leaves and berries ripening weeks ahead of schedule. Experts explain this is not a true seasonal shift but a stress response from nature due to the prolonged hot and dry conditions, which are on track to make this one of the warmest summers on record. This "false autumn" could have negative consequences for wildlife, as an early fruit crop may leave birds with less food for the winter, and hardened soil makes it difficult for animals like badgers to find earthworms.</p>

          <h2>Homeless Man Photographed by Trump Describes Encampment's Swift Removal by Bulldozer</h2>

          <p>Bill Theodie, a 66-year-old homeless man, found himself at the center of a presidential directive after Donald Trump posted a photo of his tent on social media and demanded the immediate removal of such encampments. Just four days later, Mr. Theodie and other residents were forced to leave as a bulldozer was sent in to clear the site, a process he said was rushed and without dialogue. The incident provides a personal perspective on the administration's new crackdown on homelessness in Washington D.C., which involves fast-tracking the removal of encampments that were previously cleared with at least a week's notice.</p>

          <h2>Legal Battle Over British Tycoon's Body Leaves it in Kenyan Mortuary for 11 Years</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has remained in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter and protracted legal feud within his family. Following his death in 2013, his sons from his first marriage accused his second wife and their daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, a claim they denied. The dispute led to the exhumation of his body, but decomposition made the cause of death indeterminable. A magistrate has now closed the inquest, but with the family split on whether to bury him in the UK or Kenya, his final resting place remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021, just as they were returning to school after a major COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured their fears about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from "Do you have a girlfriend yet?" to aspirations of attending university in New York. The exercise, organized by their teacher, served as a poignant reflection on their journey through a secondary school education uniquely disrupted by the pandemic as they now prepare to receive their GCSE exam results.</p>

          <p>During his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump regarding children affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. While officials initially suggested the letter addressed the abduction of Ukrainian children, the released text is more poetic and opaque, urging Putin to "restore their melodic laughter" and act with "a stroke of the pen." The letter does not explicitly mention the abductions for which Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court. Ukrainian officials nevertheless expressed gratitude for the first lady's attention to the issue.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is confronting its dark history as a secretive, abusive religious sect known as Colonia Dignidad. Under founder Paul Schäfer, it served as a torture center for Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, where political prisoners were murdered. Now a tourist destination run by some remaining residents, the site is at the center of a new controversy as the Chilean government plans to expropriate parts of it to create a memorial for the victims. The plan has divided the community, pitting victims' families and some former residents against current inhabitants who fear losing their homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>Rising British heavyweight star Moses Itauma delivered a statement performance, stopping veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their bout. The 20-year-old fighter needed just under two minutes to secure the victory, sending Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hand. The referee waved off the fight after Whyte rose to his feet but was deemed unfit to continue. The win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0 and solidifies his position as a major contender in the heavyweight division.</p>
