          <p>The UK government has signed a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence to enhance productivity across public services. This memorandum of understanding could involve using AI in sectors like education, defense, and the justice system, potentially giving OpenAI access to government data. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stated that AI will be fundamental to driving change and economic growth. The agreement also includes provisions for understanding and mitigating security risks, though it has drawn criticism from groups concerned about the unlicensed use of data.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, killing at least 27 people and injuring over 170. The F-7 jet reportedly experienced a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff, and the pilot, who also died, attempted to steer it toward a less populated area. Eyewitnesses, including students, described the horrific scene of the plane hitting a building and bursting into flames at the end of the school day. The interim government has declared a national day of mourning for the victims, many of whom were children and parents waiting on campus.</p>

          <p>Documents from the UK's National Archives show that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while in office. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair acquired over £75,000 worth of clothes for just £31,000, with discounts negotiated by her personal shopper. The files reveal that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and whether these benefits needed to be declared under a new ministerial code.

          <p>A new analysis from property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has surged by £221 over the past three years. This 21% increase is attributed to high demand from tenants and a shortage of available rental properties. The report highlights the financial pressure on renters, with some having to turn down job opportunities or rely on parental help to afford housing. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in some cities, costs continue to rise sharply in more affordable areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has intensified controversy, focusing on the cockpit voice recording. The data shows that both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" seconds after takeoff, causing a total loss of power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he initiated the cut-off, with the other denying it. This detail has fueled speculation about pilot action, though investigators and pilot associations have urged caution against premature conclusions.

This political analysis suggests that a recent series of posts on various topics—from demanding the Washington Commanders change their name back to weighing in on the Idaho murders—is a strategy to shift the narrative. The accusations come as the administration faces backlash for its handling of the Epstein documents, with some supporters angered by the decision not to release more information. Figures like Rev.

By highlighting these self-defeating domestic hurdles, the tariff crisis may be prompting significant movements toward removing barriers to commerce and freeing up their economies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political commentator Tucker Carlson has disputed Donald Trump's claim that he called to apologize for recent comments. The dispute stems from a newsletter where Carlson accused the president of being "complicit" in Israeli military actions against Iran, after which Trump told reporters Carlson had called to apologize. In a new interview, Carlson flatly denied that such a call took place, though he stated he still likes Trump. This public disagreement marks a notable moment of friction between the president and the influential conservative media figure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has initiated proceedings to deport lawful permanent residents who are accused of supporting violent gangs in Haiti. The move follows the Trump administration's designation of the "Viv Ansanm" gang alliance as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that individuals will not be allowed to enjoy legal status in the U.S. while facilitating criminal organizations. The announcement coincided with the reported arrest in Miami of a prominent Haitian businessman, though his specific connection to the new policy has not been officially clarified.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of FBI surveillance records on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from his family. King's children warned that the files originate from a campaign to discredit their father and urged the public to view them in that context. They also reiterated their belief that King was killed as part of a conspiracy. The release, part of a broader declassification order, has been framed by some critics, like Rev. Al Sharpton, as a political move to distract from the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—that he believes are poised to continue their upward trend, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these "PARC" stocks are emblematic of a market where a handful of names anointed by individual investors can rally relentlessly. While cautioning that these stocks can be volatile, Cramer suggested there is money to be made, provided investors exercise discipline. He believes their rally could continue until a wave of new IPOs increases market supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that the Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and prompting timekeepers to consider an unprecedented adjustment to global time. This acceleration, caused by factors like the moon's pull and changes in the planet's liquid core, could eventually necessitate the first-ever "negative leap second"—removing a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Such a move raises concerns for computer systems that rely on precise timekeeping. Ironically, scientists note that climate change, through the melting of polar ice, is currently counteracting this effect by slightly slowing the planet's rotation.</p>

          <p>This in-depth article analyzes how the Trump administration is leveraging executive orders and a transformed judiciary to advance its agenda, potentially reshaping the balance of power in the U.S. government. Recent Supreme Court rulings have emboldened the administration, which has launched a "full-frontal onslaught" against lower federal court judges who have tried to block its policies. While some see this as a president fulfilling his mandate, many active and retired judges view it as an unprecedented attack on their authority and the rule of law. The piece explores whether these actions will permanently alter the presidency.</p>
