          <p>New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faced scrutiny from the House Ethics Committee for failing to fully comply with the House 'Gift Rule' regarding her 2021 Met Gala appearance. The violation involved underpaying for accessories from a brand and accepting free admission for her fiancé. While the committee found no intentional misconduct, it attributed the issues to delayed payments and staff reliance on vendors. Ocasio-Cortez is now required to make additional payments from personal funds and donate to the Costume Institute to resolve the matter.</p>

The initiative follows France's commitment to recognizing Palestinian statehood, increasing pressure on the UK government. While Starmer acknowledges recognition as a necessary step, he insists it must be part of a broader plan for lasting peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Timeline for Closing on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are increasingly considering Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) to access record amounts of tappable equity, drawn by relatively low borrowing rates. While some lenders advertise quick turnarounds, closing on a HELOC typically takes two to six weeks due to appraisal requirements, underwriting, and documentation. Expediting the process is possible by getting prequalified, gathering documents in advance, inquiring about appraisal waivers, and choosing lenders known for speed. However, federal rules impose a mandatory three-day rescission period, making closures in less than two weeks uncommon. (not investment advice)</p>

This news overshadowed a better-than-expected earnings report, highlighting deep concerns about Intel's ability to compete in the artificial intelligence market dominated by Nvidia.

          <p>This article explores why in-flight Wi-Fi often remains unreliable, despite advancements in technology. The core issue lies not with the Wi-Fi access points on the plane, but with the connection pipe, historically air-to-ground systems, which suffer from dead spots and limited bandwidth. While satellite communication has improved speed and reliability, its seamless rollout across entire fleets is slow due to complex regulations, equipment investment, and aircraft-specific configurations. As passenger expectations for constant connectivity grow, airlines are pressured to treat Wi-Fi as a fundamental service, with full fleet integration projected for 2026.</p>

This incident is particularly contentious given the 2023 German Bundestag's recognition of the 2014 genocide against Yazidis by ISIS.
