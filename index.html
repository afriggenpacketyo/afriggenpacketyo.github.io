          <p>A federal jury has found Tesla partially liable for a fatal 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive damages and an additional $43 million in compensatory damages. The case centered on the death of Naibel Benavides Leon, whose car was struck by a Tesla driver who was distracted. While the driver admitted fault, the jury determined that defects in Tesla's self-driving technology were a significant contributing factor. Tesla has disputed the verdict, calling it "wrong" and has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell by approximately 8% despite a second-quarter earnings report that surpassed most expectations. Investors were reportedly underwhelmed by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and slower growth in its cloud computing division, AWS, compared to competitors like Microsoft and Google. The report highlighted a significant increase in capital expenditures, primarily for AI infrastructure, with the company potentially spending over $118 billion this year. While Amazon demonstrated resilience in navigating trade tariffs, concerns about its competitive position in the AI and cloud markets overshadowed the otherwise strong revenue and retail growth.

          <p>The New York Yankees have released veteran starting pitcher Marcus Stroman to create roster space for their recent trade deadline acquisitions. The team added three new pitchers: David Bednar, Camilo Doval, and Jake Bird, necessitating the move. Stroman, who signed a two-year contract before the 2024 season, had a 6.23 ERA over nine starts this year. The decision was made to release the 34-year-old pitcher instead of optioning a younger player, signaling a strategic shift in the team's pitching staff as they push for the postseason.</p>

          <p>The NFL is reportedly on the verge of acquiring an ownership stake in ESPN, a move expected to be announced by parent company Disney. In exchange for the equity, ESPN is anticipated to take operational control of the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership, which has been under negotiation for over a year, aims to address the challenges of declining pay-TV subscriptions while strengthening the ties between the sports league and its major media partner. The deal could significantly alter the landscape for future media rights negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent tariff actions appear to follow a more coherent, albeit risky, strategy of using tariff threats to secure bilateral trade concessions. Countries that agree to U.S. demands, such as purchasing more American goods, face a lower tariff rate of around 15%, while others are hit with punitive rates of 30% or more to compel compliance. However, this aggressive approach is fraught with uncertainty, facing significant legal challenges that question the president's authority. Furthermore, a weakening jobs report has heightened concerns that the tariff strategy could be contributing to an economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

The move, for which no official reason was given, has sparked outrage from Epstein's victims, who called it "preferential treatment" and a failure of the justice system. The transfer occurred shortly after Maxwell met with a top Justice Department official to discuss the Epstein case. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in recruiting and abusing underage girls.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that France will recognize Palestinian statehood has created deep divisions within the country and exacerbated tensions between its Jewish and Muslim communities. The decision marks a significant shift in French foreign policy on the conflict, drawing praise from many Muslim leaders and sharp criticism from Jewish organizations and conservative politicians. The move comes amid a dramatic rise in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim acts in France. While the public shows some support, many worry about the impact on domestic social cohesion.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's increasing use of unexplained rulings on its "shadow docket," particularly in cases favoring the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh argued against providing detailed explanations for these emergency orders, suggesting it could prematurely "lock in" the justices' views before a case is fully argued. This practice has drawn criticism, including from fellow justices, for lacking transparency and for granting frequent, expedited relief to the administration without public justification, a departure from the court's historical caution.</p>

          <p>For homeowners aged 70, the current financial landscape offers a unique opportunity to leverage home equity through a reverse mortgage.

Based on current principal limit factors, a 70-year-old could access approximately 41% of their home's value, translating to significant funds for retirement. The article explains that the final loan amount depends on home value, interest rates, and fees, and suggests strategies like choosing a line of credit to maximize benefits.

          <p>Activists in Los Angeles are organizing a major protest against the Trump administration, scheduled to take place this Saturday. The march, part of a national day of action, will start at City Hall and is expected to draw thousands of demonstrators.

          <p>England's chances in the decisive final Test against India were hampered by costly dropped catches late on the second day at The Oval. After a volatile day of batting where both teams were bowled out, England's fielders let off Indian opener Yashasvi Jaiswal twice, allowing the tourists to close with a lead of 52 runs. Earlier, an explosive 92-run opening partnership from Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett had given England a brief advantage. However, India's bowlers fought back effectively, leaving the series finely poised heading into the third day of the match.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is suspending approximately $200 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing concerns over "antisemitism and bias." The university's chancellor stated that the move will defund "life-saving research" and is a loss for the entire nation. This action follows a Department of Justice investigation that found UCLA’s response to pro-Palestinian campus protests was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students." The move is part of a broader administration effort to pull funding from prominent universities.</p>

          <p>According to a report from a tech watchdog group, Google has removed more than 50 organizations focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from one of its public funding lists. This purge is part of a larger trend of the company scaling back some of its DEI commitments amid cost-cutting measures and a shifting political landscape hostile to such programs. While Google states that its contributions change annually and the list is not comprehensive, the move has been interpreted as a response to political pressure, including a Trump administration order to end federal DEI programs.</p>
