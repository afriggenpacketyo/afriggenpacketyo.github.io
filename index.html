        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensified attacks, including drone strikes deep inside Russia, and engaged in a second round of peace talks, the Trump administration has adopted a less prominent role in mediating the conflict. President Trump has shown increasing disengagement, despite earlier threats of sanctions against Moscow. U.S. officials expressed disappointment with Russia's demands for a truce, deeming them nonstarters. Despite the ongoing negotiations, attacks from both sides have escalated, with Ukraine claiming significant damage to Russia's strategic bomber fleet and Russia deploying a record number of attack drones and missiles against Ukraine, all while Trump reiterates calls for peace.</p>

          <p>Following the latest round of U.S.-brokered peace talks, Russia launched attacks across multiple Ukrainian cities, resulting in at least seven deaths and 27 injuries. Ukraine's air force reported neutralizing a significant number of incoming Russian drones, while impacts were recorded in 11 locations. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate acts against civilians, asserting that Putin has no genuine interest in peace. Despite participating in negotiations, Russia issued maximalist demands, including Ukrainian withdrawal from claimed regions and limitations on its armed forces, but Zelenskyy maintains that Ukraine will continue to fight back, emphasizing the need for global pressure to achieve a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government faces collapse after Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Freedom Party (PVV), withdrew his party from the governing coalition due to disagreements over immigration policy. Wilders requested additional asylum measures that were dismissed during coalition talks due to legal concerns. His decision ends an uneasy alliance formed in July 2024, potentially triggering snap elections. Former coalition partners have accused Wilders of engineering the crisis, while the opposition has welcomed the collapse, and economists predict minimal immediate economic impact due to the government's limited concrete plans.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has downgraded its forecast for worldwide economic growth due to Donald Trump's tariffs, predicting a slowdown to 2.9%. The OECD's chief economist stated that the increase in trade barriers would negatively impact most countries, and the group also reduced its outlook for the U.S. economy. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs are boosting the economy, recent data shows a contraction in the U.S. economy during the first three months of the year. The OECD also trimmed its expectations for UK growth, citing heightened trade tensions and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal trial has commenced for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who is accused of defaming a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. The employee, Eric Coomer, claims that Lindell falsely accused him of helping to steal the 2020 election, irreparably tarnishing his reputation and leading to death threats. Lindell, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, is expected to testify in his defense. The trial follows Dominion's lawsuit against Fox News, which settled out of court for $787.5 million after being accused of spreading lies about the election.</p>

Meta will purchase 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, covering the entire output of the plant's nuclear reactor. The deal supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to expiring zero-emission credits.

Despite this forecast, concerns are rising about NOAA's capacity to accurately predict and respond to severe storms due to staffing cuts and budget reductions under the Trump administration. Climate scientists have challenged claims of preparedness, citing the loss of experienced personnel and reduced frequency of weather balloon launches.

          <p>The Planet Money newsletter explores the potential of revitalized manufacturing to reduce regional inequality in America. While some economists argue that manufacturing provides good-paying jobs, particularly for those without a college education, others believe that politicians have an unproductive "fetish" for the sector. A debate exists over whether manufacturing can be an engine for widespread economic growth, with proponents emphasizing its potential to create economic ecosystems and attract wealth from outside communities, while critics point to automation and the limitations of tariffs. The article analyzes the potential value of tradable sectors to local communities, but makes no investment recommendations.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after investor KKR withdrew from plans to buy the company, increasing the possibility of government-supervised administration. The UK's largest water company faces significant debts and struggles to fix leaks and modernize infrastructure. The withdrawal was influenced by the politicization of the water industry, and the government has previously stated it is prepared to take over Thames Water if necessary. An independent review suggests the water sector in England and Wales is failing and requires stronger regulation.</p>

          <p>Pregnancy and childbirth in Gaza are increasingly dangerous due to the ongoing conflict and Israeli blockade.

The psychological state of pregnant women is heartbreaking, with many concerned about malnutrition and the ability to breastfeed, as the situation creates an environment of desperation and hopelessness.</p>
