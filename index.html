          <p>Amidst a significant drop in U.S. stock futures driven by escalating tariff concerns, Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain a composed outlook. He cautioned against hasty market exits, emphasizing the importance of understanding individual investment timelines and the potential for market recovery following declines. Cramer acknowledged potential short-term losses but highlighted historical trends, noting that markets often rebound and present missed opportunities for those who exit during downturns. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations on car manufacturers as they transition to electric vehicle production, aiming to support the industry amidst new tariffs imposed by President Trump on imported cars. The changes include increased flexibility in meeting electric vehicle mandate targets and reduced non-compliance fines, seeking to protect and create jobs in the British automotive sector. The government is also considering further support measures as the impact of the tariffs becomes clearer, while opposition parties have criticized the measures as insufficient to boost the industry. Prime Minister Starmer said the non-compliance fine will be reduced to Â£12,000, and people who want to purchase EV's will be supported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst surging global trade tensions and plummeting stock prices, exchanges are implementing trading halts, known as circuit breakers, to prevent market crashes. These measures are triggered when stock prices or futures fall rapidly in a single session, providing a temporary pause to allow for market stabilization. During non-U.S. trading hours, a 7% drop in S&P futures results in a trading halt, while the NYSE has specific thresholds for intraday trading halts based on percentage declines. These circuit breakers are intended to prevent panic selling and maintain market stability during periods of extreme volatility.</p>

          <p>Democrats have sharply criticized President Trump for spending the weekend golfing as the stock market experienced a significant downturn due to his newly imposed tariffs.

Other Democratic representatives and senators also voiced their disapproval, accusing Trump of indifference to the economic fears of the American people and urging a reversal of the tariffs.

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, driven by fears that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession.

This decline follows consecutive 6% drops last week, indicating increasing investor anxiety about the potential economic consequences of the tariffs. The price of oil is a bellwether of economic activity, and this decline is a serious concern. </p>

Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Solana, also suffered losses, triggering long liquidations as traders betting on price increases were forced to sell assets.

          <p>A federal judge has deemed the deportation of a Maryland man to an El Salvador prison as "wholly lawless," ordering the Trump administration to bring him back to the United States. The judge found little evidence to support allegations that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was involved with the MS-13 gang and noted that a previous immigration judge had barred his deportation to El Salvador. The Justice Department has suspended the attorney who conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, and the case has raised concerns about the government's authority to deport individuals without proper legal justification.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Chinese stocks, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The investment bank reduced its 12-month growth estimate for the MSCI China Index to 10% from 16%, and for the CSI300 Index to 17% from 19%. This revision reflects a "high degree of uncertainty" due to the new trade war and potential negotiations. The firm tempered from a more bullish position in February, after DeepSeek, an artificial intelligence start-up on the mainland, released powerful but cost-effective large language models. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is appealing a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) decision to end funding for the state's Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Program. Newsom criticized the decision as "irrational and malicious," arguing that it will harm both farmers and families in need. The LFPA program provides funding for food banks to purchase food from local and socially disadvantaged farmers. The move will impact the food supply and is seen as a setback for food security in California.</p>

          <p>Five years after Megxit, Meghan Markle launches a new lifestyle empire, yet remains divisive, particularly in the UK. While viewing figures are high, popularity remains low, leading experts to question if she can win wider appeal. Despite criticism of her Netflix series and new brand, Meghan's ventures are generating significant interest and sales. The Marmite effect may be beneficial, and her direct approach and humor in responding to criticism suggest a businesswoman focused on a fresh approach and success.</p>

          <p>A second school-aged child has died in Texas from a measles-related illness, amidst a growing outbreak of the virus.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that the Trump administration will not back down from implementing reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, even in the face of a global stock market sell-off. He emphasized that the tariffs are "coming" and that there is no consideration of postponing the start deadline. Lutnick argued that President Trump aims to reset global trade and address the U.S. trade deficit. The tariffs, announced on April 2, have already led to significant market value erosion.</p>
