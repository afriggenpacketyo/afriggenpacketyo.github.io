          <p>Nvidia plans to restart selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients after receiving assurances of license grants from the U.S. government. The move follows a halt in April for these chips, which were specifically designed to comply with export controls. This development is part of a broader preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing, where the U.S. relaxes tech export controls in exchange for China resuming rare earth exports. Nvidia's CEO has been actively lobbying against the controls, citing a significant loss in market share.</p>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Senator Josh Hawley is urging the Department of Homeland Security to declassify all related documents. Hawley argues that the American public deserves full transparency regarding the security failures that allowed the shooter to get a clear shot at the former president. The senator's letter criticizes the Biden administration's Secret Service and DHS for what he calls stonewalling and a lack of accountability. He has requested a complete inventory of materials and a timeline for their public release.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 22:31:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding market forecasts despite facing deflationary pressures and a housing downturn. However, key indicators like retail sales growth slowed, signaling insufficient domestic demand and underlying fragility in the consumer sector. The growth comes as Beijing implements stimulus measures to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs and support its export-oriented industries. Economists remain cautious, suggesting that further fiscal stimulus and structural reforms are necessary to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intense storms have triggered severe flash flooding across the New York metropolitan area, leading to a state of emergency in New Jersey. The heavy rainfall has submerged roads, stalled vehicles, and inundated subway stations, causing significant travel disruptions and property damage. Authorities have conducted numerous rescues of individuals trapped in floodwaters, particularly in areas like Scotch Plains, New Jersey, and Westchester County, New York. The slow-moving storm system has prompted widespread flash flood warnings, urging residents to avoid travel.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the destruction of nearly 500 metric tons of high-energy biscuits intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The food, purchased by USAID for about $800,000, is set to expire after requests to ship it were reportedly ignored following a halt on foreign assistance programs. This move comes despite global food shortages and will cost an additional $130,000 to incinerate. Critics and former aid workers highlight this as an unprecedented waste of resources that could have fed millions of children in crisis zones.</p>

The claimants fear significant financial losses, which they say could impact their community investments and charitable activities.

          <p>The BBC's annual report on top earner salaries often omits many of its biggest stars due to a significant loophole in its disclosure rules. Presenters and actors on many popular shows are not directly employed by the BBC but by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Because these entities compete in the commercial market, their talent payments are not subject to the same transparency requirements. This means the earnings of stars from shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" and "The Traitors" remain undisclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, widely considered the "world's toughest foot race." The grueling 135-mile course starts in Death Valley and involves massive elevation gain in extreme heat. Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after he was unable to complete the event in 2022. Having started running ultramarathons at age 60, his achievement serves as an inspiration, demonstrating extraordinary endurance.</p>

          <p>At least four firefighters have sustained injuries, including blunt force trauma and heat-related illnesses, while fighting several large wildfires in Northern California. Crews are contending with extreme heat, with temperatures exceeding 110 degrees, and difficult, steep terrain in remote forests. The blazes, including the Green fire and the Orleans Complex fires, have burned nearly 20,000 acres and were sparked by lightning strikes earlier in the month. Fire officials noted the extremely dry conditions are hampering containment efforts, with over 1,400 personnel assigned to the blazes.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June on record, driven by a surge of imports as businesses raced to get goods into the U.S. ahead of President Trump's tariff deadlines. Port officials described the 8% year-over-year increase as a "tariff whipsaw effect," with companies trying to avoid higher costs on Chinese goods. While the spike boosted current traffic, executives predict a slowdown in the coming months once new tariffs are in place, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in global trade. Importers noted the significant financial burden the tariffs have already placed on their businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
