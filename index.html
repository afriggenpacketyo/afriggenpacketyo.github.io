          <p>Russia claims to have completed its military operations in the Kursk region, stating that Ukrainian troops have been forced out with the help of North Korean soldiers, a claim Ukraine disputes. President Putin expressed Russia's readiness to resume peace talks with Ukraine without preconditions. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy met with US President Trump at the Vatican, discussing a potential ceasefire and lasting peace. Trump then cast doubt on Putin's sincerity, threatening further sanctions, while blaming his predecessors for the ongoing conflict. Optimism is tempered by conflicting statements and continued military actions.</p>

          <p>David F. Sandberg's "Until Dawn" blends horror tropes with video game mechanics in a self-referential narrative about a group of friends trapped in a time loop at a remote cabin. Based on a PlayStation game, the film incorporates elements of "Evil Dead" and "The Cabin in the Woods," creating a schlocky yet surprising experience. The characters, though archetypal, are fully formed and self-aware, navigating the temporal maze with sardonic humor. While the plot may not make complete sense, the movie's internal logic and embrace of B-movie horror make it a fun romp for genre fans.</p>

Moffett also highlights the risk of backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, impacting iPhone sales. He lowered his Apple price target to $141, implying a significant drop, while noting that carrier unwillingness to absorb tariff costs will further affect consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>
