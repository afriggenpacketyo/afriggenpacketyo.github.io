          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 100% levy on certain imported drugs, a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks, and up to 50% on cabinets and furniture. The stated goal is to shield American manufacturers from what the administration calls a 'flooding' of products from foreign countries. While some economists note that exemptions for companies building factories in the US may lessen the impact on the pharmaceutical sector, trade experts express concern over potential price increases for consumers. The move has drawn criticism from US business groups and international partners who fear economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Sir Menzies 'Ming' Campbell, a distinguished British politician and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has passed away at the age of 84. Before his 28-year career as a Member of Parliament for North East Fife, he was an accomplished Olympic sprinter, holding the UK 100m record for seven years. Remembered as a 'true Liberal giant,' Sir Menzies was highly respected for his principled opposition to the Iraq War and his extensive work in foreign affairs. Political figures from across the spectrum, including Scotland's First Minister John Swinney, have paid tribute to his courteous nature and dedicated public service.</p>

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the Eurovision Song Contest, will conduct a vote among its 68 member countries to decide on Israel's participation in the 2026 competition. The decision comes amid controversy over the ongoing war in Gaza, which has led several nations, including Ireland and the Netherlands, to threaten boycotts if Israel remains involved. A simple majority vote will determine the outcome. Israel's public broadcaster has argued for its continued inclusion, citing its long and successful history in the contest founded on principles of unity, while critics deem participation unconscionable given the humanitarian crisis.</p>

The National Hurricane Center forecasts that it will continue to strengthen significantly over the weekend, potentially becoming a major hurricane. Currently located northeast of the Leeward Islands, the storm is moving northwest and does not pose an immediate threat to land, with no coastal watches or warnings in effect. Forecasters are also monitoring a second weather system in the Caribbean that could develop into a tropical depression and bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>

He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, an act he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge 'unlawful' and 'null' because it was not brought within the required six-month time limit, as the prosecution consent was obtained a day too late.

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, stands accused of murdering his twin sister, Meghan, whom he fatally stabbed in the neck while she slept in 2021. Immediately after the incident, Elliott called 911, claiming he had been sleepwalking and thought it was a dream. The case is perplexing for investigators and the family, as the twins were described as exceptionally close with no history of conflict. A sleep disorder expert who examined Benjamin believes he was in a state of slow-wave sleep, where sleepwalking can occur, and unintentionally killed his sister. Prosecutors remain skeptical and have proceeded with a murder trial, leaving the family facing a devastating legal battle.</p>

          <p>Hashem Abedi, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people, is now facing charges of attempted murder for a prison attack.

The attack, which occurred in April, left three officers hospitalized with stab wounds and burns from boiling liquid. Abedi appeared in court via video link and was remanded in custody, with his next appearance scheduled for October at the Old Bailey.</p>

          <p>A violent clash between rival drug gangs at a prison in Esmeraldas, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of at least 17 inmates, with some victims being decapitated. This incident is the second deadly prison riot in the country within a week, highlighting the escalating crisis within Ecuador's penitentiary system, which has seen around 500 inmates killed since 2021. The violence is attributed to turf wars between gangs linked to international cartels, who use the overcrowded prisons as command centers.

          <p>Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have launched an investigation into the recent ouster of Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The inquiry follows President Trump's public pressure on the Justice Department to prosecute his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey, who was indicted just a day after Siebert's replacement was sworn in. The committee is requesting documents related to Siebert's departure and the appointment of his successor, Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump defense lawyer.

          <p>A debate is unfolding among progressives regarding the effectiveness of political moderation as a strategy to counter President Trump's influence. Some, like columnist Ezra Klein, argue that Democrats should be willing to make uncomfortable strategic concessions to win elections and protect democracy. However, political scientists Jake Grumbach and Adam Bonica contend that the electoral benefits of moderation are minimal or nonexistent in today's nationalized political environment. Their research suggests that factors like national tides and anti-establishment credibility now play a larger role than a candidate's individual ideological positioning, questioning the long-held assumption that centrism is the key to winning over voters.</p>

The author contends that this move ignores the continued popularity of groups like Hamas within the Palestinian population and abandons the long-held policy that statehood should only come through direct negotiations with Israel. The recognition is framed as a dangerous capitulation that legitimizes violence as a path to statehood.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre is demanding that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, be stripped of her royal title. The call comes after the emergence of a 2011 email in which the Duchess referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a 'supreme friend,' seemingly contradicting her public statements of cutting ties with him. Following the email's publication, seven charities have severed their relationship with Ferguson. Ms. Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault after being trafficked by Epstein, died earlier this year.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power in Africa through a growing network of government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. With institutes now in 49 African countries, Beijing offers scholarships and educational opportunities, attracting students like Benin's Miradie Tchekpo, who now works for a Chinese company. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in promoting the Chinese Communist Party's political ideology and potentially interfering with academic freedom at host universities. Analysts argue this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's economic interests, including access to the continent's natural resources.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered that unexploded Nazi-era bombs on the seafloor have become thriving habitats for marine life. An unmanned submersible captured footage of dense populations of animals, including marine worms, crabs, and starfish, living on cruise missiles and other munitions left from World War II. Researchers were particularly surprised to see dozens of starfishes gathered on an exposed block of TNT. While the chemicals are toxic, the hard surfaces of the bombs provide a crucial foundation for life in an area where natural rock formations were previously removed, creating an ironic sanctuary on deadly weapons.</p>

          <p>An Interpol-coordinated operation targeting romance scams and 'sextortion' has resulted in the arrest of 260 suspected cybercriminals across 14 African countries. The sting, funded by the UK, dismantled criminal networks that use social media to defraud victims, who lost a combined total of nearly $2.8 million. Authorities seized numerous devices and forged documents, taking down 81 cyber-crime groups in countries like Ghana, Senegal, and Ivory Coast. Officials report a sharp rise in these digital-enabled crimes, which cause significant financial and psychological harm to vulnerable individuals, particularly the elderly.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that another U.S. government shutdown appears inevitable due to an intractable political standoff between Senate Democrats and the Trump administration. The author suggests that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cannot afford another political retreat, while President Trump views a shutdown as leverage rather than a crisis. Democrats are attempting to frame the fight around protecting healthcare subsidies, but the author contends this complex messaging may fail against a simpler Republican narrative. The piece concludes that the impending shutdown is a predictable, unproductive political farce that will ultimately harm millions of Americans without achieving any meaningful goals for either side.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's remarks linking Tylenol to autism, medical experts are clarifying the existing research and advising caution rather than complete avoidance. Researchers emphasize that while some studies suggest a potential association between frequent acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders, a causal link has not been established. They stress that untreated high fevers pose known, serious risks to a fetus, and acetaminophen remains the safest available option for treatment. The consensus among physicians and organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that pregnant individuals should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time under a doctor's guidance.</p>

          <p>UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk has stated that the university will resist what he views as government interference while remaining compliant with the law and addressing 'valid' concerns raised by the Trump administration. His remarks follow federal actions to rescind research grants over allegations of antisemitism and violations of admissions laws. Frenk affirmed UCLA's commitment to fighting antisemitism but defended academic freedoms regarding admissions and curriculum. He noted that the university is negotiating with the Department of Justice but is also prepared to defend its core principles against federal demands that could undermine its educational and research missions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of ICE data reveals that detained immigrants are being transferred between facilities more frequently and rapidly, a practice that advocates say isolates them from legal and family support. The transfers often move individuals across the country to facilities in states with fewer legal resources, making it harder to fight their cases. Attorneys argue these moves are sometimes used as a retaliatory tactic against detainees who file complaints or protest conditions. The constant movement creates an environment of fear and instability, disrupting legal proceedings and cutting people off from their community networks, which some believe is a deliberate strategy to encourage self-deportation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques President Trump's recent promotion of his 'God Bless the USA Bible' and the 'America Prays' initiative by contrasting his public claims of faith with his often inflammatory and demeaning rhetoric. The author, a Catholic school alumnus, juxtaposes biblical verses on love, humility, and kindness with direct quotes from Trump insulting opponents, dismissing climate change, and vilifying immigrants. The column uses a satirical 'essay topic' format to question whether the President's actions align with the Christian values he espouses. The author concludes by suggesting that true piety requires contrition and a change in behavior, not just performative displays of faith.</p>

Challengers are focusing on issues such as poor jail conditions, the persistence of deputy gangs, and low morale within the department. Luna defends his record, arguing for stability and highlighting the controversies of his predecessor, setting the stage for a heated and competitive campaign over the coming months.</p>

The author acknowledges the real dangers officers face but contends that anonymous, masked agents erode public trust and create an atmosphere of fear, which can incite more conflict. Drawing on the perspective of a former Capitol police officer, the piece suggests that accountability and transparency are crucial for a functioning justice system. Instead of allowing officers to hide their identities, the government should focus on providing better protection and resources to ensure they feel safe performing their duties without masks.</p>

After he published an op-ed about his experience, DHS publicly accused him of assaulting officers during the incident, a claim he denies and which appears to be contradicted by video evidence.
