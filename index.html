          <p>Former President Trump suggested reopening Alcatraz as a federal prison, a proposal met with disbelief and ridicule by tourists visiting the historic site. Visitors questioned the practicality and cost-effectiveness of converting the deteriorated landmark back into a functional penitentiary. Despite the Bureau of Prisons initiating an assessment of the island, many, including San Francisco officials, view the idea as absurd. The island currently serves as a popular tourist destination, drawing 1.4 million visitors annually, and its historical significance is seen as incompatible with a return to its former role as a prison.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts from the Republican challenger to throw out thousands of votes. The ruling is a significant legal victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes. Judge Richard E. Myers II stated that not counting the challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of those voters. The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation and has created a blueprint for future efforts to overturn elections. Optimism Score: 75</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog. Revenue agents, who perform audits, have seen a significant hit, with 31% of those workers leaving. Experts say losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue. The cuts raise questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given the IRS is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue. Optimism Score: 40</p>
