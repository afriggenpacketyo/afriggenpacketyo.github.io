          <p>Thousands of people in Hungary participated in a Pride march in the city of Pecs, defying a police ban recently enabled by the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The government has increasingly restricted LGBTQ+ rights, framing the laws as necessary to 'protect children.' Despite the risk of fines, the march drew a large crowd, including European Parliament members showing solidarity, with protesters waving rainbow flags and condemning what they see as a slide toward dictatorship. Amnesty International has criticized the government's repressive legislation for its chilling effect on the country's LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has publicly condemned the Trump administration's intention to federalize 300 members of the state's National Guard to manage protests near a federal ICE facility. Pritzker described the move as an 'outrageous and un-American' ultimatum, arguing that state and local law enforcement have the situation under control. The White House defended the decision as necessary to quell 'violent riots and lawlessness' that it claims local leaders have failed to address. This political confrontation highlights the escalating tensions between state and federal authorities over the use of military force within U.S. borders.</p>

          <p>Horror icon Elvira, whose real name is Cassandra Peterson, is standing by her criticism of singer Ariana Grande's past behavior, stating she was unimpressed with the singer's apology. Peterson had previously recounted an incident where Grande was allegedly rude and dismissive during a backstage meeting years ago. Grande later apologized via social media, attributing her behavior to an anxiety attack and not recalling the encounter clearly. However, Peterson found the apology insincere and expressed hope that the pop star will learn humility as her career progresses, adding that the experience was disappointing.</p>

          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport experienced a temporary but complete closure of its airspace in the early hours of Sunday, causing flight diversions to nearby airports in Riga and Kaunas. The disruption was reportedly caused by a series of balloons that were potentially heading toward the airport's flight paths. This incident adds to a recent string of European airport closures related to unauthorized aerial objects, such as drones, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in airspace security. Airport authorities confirmed the reason for the closure and advised passengers to check for updates on their flight status.</p>

The incident, which occurred shortly after midnight on Saturday, was described by police as an isolated physical disturbance between two men. According to a local media report, the other man involved claimed he acted in self-defense after Sanchez became aggressive over where his food delivery vehicle was parked.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts explain that 'freshers' flu,' the common wave of illness among new university students, is not a single virus but an assortment of common colds that spread rapidly in a new environment. The phenomenon is exacerbated by students from diverse locations bringing different viruses together in close quarters like lecture halls and dorms. Factors such as stress from adjusting to university life, lack of sleep, poor diet, and increased alcohol consumption during orientation week all contribute to weakening students' immune systems. This creates a perfect storm for widespread, lingering illness at the start of the academic year.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from keeping unaccompanied immigrant children in custody after they turn 18. The ruling halts a policy that would have seen these individuals transferred to adult ICE detention centers rather than being released to less restrictive settings like with relatives or foster families. Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that the practice violates a 2021 court order, marking another judicial check on the administration's controversial immigration policies. The decision came after attorneys reported that shelters were instructed to stop releasing these young adults.</p>

          <p>Reigning Premier League champions Liverpool suffered their second defeat in a week after conceding a 95th-minute goal to lose 2-1 against Chelsea. This result follows a similar late loss to Crystal Palace, highlighting a concerning trend for a team that had started the season by winning matches with late goals of their own. The back-to-back losses have exposed vulnerabilities in Arne Slot's squad, which has struggled to find consistent form despite significant investment in new players. The team's performance has been a pale shadow of their title-winning campaign, raising questions about their ability to retain the championship.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has unveiled a stringent new immigration plan, pledging to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years if they win the next election. The proposal includes a ban on asylum claims for anyone entering the UK without permission and would replace judicial appeals with an internal Home Office process. Under the plan, a rebranded 'Removals Force' would receive doubled funding and wider powers to detain and deport individuals 'within hours or days.' This hardline stance, which includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, sets a clear dividing line with the opposition Labour party.</p>

          <p>Iran has executed six death-row inmates who were accused of conducting attacks in the country's southwest Khuzestan province on behalf of Israel. Iranian authorities alleged the men were responsible for killing police officers and orchestrating bombings. The executions are part of a broader surge in capital punishment in Iran, which has reached its highest level in decades. Human rights organizations have condemned the wave of executions, warning that Iran often relies on closed-door trials and televised 'confessions' that have been coerced through torture, particularly in politically sensitive cases involving espionage or separatism.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly urged Hamas to 'move quickly' to finalize a peace agreement, warning in a social media post that 'all bets will be off' if there are delays. The statement increases pressure on the group to fully accept the U.S.-brokered 20-point plan aimed at ending the two-year conflict with Israel. This diplomatic push comes as a U.S. negotiating team, including envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, travels to Cairo for talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The focus is on finalizing details for a hostage release, a phased Israeli withdrawal, and a prisoner exchange.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, is facing bipartisan backlash after text messages from 2022 surfaced in which he used violent and inflammatory language about a political opponent. In the exchange, Jones mused about hypothetically shooting then-Republican Speaker Todd Gilbert 'two bullets to the head.' Jones has since issued a deep apology, calling his words embarrassing and shameful, and has reached out to Gilbert directly. Both his Democratic running mate, Abigail Spanberger, and his Republican opponents have strongly condemned the threatening language, calling it disqualifying for public office.</p>

His solid performance provides a much-needed positive for the team, which has struggled with its goalkeeping situation this season. While head coach Ruben Amorim noted it was just one game, Lammens' competent display has raised hopes that he could be a reliable option for the team moving forward.</p>

          <p>Turkey is performing a difficult diplomatic balancing act as it faces increased pressure from the United States and other G7 nations to reduce its significant dependence on Russian energy. Russia supplied over 60% of Turkey's oil and 40% of its natural gas last year, often at discounted prices. In response to the pressure, Turkey is not cutting ties but is instead pursuing a strategy of diversification. The state-owned energy company has recently signed long-term contracts for liquified natural gas (LNG) with companies in the U.S. and Australia to expand its sources and ensure long-term energy security.</p>

          <p>The Jack Daniel's distillery in Tennessee is ending its 45-year-old tradition of providing spent grain, a byproduct of the whiskey-making process, as free cattle feed to local farmers. The company, owned by Brown-Forman, states the change is necessary to meet global sustainability goals and will instead send the waste to a new anaerobic digester facility to generate renewable energy. Local farmers, some of whom have built their businesses around this free resource, say the decision will devastate them financially and destroy the small town's economy, accusing the brand of abandoning its community roots.</p>

          <p>The market for traditional acoustic pianos has seen a dramatic decline over the past century, with sales plummeting from over 300,000 in 1925 to just over 17,000 in 2024. Industry professionals attribute the shift to economic pressures on younger generations, who struggle to afford both a house and a large, expensive instrument. As a result, there has been a significant rise in the popularity of digital and hybrid pianos, which offer smaller, more affordable, and technologically advanced options for modern learners. This cultural shift reflects a change in how new generations engage with musical instruments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts project a potential slowdown in Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollment for the upcoming year, as some seniors may opt for original Medicare instead. This shift is attributed to growing awareness of MA plan downsides, such as limited physician networks and restrictive prior authorization requirements. While insurers have been discontinuing some unprofitable plans due to higher medical costs and changes in government payments, the overall market remains stable, with long-term projections still showing growth. However, the rapid expansion seen in recent years is expected to moderate as consumers weigh their options more carefully. (not investment advice)</p>
