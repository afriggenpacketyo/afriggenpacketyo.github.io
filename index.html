          <p>The Justice Department has released a legal opinion asserting that President Trump has the authority to abolish national monuments, contradicting a 1938 determination. This opinion comes as the Interior Department considers changes to monuments to expand U.S. energy production. Environmental groups argue that this opinion does not grant Trump the power to shrink monuments at will, while critics claim monument boundaries hinder mining for critical minerals. The opinion specifically targets monuments designated by Biden, arguing they prioritize recreation over scientific or historical preservation.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of disorder with fireworks and bottles thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The violence, described by police as "racially motivated", resulted in property damage, including arson and smashed windows, with some residents displaying signs indicating the nationalities of those inside their homes. The unrest followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, and a 29-year-old man has been charged in connection with the initial violence. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some criticizing others for their handling of the situation.</p>

Some view the deployment as "un-American" and worry about the precedent it sets, while others, including some naturalized citizens, support the move to quell what they see as violent and shameful protests. The responses highlight the deep divisions within the country regarding immigration policy and the use of military force on domestic soil.</p>
