        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US defense sector relies on critical minerals for its advanced weapon systems but depends heavily on China for these inputs. As Beijing tightens export restrictions, the Pentagon faces increasing risks to military readiness and supply chain security. China dominates the global supply of rare earths, controlling over 90% of the world’s processing and refining, and holds a significant edge in other critical minerals like refined gallium. These elements are essential for various American advanced weapon systems, including precision-guided missiles, fighter jets, naval warships, submarines, and advanced radar systems. More than 80% of the Pentagon’s weapon system supply chains incorporate antimony, gallium, or germanium, which cannot be easily substituted, making the US defense industry vulnerable to Chinese export restrictions. The article reflects a sense of concern regarding the US's reliance on China for critical resources. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has promised increased spending for Scotland in areas such as defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. The Spending Review includes £250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, £750m to bring the UK's most powerful supercomputer to Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus, a carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiative. The review allocates day-to-day spending for the next three financial years and plans capital spending for four years, including spending in Scotland by Whitehall departments, but it does not cover funds spent by Holyrood. Extra funds have been front-loaded, with most of the additional spending in the first two years, followed by tighter budgets, and while defense and the NHS are prioritized, other areas may face cuts. The article conveys a sense of cautious optimism about Scotland's financial future. </p>

Elbegdorj, who terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017, suggested that the Japanese government should disclose more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. He described the death penalty as going against the spirit of democracy and human rights, noting the risk of wrongly convicting individuals.
