          <p>Mario Bustamente Leiva, an undocumented Chilean national, has been federally charged with robbery, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft after allegedly stealing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse at a Washington D.C. restaurant. The incident occurred while Noem was dining with her family and under Secret Service protection.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that border agents are experiencing a "night and day difference" at the U.S.-Mexico border since President Trump took office, citing a significant drop in illegal crossings. According to Customs and Border Protection, illegal border crossings in March fell to the lowest level ever recorded, a 95% decrease from the previous year. Noem attributed the change to the administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, which she says has discouraged people from turning themselves in, knowing they will be released into the United States undocumented with no consequences.</p>
