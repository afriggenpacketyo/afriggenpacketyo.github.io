Among those pardoned are reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, former Rep. Michael Grimm, and ex-Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer. He also commuted the sentence of Hunter Biden associate Jason Galanis. These actions continue a trend of Trump using his clemency power on white-collar criminals, often citing political motivations or claiming the individuals were victims of injustice, sparking controversy and raising questions about the fairness of the justice system.</p>

According to the firm's head of Asia, Aaron Costello, Chinese and Hong Kong stocks are attractively valued and can provide defense amid geopolitical tensions. This sentiment follows Washington and Beijing's agreement to reduce tariffs, which eased some geopolitical risk. Institutional portfolios are starting to shift away from US markets, with Asia benefiting from both relative value and early signs of policy support, which could lead to a surge in global inflows into Chinese stocks (not investment advice).</p>

The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to aggressive crypto crackdowns, coinciding with efforts from the Trump administration to demonstrate support for the crypto industry. Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange, has also forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aiming to be a crypto bank and funneling profits to entities linked to the Trump family (not investment advice).</p>

Since the invasion's start in February 2022, Russia has earned over three times more from hydrocarbon exports than Ukraine has received in aid from its allies. The West's reliance on Russian oil and gas, despite sanctions, undermines efforts to limit Russia's ability to fund its war, as some policymakers fear cutting imports will lead to higher energy prices. Loopholes like the refining of Russian oil in third countries also allow the West to import Russian fossil fuels indirectly.</p>

The event was organized because the town lacks a movie theater, making it difficult for locals to see a film about their hometown.

          <p>Jim Cramer on CNBC discussed the impact of court rulings on President Trump's tariffs on the stock market, noting that the legal challenges inject uncertainty. He suggested that if the judiciary shoots down the tariffs, it could be the easiest way out of the trade nightmare, as it would remove the need for retailers to raise prices. However, uncertainty over the legal challenges has caused positive sentiment to fizzle, as hope for trade deals has fueled the S&P 500's rally in recent weeks. The Trump administration is fighting the lower-court ruling, adding to the market's uncertainty (not investment advice).</p>

The court ruled that agencies have leeway in determining the scope of environmental effects they must consider, as long as their choices are reasonable. The decision, in a case involving a proposed railroad in Utah, limits consideration of upstream and downstream effects of such projects.

Critics express concern over citizens being caught in the dragnet, due process violations, and overcrowded detention centers. Agents with the FBI, HSI, DEA, and ATF have been co-opted from normal priorities to carry out immigration enforcement work, raising concerns that important non-immigration-related investigations are falling by the wayside.</p>

          <p>According to The Atlantic, Trump has expressed rare anger at Putin and mulled sanctions due to Putin's reluctance to agree to a cease-fire in Ukraine and images of violence. Frustration stems from Putin's perceived lack of desire to end the war, causing Trump to feel "tapped along." Trump, long impressed by Putin's strongman image, initially sought a summit to announce the war's end and potentially win a Nobel Peace Prize. Yet, Russia's continued escalation of violence and Putin's defiance have tested their relationship, and despite tension, some worry that Trump may still enable Russia by reducing aid to Ukraine.</p>
