          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to regulate the non-ferrous metals sector, aiming to curb intense competition and optimize industrial structure. The plan projects a modest 1.5% output growth for primary non-ferrous metals this year, a notable decrease from the previous 4.3%, shifting focus from quantity to quality. It emphasizes achieving an average annual growth rate of approximately 5% in value-added output. This initiative also calls for advancements in exploring critical resources like copper, aluminum, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and tin, alongside developing ultra-pure metals and enhancing battery recycling, addressing current challenges like depressed processing fees.</p>

The company intends to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "OFRM." The filing highlighted a significant 66% revenue increase in the first six months of the year, though it also acknowledged a history of losses and an uncertain path to sustained profitability. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint lead underwriters for the proposed offering, aiming to further expand the brand's organic, non-GMO product line for children of all ages.

          <p>With a potential U.S. government shutdown looming on October 1, this article explains the mechanisms and widespread consequences when Congress fails to approve necessary funding bills. A shutdown occurs when federal agencies cannot spend money not explicitly authorized by lawmakers, leading to a halt in most non-essential government functions. While critical personnel like active-duty military and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and continue working without immediate pay, non-essential employees are typically furloughed, though a 2019 law guarantees their eventual back pay. Past shutdowns have cost billions and disrupted numerous public services, and this year's situation is complicated by the possibility of mass layoffs.</p>

          <p>New West Ham manager Nuno Espirito Santo has identified bringing the club's fans and players closer together as his "main priority" following a 1-1 draw against Everton in his first game.

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit initiated by President Trump, who had sued the platform over the temporary suspension of his account following the 2021 Capitol insurrection. This settlement marks the conclusion of a four-year legal dispute, coming after Trump secured similar agreements with Meta and X for their respective account suspensions. The significant portion of the settlement, specifically $22 million, is earmarked for the Trust for the National Mall, designated to support the construction of a planned White House State Ballroom, a project championed by President Trump. The remaining $2.5 million will be distributed among other plaintiffs in the case.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has controversially summoned over 800 generals and admirals from around the globe to Quantico, Virginia, for an in-person meeting, sparking widespread speculation. Critics, including the article's author, question the necessity and security implications of gathering the entire top U.S. military command, especially when advanced teleconferencing is available. Potential reasons range from a "loyalty check" by the least qualified defense secretary in modern history to a personnel shake-up or a declaration of war footing. The unusual secrecy and the presence of the Commander-in-Chief further fuel concerns about the meeting's true purpose.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging President Trump's directive to deploy 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that the president lacks the constitutional authority to federalize the National Guard for this purpose, emphasizing that local officials are capable of maintaining public safety without federal interference. President Trump stated the deployment was necessary to protect federal property from "Antifa and other domestic terrorists" amid ongoing protests. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek also strongly opposed the move, labeling it an unlawful abuse of power that she believes will ultimately compromise the safety of residents.</p>

          <p>Kawhi Leonard has dismissed "conspiracy theories" regarding his endorsement deal with Aspiration Partners, which is now under NBA investigation for potential salary cap circumvention by the Clippers. Leonard asserted that no wrongdoing occurred and that he understood his contract and services. Clippers President Lawrence Frank vehemently defended owner Steve Ballmer and the franchise, expecting the investigation to clear their names. The controversy centers on whether the Clippers facilitated the $28-million deal beyond a simple introduction, with potential severe penalties for the team if violations are found. The article highlights Leonard's denial and the team's confidence in exoneration.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Europe is "not at war ... but no longer at peace" with Russia, underscoring the severe deterioration of diplomatic relations. Speaking at a media event, Merz characterized Russia's ongoing conflict as "a war against our democracy and a war against our freedom," asserting Moscow's intent to undermine European unity. He also reiterated his support for an EU plan to utilize frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's war efforts, projecting that such military support could be sustained for three to five years, potentially making the conflict economically untenable for Russia.</p>

          <p>Europe clinched the 45th Ryder Cup with a 15-13 victory, despite a strong Sunday fightback from the U.S. team, which ultimately highlighted America's strategic deficiencies. The article argues that Europe's superior Ryder Cup culture, meticulous planning, and cohesive strategy, spearheaded by Captain Luke Donald, contrasted sharply with the U.S. team's self-centered leadership and flawed course setup decisions. Donald's focus on collective effort and data-driven partnerships proved decisive, allowing Europe to build an insurmountable lead. The analysis suggests the U.S. struggles to replicate Europe's team-oriented success, often performing better as individuals than as a unified squad.</p>

Atkins, who made history as the first openly LGBTQ+ person to hold both Senate President Pro Tem and Assembly Speaker roles, stressed the importance of Democratic unity against national political challenges.

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating floods in eastern Tennessee, a group of whitewater raft guides has transitioned to "professional trash ladies" to clean up the Nolichucky River. The hurricane's remnants, combined with heavy rains, caused unprecedented geological changes and forced most rafting companies to cease operations. Through state-funded relief grants, out-of-work guides are now paid to remove debris like car parts and household items from the riverbanks, filling large rafts with garbage. This community effort not only provides employment but also aims to restore the watershed, with hopes of reopening for the 2026 season.</p>
