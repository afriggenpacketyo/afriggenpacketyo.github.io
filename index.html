          <p>The Guardian examines the trend of fitness influencers promoting highly structured morning routines, questioning its implications for modern masculinity.

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula behind President Trump's tariff plan, asserting that it is based on flawed assumptions and results in inflated rates. According to economists, the elasticity rate used in the formula is lower than it should be in practice. Adjusting the elasticity assumptions would significantly reduce the tariff rates for most countries. The Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than actual rates.</p>
