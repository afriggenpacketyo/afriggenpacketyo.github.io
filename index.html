          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the fiscal year 2025, estimating 3.1 trillion yen ($21.6 billion), primarily due to the impact of U.S. tariffs implemented by President Trump. The company anticipates a 20.8% decrease in operating profit, despite expected record sales, and U.S. trade policies could reduce operating profit by 180 billion yen. Toyota's president Koji Sato expressed uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of the tariffs, stating the company will focus on developing products tailored to local customers, and the CFO indicated no immediate plans to pass the costs onto consumers.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense stocks are experiencing a surge following heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly after Pakistan's reported use of Chinese-made weapons. Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed that Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets were deployed during a clash with India's air force. AVIC, the manufacturer of the J-10C fighter jets, and its subsidiaries have seen significant stock increases, reflecting investor confidence in the company's role in supplying arms to Pakistan.

          <p>Former Letcher County Sheriff Shawn Stines allegedly shot and killed District Judge Kevin Mullins in his chambers, an event that has unveiled a series of troubling allegations. The shooting is linked to a civil lawsuit against a former sheriff's deputy, Ben Fields, accused of sexual assault against a female defendant, with Stines named as a defendant for alleged failure to supervise Fields. The lawsuit claims Fields coerced the woman into sexual activity within Mullins' chambers in exchange for favorable treatment, and the plaintiff's attorney suggested the courthouse was being used to run a brothel. Stines' attorney claims the former sheriff was paranoid and concerned for his family's safety due to the lawsuit and alleged threats.</p>

          <p>The popular regional Mexican band Los Alegres del Barranco has been charged with promoting criminal activity for projecting images of CJNG leader "El Mencho" during a concert. The band and the concert organizers face potential preventative detention, marking the first legal action in Mexico against a musical group for disseminating content related to drug trafficking. The incident led to the revocation of the band's U.S. visas and follows increased scrutiny of "narcocorridos," a genre that glorifies violence and drug culture. Despite the controversy, the band recently played the narcocorrido at another concert, leading to two new investigations.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the cause of the fire that shut down Heathrow Airport on March 21 "remains unknown." The fire at a nearby electrical substation led to a power outage, causing the airport to close to all flights, affecting hundreds of thousands of journeys worldwide. The National Energy System Operator's (Neso) final report is due by the end of June, and the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence of suspicious activity. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband ordered an urgent investigation to prevent future incidents, and Heathrow welcomed the interim findings, hoping the final report will provide answers.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has presented a somber outlook for the fiscal year, projecting a decline in operating profit by about one-fifth, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump’s tariffs. The company's chief executive, Koji Sato, noted the extreme flux in the auto industry, including trade relations, making it difficult to forecast beyond a two-month tariff impact. This forecast underscores the whiplash effect of Mr. Trump’s tariff agenda on the auto industry, leaving global companies unable to estimate future prospects, particularly with the recent extension of tariffs to auto parts.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the deceased mystery novelist, is now "teaching" an online writing course through BBC Maestro, using a digital likeness created with AI. Academic researchers wrote a script using her writings and archival interviews, and an actor was fitted with an AI-generated “digital prosthetic.” The course coincides with debates about AI ethics, though Christie's family estate approved the project with the stipulation that it use her words and likeness. While creators reject the idea that this is a deepfake, ethicists raise concerns about posthumous consent and the potential for misrepresentation.</p>

A senior British official confirmed the agreement, stating it would benefit both nations, though details remain unclear.

Despite keeping its 2025 profit guidance unchanged, Maersk is navigating a complex tariff landscape sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration's trade policies.

The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and has improved features compared with its predecessor. Nintendo launched the original Switch in 2017, which became its second-best-selling console ever, and the company delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027 has sparked controversy among Russia's allies in Eastern Europe. Slovakia and Hungary criticized the EU's plan as "economic suicide" and a threat to the region's energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico expressed concern that banning Russian energy imports would harm the region and lead to higher energy prices for consumers, cautioning against building a new Iron Curtain between the Western world and Russia.</p>

          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson suggests more criminals could be tagged instead of being imprisoned, but insists he's not "soft on crime." The government is exploring how technology can help monitor offenders in the community and tackle prison violence. While Timpson supports rehabilitating offenders, critics question his views on sentencing and punishment, and the prisons system remains in a state of "crisis" with overcrowding. Increased tagging, using alcohol, GPS, and curfew tags, is being considered, with a new study suggesting curfew tags cut reoffending by 20%.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's steel exports are expected to decline in the second quarter, potentially exacerbating oversupply issues at home, due to the ongoing trade war and increasing protectionism. Analysts and traders forecast a decrease of up to a fifth from the first quarter, with further declines expected later in the year. Washington's tariffs are hindering transshipment trade, and major customers like South Korea and Vietnam are imposing their own duties. Declining exports will likely redirect steel back to China, depressing prices and impacting steelmaker profitability.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its sale in Hong Kong of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains, known as the Piprahwa Gems, after a threat of legal action by the Indian government.

India argued that the relics constituted "inalienable religious and cultural heritage" and that the sale violated Indian and international laws.

The rise is attributed to easing mortgage costs and steady buyer demand, and mortgage rates have continued to fall, with most lenders now offering rates below 4%.</p>

          <p>Four women have filed a lawsuit against Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife, alleging sexual battery, assault, and workplace violations, seeking $50 million in damages. The women, identified as Jane Does, claim they were housekeepers for the Robinsons and were repeatedly sexually assaulted by Robinson, with one claim dating back to 2007. The suit also accuses Robinson's wife of failing to prevent the alleged acts and having prior knowledge of similar cases. The Robinsons' attorney has described the lawsuit as a $50 million extortion attempt and will ask the court to dismiss it.</p>
