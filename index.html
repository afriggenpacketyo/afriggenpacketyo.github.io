          <p>A hot mic captured a conversation between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping at a Beijing military parade where they discussed biotechnology extending human life to 150 years. Putin, via an interpreter, suggested organ transplants could lead to immortality, a notion Xi entertained. In response, a top U.S. transplant surgeon dismissed these claims as scientifically unfounded, stating the focus should be on ethical organ access for current patients, not speculative theories. The exchange highlights the leaders' interest in anti-aging research amid pressing global issues.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has denounced reports of potential White House meddling in the city's election as an "affront to our democracy." The New York Times reported that President Trump's advisers discussed offering administration jobs to incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to clear the field for a race between Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani stated this reveals Trump's preference for Cuomo and is an attempt to subvert the will of New York voters. The campaigns for Adams and Sliwa have denied any contact with the White House regarding such offers.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like Nio and Xpeng must significantly increase their delivery volumes to reach their 2025 break-even targets amid a brutal price war. While second-quarter losses have narrowed due to aggressive discounts boosting sales, the intense competition is straining their financial stability. Nio's CEO stated the company needs to double its recent sales to 50,000 vehicles per month by the fourth quarter to stay on track. Analysts warn that continued heavy losses could threaten the survival of some firms in the highly competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, has been recovered in Argentina 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis. The artwork was rediscovered when it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. Dutch journalists investigating the officer's past spotted the painting, leading to a police investigation and its eventual surrender to authorities. The recovery is a significant development for the heirs of the original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, who are seeking to reclaim over a thousand missing works.</p>

          <p>A massive military parade in Beijing served as a clear message of China's growing power and its ambition to offer an alternative to the American-backed global order. The event, attended by leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, was closely watched by President Donald Trump. The spectacle, combined with a recent economic summit between China, Russia, and India, illustrates how Trump's "America First" trade policies may be fostering new geopolitical alignments that challenge U.S. influence. Analysts suggest this is a concerted effort by Beijing to rewrite global rules, starting with historical narratives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly using the U.S. military for roles traditionally handled by law enforcement, blurring the lines between national defense and crime fighting. A recent lethal airstrike against alleged "narco-terrorists" in the Caribbean marks a significant expansion of the military's counterterrorism mission into anti-drug operations. Domestically, the National Guard has been deployed to U.S. cities to combat what the administration calls "rampant violence." Critics argue this shift away from the military's traditional scope is a problematic precedent, using terrorist designations to legally justify actions that could be turned inward.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had invoked the obscure wartime law to rapidly remove hundreds of individuals accused of being gang members. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" is equivalent to an armed force, thereby invalidating the legal basis for these specific deportations. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy.</p>

The ruling stated the administration failed to follow the proper legal process before cutting off funds for over 900 vital research projects.

The first step is to stop the car, turn off the engine, and check for injuries. If possible, the vehicle should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on; otherwise, occupants should exit and stand well away from traffic. It is essential to call 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the road is blocked.</p>

          <p>An Afghan family is caught in a bureaucratic stalemate, held for months in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center despite being eligible for asylum in Canada. The family, which includes a father who worked with U.S. troops, has immediate relatives in Canada, allowing them to claim asylum at a land border. However, U.S. officials will only release them for air travel, for which they lack the necessary Canadian visas. Their lawyers argue the case highlights how asylum seekers are trapped by shifting U.S. immigration policies and bureaucratic failures.</p>

          <p>In Vladivostok, a Russian port city over 4,000 miles from the front lines, the consequences of the war in Ukraine are deeply felt. The local cemetery has rows of fresh graves for soldiers killed in the conflict, and a new memorial has been erected for "heroes of the Special Military Operation." The war has also impacted local lives directly, with mobilized soldiers returning with life-altering injuries. While some residents express a desire for the war to end, others reflect the official Kremlin narrative, demonstrating that the conflict's presence is undeniable.</p>

          <p>Parents in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of dedicated continence services for children, leading to severe health crises and a 10-year high in hospital admissions for constipation. One mother described how her son's condition was not taken seriously until he was hospitalized 25 times. Health charities report a spike in calls for help, stating that the issue is often dismissed by healthcare professionals. Experts argue that a disparity in services across the country creates a "postcode lottery," failing children who could be treated in the community rather than through emergency hospital care.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program incentivizes illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts. Officials are urging affected individuals to self-deport. This move is part of a broader administration effort to end humanitarian protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.</p>

Two-thirds of respondents reported that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so.

          <p>This article analyzes recent events at the CDC, framing them as a victory for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his anti-vaccine views. After firing the agency's vaccine advisory committee and replacing it with contrarians, Kennedy has seen top CDC leaders resign in protest. In a recent op-ed, he praised his own leadership during a measles outbreak, a response widely criticized by public health officials for promoting unproven remedies and undermining vaccination efforts. The article argues that with fewer senior scientists left at the CDC, Kennedy's influence is now largely unchecked.</p>

For member states like Iran, which faces the potential return of severe international sanctions, integration into such a framework is seen as essential for economic survival.
