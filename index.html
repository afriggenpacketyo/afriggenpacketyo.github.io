          <p>Police in Boulder, Colorado, responded to reports of an attack at the Pearl Street Mall, resulting in multiple injuries. A suspect has been taken into custody, and the FBI is investigating the incident. Initial reports indicated a man with a weapon was setting people on fire, and responding officers found victims with burn-related injuries. The investigation is ongoing to determine the motive and whether a peaceful pro-Israel demonstration in the area was targeted, with authorities urging the public to avoid the area while they secure a vehicle of interest. Boulder police are refraining from labeling the attack as terrorism at this stage. Optimism about a swift and thorough investigation is tempered by the severity of the attack.</p>

          <p>California Democrats gathered for their annual convention to discuss how to stick to their values while reconnecting with voters, particularly working-class Americans, after widespread electoral failures. Speakers like Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urged the party to have hard conversations about winning elections without retreating from their ideals. The article notes that California's progressive policies were often targeted by Republicans during the 2024 election, and delegates expressed concerns about whether the state's brand of liberalism would resonate nationally. Delegates emphasized the need to sharpen messaging on economic issues and focus on improving the quality of life for everyone.</p>

          <p>Exit polls for Poland's presidential election indicate a very close race between conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. Initial exit polls showed Trzaskowski with a slight lead, but later polls reversed the results, putting Nawrocki ahead. With official results due Monday morning, both candidates have addressed their supporters, with Trzaskowski claiming victory and Nawrocki urging his supporters to remain hopeful. The outcome of the election could significantly impact Poland's political landscape and its relationship with the European Union.</p>
