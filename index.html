        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The prosecution argues that Mangione's actions were intended to provoke resistance against the victim's industry and cited the impact of Thompson's death on his family and colleagues. Mangione is expected to plead not guilty to the charges, and his defense attorneys have already condemned the decision to seek the death penalty as barbaric and politically motivated. The Attorney General has already signaled that the Trump administration intends to execute Mangione as part of the president's push to reinstate capital punishment.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's two-way star Travis Hunter, while Shedeur Sanders surprisingly dropped out of the first round entirely. The draft saw a focus on offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the first twelve picks being linemen, and for the first time, the draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This year's draft class isn't considered as talent-laden as 2024's, making predictions more varied.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are finding success in the Russian market by offering vehicles with advanced digital cockpits featuring large video screens and sophisticated in-car entertainment systems. As Western brands have withdrawn from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, Chinese automakers like Chery, Great Wall Motor, and Geely have stepped in to fill the void. These digital features are highly appealing to Russian car buyers, who increasingly seek vehicles that seamlessly integrate online services they use daily on their smartphones. Yandex Auto is partnering with Chinese firms to integrate mapping, entertainment, and e-commerce services into these vehicles.</p>

          <p>Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, went unselected in the first round of the NFL Draft, a significant drop after being considered a potential top pick.

The Cleveland Browns hold the first pick of the second round, offering Sanders a chance to be selected early on Friday evening.

Trump stated that meetings had occurred, while China's Ministry of Commerce insisted there were no current negotiations and called for the removal of unilateral tariffs. This divergence follows recent indications from Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about potential easing of tensions, after the US imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China.

          <p>Joseph Kling, 19, faces aggravated arson and arson charges for allegedly starting the wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, which has consumed over 15,000 acres. Authorities say the fire originated from a bonfire Kling allegedly lit and left unattended, and if convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. The fire, which started in Waretown and spread into Lacey Township, destroyed a commercial building and prompted evacuation orders. While the fire is about 50% contained, it is expected to burn for days, and the smoke has raised air quality concerns in New York City.</p>

This comes as the White House reportedly considers cutting tariffs by more than half on non-strategic Chinese goods, reflecting a possible easing in Trump's stance on China. While many countries received a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, the higher duties on China remained in effect.</p>

However, Newsom expressed concerns about the potential negative impacts of President Donald Trump's tariffs on the state's economy. California's economy is now behind the US, China, and Germany, and it was the fastest-growing among those countries.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea believed to be rich in gas and oil, could become a potential flashpoint between China and the Philippines. This is especially likely if Manila proceeds with unilateral resource exploration to bolster its energy security. However, factors such as Manila's limited development capacity and careful risk assessment by multinational companies could delay the escalation of tensions. Reed Bank is located near the Spratly Islands and is claimed by both Beijing and Manila.</p>
