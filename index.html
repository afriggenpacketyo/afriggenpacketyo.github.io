          <p>Tensions escalated in the South China Sea as China deployed water cannon against Philippine vessels near Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands, with a collision reported during the incident. The Chinese coastguard accused the Philippine vessels of illegally intruding into waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay, landing personnel on the sandbars, and dangerously approaching a Chinese ship. The Philippines has not yet issued a statement. China has urged the Philippines to cease its infringing actions, emphasizing its commitment to protecting its jurisdiction in accordance with the law. Relevant context: Sandy Cay is near Subi Reef, a Chinese military base, and Thitu Island, a Philippine base.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year due to falling international wholesale gas prices. This change means a typical household will save Â£129 annually, reducing the average bill to Â£1,720. However, charities warn that many still struggle with energy costs, owing suppliers about Â£4 billion collectively. The announcement follows Prime Minister Starmer's indication of potential changes to winter fuel payments, with the government hoping to provide more support to pensioners this winter.</p>

          <p>Questions are being raised regarding why President Joe Biden was not tested for prostate cancer for over a decade, leading to a late and aggressive diagnosis. Biden's aides claim that doctors stopped analyzing his PSA levels in 2014, following U.S. regulations for men over 70. However, medical specialists suggest that this may not be standard practice for someone in high public office, especially given Biden's overall health and life expectancy. The debate includes discussions about the accuracy of PSA tests and the availability of newer, more precise testing methods.</p>

          <p>A decision by the Trump administration to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could significantly impact the university's sports teams, potentially wiping out several rosters. Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams have a substantial number of international players, with 21% of athletes listing foreign hometowns. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll international students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" assaulting Jewish students on campus.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to explore holding a face-to-face meeting in June on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada, expressing hope for productive ministerial-level tariff negotiations. During a 45-minute telephone conversation, Ishiba and Trump also agreed on the need to achieve "win-win" bilateral relations through the tariff negotiations. Japan has been urging the United States to rethink its tariff policy, including a 25 percent import duty on cars, due to concerns about its impact on the export-driven Japanese economy.</p>

          <p>The term "DEI hire," short for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion hire, has become a weaponized taunt, reflecting a growing sense that some individuals gain positions due to diversity initiatives rather than merit. This sentiment, amplified by figures like Donald Trump, undermines the achievements of successful individuals from non-traditional backgrounds and feeds into age-old prejudices.

The hydroelectric project, Palo Viejo, utilizes water from five rivers and generates substantial revenue, but provides minimal benefits to the local community.
