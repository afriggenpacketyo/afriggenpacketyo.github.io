          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 19:14:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is reportedly proceeding with the complete demolition of its East Wing to construct a $300 million ballroom, a significant expansion from earlier plans that initially stated the addition would not interfere with the existing building. President Trump defended the project, asserting the East Wing was not substantial and required removal for proper modernization, while also facing questions about transparency. This controversial move has drawn sharp criticism from former First Lady Hillary Clinton and historic preservation groups, who advocate for a pause and public review due to concerns about disrupting the White House's classical design. The administration, however, frames the project as a bold, necessary modernization that aligns with historical improvements to the executive residence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to expand its nationwide immigration crackdown into the San Francisco area, with Border Patrol agents expected to begin operations as early as this week from a U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. Officials state the focus is on "the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens," including those involved in sexual assault and gang activities. California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly denounced these plans, accusing President Trump of creating "conditions for anxiety" and using "un-American tactics" to target immigrant communities. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie also vowed peaceful protests against the federal deployment, which is part of an aggressive, broader expansion of deportation efforts in Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, following President Trump's decision to indefinitely shelve a meeting with Vladimir Putin due to a lack of progress on peace in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these sanctions are necessary to pressure Moscow to end the "senseless war" and cut funding to the Kremlin's "war machine." The move, praised by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, comes amidst intensified Russian bombardments on Ukraine and aims to force a breakthrough in stalled peace negotiations. Russia's embassy in London warned these sanctions would disrupt global fuel supplies and energy security.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane is enjoying a career-best season, scoring 20 goals in 12 club games and leading discussions about his potential to win the Ballon d'Or. Despite his prolific goal-scoring, Kane has never finished higher than 10th in the prestigious awards. The article highlights his exceptional versatility, with experts like Lothar Matthaus praising his ability as a goalscorer, playmaker, and tackler, reinventing the center-forward role. While Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe also boast impressive numbers, Kane's comprehensive contribution across the pitch and his team's success in the Champions League and England's World Cup qualification bolster his chances for the 2026 award.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, 33, has pleaded not guilty in federal court in Louisiana to charges of conspiring to provide material support to a terror organization resulting in death and visa fraud. Al-Muhtadi is accused of being a member of the National Resistance Brigades, a paramilitary group that fought alongside Hamas, and of coordinating armed fighters to cross into Israel after the October 7, 2023, attack. Prosecutors allege he lied on his U.S. visa application, denying terror affiliations and firearm training, and requested ammunition and a bulletproof vest. This article highlights his case as one of the first in a U.S. court for alleged involvement in the attack, with potential penalties including life imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Two Irish police officers were injured and 23 people arrested during a second night of disorder outside a Dublin hotel housing asylum seekers, where stones and fireworks were thrown at authorities. This unrest followed widespread rioting on Tuesday, which saw a police vehicle set on fire, sparked by a protest over an alleged sexual assault of a young girl in the vicinity. Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly condemned the violence, calling it "totally unacceptable" and orchestrated online by "disparate groups." The article emphasizes the distress among families housed in the hotel, including a Ukrainian refugee, and highlights broader community concerns about misdirected anger and the need for accountability for the violence.</p>

          <p>Liverpool achieved an emphatic 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League, a crucial win for manager Arne Slot after four successive losses. Slot made bold tactical changes, benching Mohamed Salah and starting Alexander Isak alongside Huge Ekitike for the first time. While the risks paid off, with Ekitike scoring, Isak suffered a groin injury, raising concerns about his availability. Despite defensive frailties still evident, the article notes the team's impressive high-pressing in the second half and the potential of the Isak-Ekitike partnership, offering a glimpse into Liverpool's future tactical direction, especially with Salah's recent dip in form and upcoming AFCON commitments.</p>

Jouppi was convicted of unknowingly transporting alcohol into a dry village, fined $1,500, and sentenced to three days in jail. Despite lower courts initially deeming the aircraft forfeiture excessive, the Alaska Supreme Court reversed this decision, ruling it was not grossly disproportionate to the offense. The Institute for Justice supports Jouppi, arguing the case is crucial for safeguarding Americans from unconstitutionally excessive financial penalties imposed by the government.</p>

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the move as a "morally corrupt" attempt to "steal the midterms" and announced plans for immediate legal action, citing violations of voting rights.

This follows increased scrutiny on Andrew after he relinquished titles due to growing pressure over his links with the late sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein. Documents reveal Andrew paid a large upfront sum, totaling about £8m, for a 75-year lease, effectively buying out future rent obligations, leading to questions about whether this arrangement is the best deal for taxpayers. The Public Accounts Committee is urged to launch an inquiry into the matter, with some MPs suggesting they have the power to summon the Prince.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations, and forecasted record sales for the current quarter due to strong travel demand and higher fares. The carrier expects unit revenue to rise between 1% and 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% over the same period last year. Despite cutting its full-year 2025 profit forecast in July, Southwest reaffirmed its revised outlook on Wednesday, indicating a stable path forward. The article notes the airline is adapting its long-standing policies, including abandoning open seating and two free checked bags, to better compete with rivals and increase sales, with initial benefits expected in the first quarter.

          <p>The article highlights a recurring issue within MAGA circles: politicians and officials getting into trouble over controversial group chat messages. Recent incidents include a Trump nominee withdrawing after Politico disclosed texts with a racial slur and "Nazi streak" comments, and Young Republican officials making offensive remarks. The Atlantic's editor-in-chief was also inadvertently included in a Signal chat where top Trump administration officials discussed a Yemen bombing, raising security concerns. These leaks underscore a "foolishness about what one puts in writing" and the "eagerness to outdo one’s friends" in bigotry. The article suggests that despite the gravity, accountability for such actions remains inconsistent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its eighth known strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, this time in international waters off Colombia in the Pacific, resulting in two fatalities. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed the strike, stating the vessel was operated by a "designated terrorist organization" involved in narco-trafficking. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly questioned the legal rationale and constitutionality of these strikes, noting Congress was not provided a "secret list" of targeted organizations. The Trump administration asserts it's engaged in a "non-international armed conflict" with cartels due to drug-related deaths.

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as part of an effort to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a move confirmed by Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang. These cuts impact workers across AI infrastructure, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR), and product-related positions. The article notes that top-tier AI hires within TBD Labs, overseen by Wang, were spared, underscoring CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategic bet on new talent over legacy employees. The AI unit was considered "bloated," with teams vying for resources, and these layoffs aim to trim the department and further solidify Wang's leadership in Meta's aggressive AI overhaul.</p>

Gamble criticized the "adversarial approaches" and "misinformation" surrounding the probe, arguing it's being used for political gain rather than serving victims.

          <p>China has announced new export controls on rare earth-related items and processing technologies, citing national security and non-proliferation. This article suggests the measures are a robust response to US tariffs, directly targeting the military supply chains of Western nations, which rely heavily on Chinese rare earths. The US, for instance, depends on China for about 70% of its rare earth imports and lacks domestic processing capacity for heavy rare earths. The controls aim to exploit this dependency, impacting advanced technologies crucial for modern warfare, such as the F-35 fighter jet. This move marks a significant shift in global economic statecraft and ensures a contest between evasion and enforcement.</p>

However, the article notes the browser's experience is surprisingly ordinary, similar to Chrome with ChatGPT features, and raises questions about OpenAI's core mission to "benefit all of humanity" and "cure cancer."

The group had criticized the police response as "ridiculous" and "heavy-handed," suggesting the arrests were for embarrassing the President.
