          <h2>Trump's Auto Part Tariffs Expected to Raise Vehicle Prices and Impact Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:35:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts are anticipated to significantly increase prices for both new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance, impacting consumers. While the administration aims to incentivize domestic automobile production and reduce reliance on foreign components, even cars made in the United States often rely on imported parts. The tariffs will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico meeting trade agreement requirements, and some exemptions will be granted to U.S. carmakers for two years. Automakers express concerns about the long-term impact and uncertainty surrounding trade policy, potentially leading to parts shortages and financial stress for suppliers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:34:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT is designed to help caregivers avoid using "elderspeak," a form of communication resembling baby talk that can be demeaning to older adults. Elderspeak includes using overly simplistic language, inappropriate endearments, and plural pronouns that undermine an individual's autonomy. Studies show that elderspeak can lead to resistance to care among older adults, while CHAT training has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors. The program emphasizes addressing older adults respectfully and recognizing cultural differences in communication styles, promoting a more dignified and effective care environment.</p>

          <p>The retrial of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe, is underway, marked by a complex case with conflicting evidence and questions about police misconduct. The first trial ended in a mistrial, and now special prosecutor Hank Brennan must address the issues surrounding the initial investigation, particularly the conduct of former state trooper Michael Proctor. Key points of contention include the lack of collision injuries on O'Keefe's body, the timeline of a suspicious internet search, and conflicting witness statements about Read's declarations at the scene. The defense focuses on a theory involving dog bites and a community conspiracy.</p>

The election saw a significant defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who struggled with campaign missteps and associations with Trump-era policies. While it remains uncertain if Albanese's party will maintain its parliamentary majority, the election highlighted younger voters' disillusionment with both major parties, with many seeking bolder solutions to the country's challenges.</p>

The MP proposes trials to assess the impact of lifting these restrictions, citing the anomaly that fans of other sports can enjoy alcoholic beverages during games.

The success in both environments suggests that axolotls can adapt to man-made habitats, mitigating the effects of habitat degradation and climate change.

          <p>Women in the Bay Area are leading the nation in delaying motherhood, driven by economic opportunities, progressive social norms, and access to reproductive technology. Three of the five U.S. counties with the highest proportion of women having children at 40 and older are in Northern California. This trend is attributed to women prioritizing careers and life experiences before starting families, supported by employer benefits for fertility treatments and the region's top fertility clinics.</p>

          <h2>USDA Scrambles to Fill Positions After Offering Employees Incentives to Leave</h2>

          <p>The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is attempting to fill 73 critical positions just a day after hundreds of employees left under a deferred resignation offer. This has angered those who accepted the offer, as the government will now pay two salaries for the same jobs. The agency's moves come as the Trump administration seeks to reduce the federal workforce, but the APHIS says it will not compromise critical work.</p>

          <h2>Latino Jockeys Excel in American Horseracing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Latino jockeys, primarily from Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela, make up a significant portion of U.S. competitors in horseracing, bringing a rich tradition and high skill level to the sport. Many enter the U.S. on athlete visas, and while the industry fears potential immigration restrictions, their presence continues to enrich American horseracing. This is a story of Latino excellence.</p>
