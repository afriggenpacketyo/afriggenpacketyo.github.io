          <p>General Motors (GM) surpassed Wall Street's first-quarter estimates but is reevaluating its full-year financial guidance due to potential cost increases and industry uncertainty related to President Trump's auto tariffs. GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson, stated that the prior guidance could not be relied upon until there is more clarity on the economic and regulatory environment. The company is also suspending any additional stock buybacks until further notice. Despite strong first-quarter results, GM cited a negative impact from foreign exchange and increased labor and warranty expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will re-enter the cryptocurrency investment market following a change in the regulatory environment under the Trump administration. SoFi had previously been compelled to discontinue crypto investing in late 2023 as a condition of obtaining a bank charter. The company plans to aggressively push back into crypto, potentially including blockchain capabilities across its product lines. Noto expects SoFi to offer crypto investing by year-end, with broader adoption of crypto technology across lending, savings, spending, investing, and protecting services in the following months.</p>

          <p>Shipments from China to the U.S. are declining significantly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, leading major U.S. retailers to caution about impending supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand at 145%, while China has retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. products. Retailers have rushed to import goods ahead of the tariffs, but with the increased costs, shipments from China have largely ceased.

          <p>Elon Musk's role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration is under scrutiny after 100 days, marked by agency shutdowns and workforce reductions. Musk's cost-cutting efforts, initially promising $2 trillion in savings, have yielded far less, with claims of $160 billion in savings facing verification challenges. The administration's efforts to slash the federal workforce have led to thousands of job cuts, prompting lawsuits and concerns about disruptions to government services.

          <p>Families of Venezuelan migrants detained in the US are drawing comparisons to Latin American dictatorships, alleging "forced disappearances" and inhumane treatment. These individuals have been deported to El Salvador and jailed for supposedly belonging to the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that Trump’s administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization. The detentions and disappearances have sparked fear and uncertainty within the US's Venezuelan community, who express concerns over human rights violations and lack of due process.</p>
