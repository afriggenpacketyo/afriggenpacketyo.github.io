          <p>Harvard University is challenging President Trump's ban on foreign students, arguing it's illegal retaliation for the school's rejection of White House demands. The university's complaint calls the action an attempt to circumvent a previous court order that blocked Homeland Security from revoking Harvard's ability to host foreign students. Harvard asserts that the ban, which targets students coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard, does not qualify as a "class of aliens." The university views the ban as retaliation for its refusal to change disciplinary practices and end diversity programs.</p>
