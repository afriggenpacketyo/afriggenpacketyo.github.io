          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a forthcoming "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country" but did not disclose which country he was referring to. Several US media outlets have speculated that the deal is with the UK, citing sources familiar with the plans. Trump's announcement comes after he imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, followed by a 90-day pause on those levies. The US is also reportedly in trade deal discussions with India and Israel, and continuing talks with Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the recent military actions between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region, following a terrorist attack linked to Pakistan. India conducted strikes targeting locations associated with terrorist groups, while Pakistan claimed to have downed Indian aircraft. Both sides are presenting the events as a victory, but the risk of escalation remains a concern. Diplomats and analysts hope that ongoing back-channel conversations may lead to de-escalation, though the situation remains tense, with each side needing to satisfy domestic audiences while avoiding a full-blown war.</p>

          <p>North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast, according to South Korea's military. The missiles flew up to 800 kilometers before landing in the sea. This marks the sixth missile test by North Korea in 2025. South Korea is sharing information with the United States and Japan regarding the launch. Experts speculate that the tests may be related to exporting missiles to Russia for use in the war against Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The article describes a non-technical person's experience attending a two-day "vibe coding" bootcamp, where they learned to build a functional app using AI-powered code generation tools. The author, who had no prior coding experience, successfully created a negotiation training tool by the end of the weekend. The key takeaways were that vibe coding relies more on prompt engineering than traditional coding, and that AI is making it easier for non-technical individuals to create apps. The author also suggests that AI may decrease the need for hiring expensive software engineers for startups.</p>

          <p>A New York man, Tarek Bazrouk, has been charged with federal hate crimes for allegedly assaulting Jewish protesters at demonstrations in Manhattan. Prosecutors say Bazrouk, 20, repeatedly kicked and punched protesters wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags. The incidents occurred at three separate protests over roughly nine months. A search of his cellphone revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and messages in which he identified himself as a "Jew hater," according to prosecutors. The charges come amidst increased scrutiny of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and the Trump administration's efforts to deport some protesters.</p>
