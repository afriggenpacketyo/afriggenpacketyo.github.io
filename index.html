        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is urging the government to postpone the planned farm inheritance tax changes by a year to allow for proper consideration of alternative schemes that won't harm small family businesses. The proposed tax reforms, which would tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than Â£1 million at a rate of 20%, have sparked protests across the UK due to concerns about their impact on farmers. The Efra Committee emphasized the need for adequate consultation and impact assessment, while the NFU president criticized the policy as fundamentally unfit and destructive. The government defends the reforms as vital and says they will only affect the wealthiest farms. </p>

          <p>In Georgia, a pregnant woman declared brain dead is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says the hospital attributes to the state's abortion ban. The family is distressed that they have no say in the matter due to the law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Doctors are concerned about the fetus's health, as it has fluid on the brain, and the family is grappling with the ethical and emotional implications of the situation. Bioethicists are questioning the legality of requiring life support in such cases. </p>

          <p>For the second time, a federal judge has dismissed a $25 million lawsuit filed by former Sheriff Alex Villanueva against Los Angeles County. Villanueva alleged that county officials defamed him and violated his rights by flagging his personnel file as "do not rehire" after an investigation into harassment claims. The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove Villanueva had been harmed or that the designation had caused him to lose out on a desired position. Villanueva's attorney stated that they would move forward with complaints of defamation and emotional distress in state court. </p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura faced a grueling six-hour cross-examination in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, with defense attorneys attempting to undermine her credibility by presenting years of text messages. The defense sought to portray Ventura as a willing participant in their sexual activities, arguing that she was not coerced into participating in drug-fueled orgies. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade but testified that she began to see a different, violent side of him over time. The trial continues, with concerns about Ventura's pregnancy potentially impacting the schedule. </p>

The documentary 'My Brother the Serial Killer' raised questions about whether Rogers could have been responsible for the 1994 stabbing deaths of Simpsonâ€™s ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, but police and prosecutors dismissed the theory.

Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, aiming to achieve its 2% inflation target.

          <h2>Walmart's Former CEO Says Retailer Can Absorb Tariff Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Simon, Walmart's former U.S. CEO, believes the retailer is strong enough to withstand tariff headwinds without increasing prices. He suggests the company may be overstating challenges tied to tariffs, noting that Walmart's gross profit margin in the U.S. business grew this quarter. Simon is optimistic consumers can largely handle price increases due to a steady jobs market and cheaper fuel prices. He warns that worrisome commentary from corporate executives could be chipping away at consumer confidence. </p>

          <p>Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman has expressed the company's aspiration to hold an IPO in 2025, following clearance from the U.S. government to sell shares to an entity in the United Arab Emirates. The chipmaker, which produces processors for AI workloads, had filed to go public in September but delayed the offering. The clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a key step for Cerebras, which competes with Nvidia in the AI market. The Middle East is becoming a more critical market for AI development. </p>
