          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu, 76, has courageously revealed her nearly 12-year sobriety journey in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," candidly disclosing her past as a high-functioning alcoholic.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 19:01:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK are finding it impossible to move out of their parents' homes due to soaring living costs, according to a recent Skipton Group report. The article highlights the personal struggle of Leoni Clancey, 21, who was forced to move back home after her savings were quickly depleted by utilities, council tax, and rent for her first rental property. Data suggests that nearly 90% of young adults living with parents would face housing costs consuming almost half their income if they moved out independently. This situation, also impacting parents who cannot downsize, underscores a severe housing affordability crisis, prompting calls for the construction of more social homes to alleviate the burden.</p>

The article notes that the show's return was met with a divided public, as both protesters demanding Kimmel's removal and supporters defending free speech gathered outside the LA studio. This event underscores the intense debate surrounding media commentary and political discourse, especially after FCC Chair Brendan Carr's comments about potential risks to broadcast licenses. Notably, local affiliate stations owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair opted to pre-empt the show's return, highlighting the ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police announced a significant breakthrough in an 80-year-old cold case, stating that dismembered female body parts found in 1946 along the Willamette River are now believed to be those of "Oak Grove Jane Doe." This victim represents the state's oldest unidentified case, which went cold in the 1950s after crucial evidence was lost from law enforcement custody.

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off during a Carabao Cup match after receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration of his winning goal, having already received a yellow card. Manager Arne Slot publicly labeled the act as "stupid, not smart," emphasizing that it led to Ekitike's suspension for an upcoming Premier League game against Crystal Palace. The article notes Ekitike's subsequent apology on social media and highlights his otherwise excellent form since joining Liverpool for £69m. Despite the unnecessary dismissal, the player's importance to the team is underscored, and the incident is framed as a crucial learning experience for the young forward.</p>

          <p>Aakash Singh, an associate deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice known for aggressively prosecuting minor crimes, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence four years ago, a Guardian investigation has revealed.

The article details Singh's controversial directives to prioritize charges against protesters and misdemeanors, even allegedly advising new grand juries if initial indictments fail. This revelation raises serious questions about the DoJ's hiring practices, the consistency of its enforcement philosophy, and potential hypocrisy within the administration's "America First" agenda.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office has strongly condemned President Trump's "bigoted" remarks, in which Trump falsely suggested London aims for "sharia law" and has been "so changed" under Khan's leadership.

Khan's spokesperson vehemently rejected the claims, emphasizing London's status as the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and welcomed American citizens. This incident revives a decade-long public spat between the two leaders, with several UK politicians also stepping forward to defend Khan against the unfounded accusations.</p>

          <p>Following the 2024 presidential election, spurious claims of fraud alleging Kamala Harris actually won are proliferating online, drawing significant parallels to the misinformation that followed the 2020 election. This article examines various theories, including an alleged NSA audit claiming Harris's victory, which experts like Stanford political scientist Justin Grimmer unequivocally deem statistically flawed and poorly set up. These claims often rely on abstract interpretations of numerical data, deliberately ignoring real-world election processes and the logistical impossibility of a widespread, silent, bipartisan conspiracy across multiple states. Experts express frustration at the continuous need to debunk these recurring, unfounded theories that erode trust in democratic institutions.</p>

They stress that acetaminophen is one of the few safe options for treating pain and fever in pregnant patients, conditions that pose far greater risks when left untreated.

          <p>President Trump's appearance at the 80th United Nations General Assembly was marked by a chaotic and at times incoherent speech, where he launched attacks on other countries and dismissed climate change efforts as a "con job." Following meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump surprisingly shifted his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. He suggested that NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets violating their airspace and that Ukraine should push to reclaim all its original territory from Russia. This represents a significant, though potentially inconsistent, toughening of his position towards Russia, departing from his previous, more conciliatory approach.</p>

The article questions if this reflects a genuine policy change or merely a "tantrum" from a leader frustrated by humiliation. It highlights the absence of concrete actions to support Ukraine and suggests Trump might be "washing his hands of the conflict," rather than committing to a new strategy.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump officially launched her new global initiative, "Fostering the Future Together," at the UN General Assembly, focusing on children's well-being and artificial intelligence safety. The article highlights the poignant presence of Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska, who urgently sought Trump's attention to raise international awareness about the thousands of Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia since the war began. Despite Trump's brief remarks and immediate departure without greeting her counterparts, her office downplayed the significance of any formal meeting. Zelenska's pressing mission underscores the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and the article notes Trump has previously shown some openness to the issue, even sending a letter to Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Congregation Shaare Zion in Brooklyn has implemented a controversial and unprecedented policy, mandating voter registration for congregants to secure seats for High Holidays services. The synagogue, the largest Syrian one in New York City, cited a need to "avoid a very serious danger" in the upcoming mayoral election, aiming to mobilize its community without explicitly endorsing specific candidates or parties. Scholars of church-state relations and respected rabbinical authorities have questioned the religious permissibility and broader implications of such a requirement, despite the synagogue's stated concerns about public safety and the future of policing in the city.</p>

          <p>Marlon Wayans is publicly defending his latest film, "HIM," against a wave of negative critical reviews, strongly urging fans to form their own independent opinions on the project. The article notes the film's current 29% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, which Wayans contrasts with the initial poor reception of his past "classic" movies that were later embraced by audiences. Wayans emphasized that "innovation is not always embraced and art is to be interpreted and it’s subjective," posting screen grabs of his other films with low critic scores but eventual widespread audience popularity. He encouraged viewers to experience "HIM" firsthand, rather than relying solely on critical consensus.</p>

          <p>A powerful wave of youth-led anti-corruption protests, predominantly fueled by Generation Z, is sweeping across Asia, with significant demonstrations reported in Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The article highlights how young activists, incensed by perceived extravagance of "nepo kids" and deep social inequality, are effectively harnessing social media and AI platforms to mobilize and organize. In Nepal, these protests led to the prime minister's resignation after violent clashes resulted in dozens of deaths. While governments condemn the violence, they have also been compelled to acknowledge protesters' concerns and make some concessions, though the movement faces challenges in translating digital activism into sustained, fundamental social change due to its often leaderless nature.</p>

The article notes that various cost-cutting measures, including scaled-back hiring in the LAPD and LAFD, were instrumental in saving approximately 1,000 jobs. Union leaders praised the collective solidarity that prevented a potential "medical crisis with no health insurance" for some members facing job loss.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has announced a significant rule change, allowing players to challenge called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, utilizing an automated strike zone (ABS) system. Commissioner Rob Manfred stated that this new system strikes a crucial balance, preserving the integral role of the umpire while providing the ability to correct missed calls in high-leverage situations, all without significantly slowing down the game. The article explains that each team will receive two challenges per game, with successful challenges allowing the team to retain their challenge. This system has been extensively tested in minor leagues and spring training, with players expressing a strong preference for the challenge format over a fully automated system, marking a progressive step for the sport.</p>

This move rolls back the platform's previous policy of permanent violations for such offenses and comes amidst increasing Republican pressure on tech companies to reconsider Biden-era speech policies. Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan stated that YouTube's Community Guidelines now permit a wider range of content on these topics and criticized pressure from Biden administration officials to remove certain videos as "unacceptable."

          <p>Michelob Ultra has ascended to become the best-selling beer in the US by volume, marking a significant market turnaround for its parent company, Anheuser-Busch. This achievement comes two years after the company's flagship Bud Light brand lost its top position following a widespread consumer boycott. The article notes that Modelo Especial, the previous leader, experienced sales declines partly attributed to stricter US immigration policies impacting Hispanic consumers. Anheuser-Busch credits Michelob Ultra's success to the launch of its non-alcoholic version and intensified marketing efforts. This shift reflects broader changes in the US beer market, with overall consumption having declined over recent decades.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications in the US has created a significant opportunity for Canada to attract highly skilled foreign workers, according to lawyers and business experts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney acknowledged this potential, hoping to retain talent that might otherwise seek opportunities in the US. The article highlights that previous US H-1B restrictions led multinational companies to increasingly hire in Canada. However, experts caution that Canada's immigration system presents its own challenges, including recent scaled-back immigration policies and generally lower average wages compared to the US, making its long-term appeal for permanent residency somewhat uncertain despite the current opportunity.

Mark Spitznagel, Universa's Chief Investment Officer, attributes this anticipated euphoric rally to the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts and continued easing monetary policy. However, he gravely warns that the US economy remains artificially propped up by the excesses of ultra-loose monetary policy since 2008, and the full, detrimental impact of sharply higher rates from the pandemic era has yet to be felt, leading to an inevitable collapse on the scale of the 1929 crash.

The article describes users posting various videos detailing their preparations, such as unlocking phones to facilitate the spread of "God's Word" or sharing personal "confirmations" of the impending event.
