          <p>A drive-by mass shooting outside the Artis Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. According to police, occupants of a dark SUV opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party late Wednesday night. The victims, ranging in age from 21 to 32, were transported to multiple hospitals with conditions from good to critical. The nightclub and the featured rapper, Mello Buckzz, expressed their sorrow, noting that many of the victims were friends, while authorities continue their investigation with no arrests yet made.</p>

          <p>Following a recent war involving Iran and Israel, diplomatic activity is increasing in the Middle East, with the Trump administration exploring an expansion of the Abraham Accords to include Syria and Lebanon. While proponents see an opportunity for new peace agreements, experts express skepticism, citing the ongoing, active conflicts between Israel and its northern neighbors. Analysts suggest that any potential agreements would likely be limited in scope, such as a non-aggression pact with Syria, and question whether the administration possesses the diplomatic skill to navigate the region's complex political realities and contain Israel's maximalist demands.</p>

          <p>In a significant sign of a potential trade truce, the U.S. has rescinded export controls on chip-design software for China, as confirmed by major industry players Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence. The companies announced they had received letters from the Commerce Department lifting the restrictions that were imposed in May, which had required them to obtain licenses for such exports. This reversal allows them to resume full sales and support to Chinese customers, providing a boost to the U.S.-dominated electronic design automation (EDA) market and signaling a de-escalation in trade tensions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News contends that the perceived left-wing bias of PBS and NPR justifies the Republican push to eliminate their federal funding, a measure included in President Trump's latest spending bill. The author cites a recent PBS NewsHour segment on a CBS News lawsuit as evidence of ongoing bias, arguing that public broadcasters have failed to provide the unbiased news coverage their mandate requires. The piece concludes that taxpayers should no longer be forced to fund what it describes as propaganda for the Democratic Party, and that defunding is now necessary.</p>

          <p>This article argues that commentators like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, often seen as intellectual architects of the Trump movement, hold little real influence over Donald Trump or his base. It points to Trump's decision to strike Iran, which was overwhelmingly supported by Republican voters despite vocal opposition from these figures, as proof that 'Trumpism' is defined solely by Trump's own impulses. The author suggests these influencers are political entrepreneurs using the Trump brand for their own agendas, and that the idea of a coherent, predictable ideology behind Trump's actions is a comforting but false narrative.</p>

Federal loans provide essential protections like income-driven repayment plans, making them a safe starting point for many.

The investigation began after suspicious gold ingots appeared at a U.S. auction, leading authorities to trace them back to the couple and a French diver who confessed to retrieving them.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a 10-year plan to reform England's National Health Service, emphasizing a shift from hospital-centric treatment to community-based care and prevention. The strategy includes establishing hundreds of new neighborhood health hubs, expanding access to weight-loss treatments to combat obesity, and enhancing the use of technology like the NHS app for patient services. While the plan aims to relieve pressure on overcrowded hospitals and cut waiting lists, questions remain about funding, staffing, and the exclusion of immediate reforms for the struggling social care sector.</p>

          <p>In a court hearing for Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty in the 2022 University of Idaho murders, the lead prosecutor detailed the key evidence that solved the case. A crucial breakthrough came when investigators secretly collected trash from Kohberger's family home and found a Q-tip containing his father's DNA, which genetically linked him to DNA found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. The summary also revealed how cell phone tracking and surveillance video placed Kohberger near the victims' home multiple times before the stabbings, though a clear motive for the attack remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations, while the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.1%. The stronger-than-anticipated job growth, primarily in state government and healthcare, comes as the Trump administration's trade policies create economic volatility. Despite concerns that tariffs would slow hiring, the report suggests the economy remains robust, though some private sector data indicated a slight hesitancy to create new positions. The White House has continued to downplay the economic impact of its tariffs ahead of a key deadline next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the ancient wisdom of the Roman philosopher Cicero, particularly from his work "De Officiis," as a guide to achieving lasting happiness. Cicero argued that true, enduring success and contentment are not at odds with moral rectitude but are, in fact, direct results of it. He contended that while people are often tempted by dishonest or selfish shortcuts, the most effective path to both worldly success and personal well-being is through virtuous behavior like justice, honesty, and generosity. Modern social science supports this, showing a strong correlation between ethical living and life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has stated that Germany should establish direct agreements with Afghanistan's Taliban government to facilitate the deportation of convicted Afghan criminals. Currently, Germany does not have official diplomatic ties with the Taliban and has previously relied on third-party mediators like Qatar for such repatriations. The push for direct talks comes amid a heightened focus on migration and security in German politics, with the conservative government vowing to take a harder line on deportations to countries like Afghanistan and Syria.</p>

          <p>A Maryland man was arrested and charged with a felony after allegedly attempting to bring a "ghost gun" into the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. According to police, the untraceable firearm was discovered in the man's bag as it passed through an X-ray scanner at a security checkpoint. The suspect, who is not licensed to carry a firearm in Washington, D.C., told officers he had forgotten the gun was in his bag. This incident marks one of more than 20 arrests for unlawful firearms possession on Capitol grounds this year.</p>

          <h2>Chelsea Faces Midfield Dilemma for Club World Cup Match as MoisÃ©s Caicedo is Suspended</h2>

          <p>Chelsea will be without their linchpin midfielder, MoisÃ©s Caicedo, for their crucial Club World Cup quarter-final match against Palmeiras due to a one-game suspension. Caicedo, a durable and essential player for the team, received a yellow card for dissent in the previous match against Benfica, forcing manager Enzo Maresca to find a replacement. The absence of Chelsea's best tackler is a significant blow, especially as the team prepares to face strong Brazilian opposition, and it creates uncertainty in a midfield that had just begun to gel with its key players starting together.</p>
