            <p>The Metropolitan Police are investigating the felling of an ancient oak tree in Whitewebbs Park, Enfield, after council workers discovered its remains. Estimated to be up to 500 years old, the nationally significant pedunculate oak was protected by an emergency tree preservation order placed on its stump. Local residents and conservation groups expressed outrage, highlighting the tree's importance to Enfield's and the nation's heritage. The incident has renewed calls for stronger legal protection for heritage trees, reminiscent of the public outcry following the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree in 2023.</p>

            <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance expressed optimism about the potential for a trade deal between the UK and the U.S., citing President Trump's fondness for the United Kingdom and its royal family. Vance highlighted the strong cultural affinity between the two nations and suggested that a mutually beneficial agreement could be reached. The UK has so far been spared the worst of the new tariffs, receiving a 10% duty as opposed to the EU's 20% duty. The UK has a more balanced trade relationship with the US, which will help facilitate a trade agreement.</p>

            <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton criticized President Trump's approach to trade, arguing that sweeping tariffs are alienating allies and strategically benefiting China. Bolton contends that by engaging in tariff wars with friendly nations, the U.S. is weakening its position against China, the country he believes truly deserves a trade war. He suggests a united front with allies would be more effective in influencing China's behavior. Bolton characterizes Trump's tariff policy as both an economic and strategic blunder that could have long-term negative consequences for the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amid recent stock market volatility driven by tariff announcements, investors may be tempted to move to cash, however financial advisors warn that this strategy carries risks. While cash offers short-term safety, it historically delivers lower long-term returns than stocks, potentially hindering the achievement of investment goals. Investors should consider their time horizon, financial situation, and risk tolerance when deciding on a cash-stock mix, maintaining enough cash for emergencies and near-term purchases. Diversification across safe and risky assets remains crucial for navigating market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Cuts to U.S. foreign aid are jeopardizing war crimes investigations in Syria, hindering efforts to uncover mass graves and collect evidence against former President Assad's regime.

Human rights investigators are also facing limitations in their ability to process thousands of documents that could help families locate missing loved ones and bring perpetrators to justice. The Trump administration's decision to cut aid, aimed at aligning overseas spending with its foreign policy goals, is prolonging the suffering of Syrian survivors and hindering the country's transition to justice and stability.</p>

            <p>With inflation posing a persistent challenge, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace rising prices while providing a safe investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Current national average CD yields vary by term, with 1-year CDs at 1.94% APY, 3-year CDs at 1.63% APY, and 5-year CDs at 1.62% APY, although top CDs offer significantly higher rates. To secure a good CD rate, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and explore short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Investors can also consider CD laddering to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey suggests that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to incentivize companies to relocate supply chains back to the U.S. The survey found that most companies believe reshoring production would significantly increase costs, leading them to seek lower-tariffed countries instead. Concerns about skilled labor shortages and the administration's inconsistent strategy were also cited as factors discouraging reshoring. Respondents indicated that automation would be a key component of any potential return of manufacturing to the U.S., with a majority expressing the belief that the Trump administration is "bullying corporate America."

            <p>Allison Riggs, a Democratic justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court, is fighting to retain her seat after a recent court ruling paved the way to overturn her election victory. Riggs views the challenge as an "existential threat to democracy", fearing it could establish a playbook for manipulating election outcomes. Her Republican opponent is contesting thousands of votes, despite the voters following all existing rules. Riggs sees her fight as ensuring that the results of the election are honored, which she sees as essential for democracy in the US.</p>

            <p>The inquest into the deaths of four people, including tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his daughter, in the sinking of the yacht Bayesian off the coast of Sicily has been delayed due to ongoing criminal investigations in the UK and Italy. The 56m yacht remains on the seabed and is expected to be recovered in May. The Suffolk coroner stated that a full inquest will not commence until the criminal investigations are completed, which are looking into potential breaches of maritime legislation and possible manslaughter charges.</p>

            <p>Amid economic uncertainty caused by tariffs, some Americans are considering keeping physical cash at home as part of their emergency savings. While not all financial planners deem it essential, some recommend having a small amount on hand for unforeseen circumstances like power outages or natural disasters. Experts suggest a range of $300 to $1,000 in cash for such emergencies, while cautioning against hoarding excessive amounts due to lack of FDIC insurance and potential for loss or theft. It is also important to prioritize building an emergency savings fund in a secure, interest-bearing account.</p>
