          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla are visiting Canada, seen as a message of support amid rising tensions with the United States under President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, invited the royal couple for meetings, including the King's delivery of the "Speech from the Throne" to Parliament, which will defend Canada's sovereignty. The visit follows Trump's suggestions of a U.S. takeover, sparking national pride displays across Canada and a firm stance from Carney that Canada is "not for sale." This is the King's first visit since his cancer diagnosis, symbolizing solidarity with Canada. </p>

The traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, were among 37 prosecuted for rigging interest rate benchmarks. Senior politicians have voiced concerns that the traders have been "scapegoated" and are calling for a public inquiry into evidence of much larger interest rate rigging. The Supreme Court will decide if judges were wrong to tell juries their conduct was unlawful, potentially overturning all remaining convictions. </p>
