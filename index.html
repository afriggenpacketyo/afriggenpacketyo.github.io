          <p>Czech director Robin Kvapil's new documentary, "The Great Patriotic Trip," takes three Czech civilians with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian views to Ukraine to confront the realities of the war. The film, which premiered on the anniversary of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, shows the participants visiting sites of war crimes and destruction, yet their opinions remain largely unchanged. The documentary has sparked intense debate in the Czech Republic, raising concerns about Russian influence and societal divisions ahead of parliamentary elections. Kvapil has received both support and threats for his work, underscoring the sensitive nature of the topic.</p>

          <p>Tommy Fello, a restaurateur, experienced significant recovery from a stroke thanks to the Vivistim System, an FDA-approved vagus nerve stimulation implant. After traditional therapies yielded minor improvements, Fello, the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the device, regained substantial hand and arm function. This technology enhances the brain's neuroplasticity during rehabilitation, offering hope for stroke survivors with moderate to severe deficits.

This statement addresses previous suggestions by US officials about the project's potential geopolitical implications. The CEO emphasizes the project's role as a logistics component, distancing it from international power struggles.</p>

          <p>As a significant portion of wealth is transferred across generations, real estate presents both financial and emotional complexities for families. Wealth advisors recommend strategic planning to minimize taxes, costs, and potential disputes among heirs. Key advice includes transferring property via a will or trust to avoid major capital gains taxes and using LLCs to shield assets from lawsuits. Establishing clear operating agreements for shared properties and setting aside liquid assets for upkeep are also crucial. Planning for the possibility that some heirs may wish to sell is also important, ensuring flexibility and fairness in the inheritance process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has found alarming levels of PFAS "forever chemicals" in the blood of individuals living or working near Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico, significantly exceeding national averages. The contamination stems from PFAS-laden firefighting foam used by the military, which has polluted local drinking water and cropland, even leading to the euthanization of thousands of cows. New Mexico is suing the Air Force to address the widespread pollution, which has serious health implications like cancer and birth defects.

          <p>This opinion article criticizes California Governor Gavin Newsom's social media strategy, which involves mimicking Donald Trump's online behavior to attack his policies. The author argues that this approach, reminiscent of the "resistance" efforts of 2017, is an ineffective form of political parody that fails to cause lasting damage to Trump's mystique. Instead, it reinforces the idea that Trump dictates the terms of engagement, distracting from the need for Democrats to articulate a coherent and relatable alternative vision. The article suggests that while Newsom's actions generate engagement, they may not sway voters or effectively counter the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Astrophysicist Adam Becker, author of "More Everything Forever," argues that Mars is an uninhabitable and "horrible idea" for human settlement, despite the visions of billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. He contends that Mars's harsh environment—including radiation, dust storms, unbreathable air, and poisoned dirt—makes it an unsuitable backup for Earth, even in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Becker criticizes the "space colonization" ideology as a delusion, advocating instead for focusing resources on making Earth a better, more sustainable home. He emphasizes that science fiction should not be mistaken for a literal guide to the future, urging humanity to save itself on its own planet.</p>

          <p>A former Sacramento elementary school teacher, Kim Kenneth Wilson, has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting numerous children. Wilson used his position as head of the campus broadcast club to groom and assault students, often filming his crimes in a private, soundproof room at Del Paso Heights Elementary. Authorities discovered child-sized artificial genitalia and a vast trove of recordings during a search of his home. This horrific case has also led to civil lawsuits against Wilson and the Twin Rivers School District, highlighting systemic failures to protect vulnerable students.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Zoo is grieving the deaths of three long-time resident animals—a polar bear, a giraffe, and a gorilla—within a single challenging week. Maka, a 30-year-old Western lowland gorilla, died from a cardiac event, while Kalluk, a 24-year-old polar bear, and Nicky, a 28-year-old Masai giraffe, were euthanized due to age-related health issues. These animals were beloved by visitors and staff, contributing significantly to conservation efforts. The zoo staff, who form deep bonds with the animals, are finding comfort in the outpouring of public empathy and the knowledge that the animals lived long, well-cared-for lives.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that tinted sunscreens provide a crucial benefit that regular sun protection lacks: blocking visible light radiation. This is particularly important for individuals with darker skin tones who are more prone to hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions exacerbated by visible light. Dermatologists recommend looking for products containing iron oxide, which gives tinted sunscreen its color and effectively scatters visible light. While challenges remain in developing a diverse range of tints, experts encourage its use, highlighting its significance in preventing and managing skin discoloration beyond just UV protection.</p>

          <p>Thousands of artisanal coal miners, known as "zama zamas," in South Africa's Mpumalanga province endure perilous conditions, including toxic gas, tunnel collapses, and subterranean fires, due to poverty and lack of formal employment. These miners extract coal from abandoned sites, providing an essential heating and cooking source for local communities, yet are deemed criminals by the government. Despite new draft legislation to formalize artisanal mining, critics argue it's too narrow and could criminalize entire communities. The article highlights the systemic failures of mining companies and the state to support these marginalized workers, leading to tragic deaths and ongoing struggles for survival.</p>

The eruption is contained within the Halemaumau Crater, posing no threat to homes, and offers spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma pressure causes these "Champagne bottle" eruptions, which have occurred periodically over the past 200 years. Native Hawaiians view lava flows as a natural resource that forms land, carrying stories of the volcano goddess Pele, highlighting the cultural significance alongside the scientific observation of this active geological phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Utility bills are rapidly increasing across the US, with electricity and natural gas costs significantly higher than a year ago, impacting over 57 million Americans. This surge is primarily attributed to rapidly expanding demand from AI data centers, oil and gas drilling, and electrified transportation, coupled with transmission shortages. While President Trump blames renewables, experts point to supply scarcity, tariffs, equipment shortages, and the administration's policies curtailing clean energy projects as major factors. Analysis suggests Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could further increase energy prices and lead to job losses, despite efforts to keep fossil fuel generation online. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is actively expanding its defense partnerships with various allies, including the UK and US, as evidenced by recent multinational military exercises in the Philippine Sea. This strategic shift, according to analysts, is partly a response to perceived "mixed signals" from the US and growing concerns over China's regional assertiveness. The joint F-35 training on the Japanese destroyer-carrier JS Kaga highlights a move towards deeper tactical integration among allied forces. This proactive approach aims to bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, reflecting Japan's evolving defense posture in a complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Applications for the T visa, a crucial lifeline for human trafficking survivors, are surging, yet applicants face significantly longer processing times and heightened deportation risks. This increase is attributed to greater awareness of the visa and expanding legal definitions of trafficking, alongside barriers to other immigration pathways. While USCIS implemented a "bona fide determination" process for earlier benefits, policies under the Trump administration and recent guidance have expanded circumstances for issuing notices to appear (NTAs), leaving denied applicants vulnerable to removal proceedings.

This decision comes after decades of lobbying by civil society groups and a recent legal battle, which residents unsuccessfully tried to block. The original name carried overt racist connotations, stemming from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany. The renaming, coinciding with International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, is a significant act of decolonization, recognizing Black history, achievement, and resilience in Germany.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that "South Park" has become the most significant topical comedy show in the Trump 2.0 era, succeeding where other satires have fallen short. The article attributes the show's effectiveness to creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's "allergy to clapter" and their willingness to deliver "gratifyingly mean caricatures" of figures like Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem. Unlike other shows, "South Park" avoids moralizing, instead using its unique comedic toolkit to draw sharp, spiteful comparisons and critique the absurdity and cruelty of the administration. This approach resonates by making the challenging political landscape funny without glorifying it.</p>
