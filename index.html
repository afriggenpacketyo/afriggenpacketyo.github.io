          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following reports of alleged race-based discrimination at the prestigious legal journal. These investigations come amidst ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard, including demands to dismantle DEI programs and increased scrutiny of international students. The administration had previously frozen $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard over concerns about antisemitism on campus, marking an escalation in the conflict between the federal government and the Ivy League institution.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers, led by former ASML scientist Lin Nan, have reportedly developed an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source platform that meets international standards, potentially overcoming restrictions on importing advanced EUV lithography machines from ASML. This breakthrough could enable China to produce advanced chips with nodes below seven nanometers domestically, reducing reliance on foreign technology. Lin Nan returned to China in 2021 to lead the research after previously working at ASML, the sole manufacturer of EUV machines. This development could accelerate China's progress in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.</p>

The government is also consulting on reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml, aiming to further incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar content in their products.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer expressed increasing optimism about Boeing's stock, citing a recent analyst report highlighting the company's progress. Bernstein upgraded Boeing to an outperform buy, raising its target price due to improvements in commercial aircraft production. Cramer noted that Boeing's planes could potentially be used as a bargaining chip to lower trade deficits. Bernstein said it would exercise caution as Boeing strives for subsequent production rates as high as 57 per month, on the concern that "Boeing has not done such rapid rate breaks before."
