          <p>A diver died during an operation to recover a superyacht that sank off Sicily last year, resulting in the deaths of a U.K. tech mogul and six others; this prompted authorities to suspend the recovery work. The diver was part of a team working to raise the "Bayesian" yacht, which sank after being struck by a storm in August of the previous year. The incident led to investigations into the captain and three others on suspicion of manslaughter and negligent shipwreck. The yacht belonged to Mike Lynch, who had invited friends and family to celebrate his recent acquittal in a U.S. fraud case.</p>

Roscosmos reported that the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere and impacted the ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, with no immediate reports of damage. The mission was part of the Venera program, aimed at studying Venus's surface and atmosphere, but Kosmos 482 remained in Earth's orbit for over half a century before its descent.</p>

Veterans initiated the project to provide a more accessible location than the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The memorial features three oak pillars representing the Navy, Army, and Air Force.</p>
