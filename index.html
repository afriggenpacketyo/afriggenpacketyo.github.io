          <p>Over 63 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to classify Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The protests in cities like London, Bristol, and Manchester saw many participants, including elderly individuals, detained for displaying placards in support of the group. This proscription, which criminalizes support for Palestine Action, followed an incident where activists caused significant damage at an RAF base. The ban is currently being challenged in the High Court.</p>

          <p>A car intentionally plowed into a crowd outside a music venue in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring at least 30 people, with many in critical or serious condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after the driver was reportedly removed from a nearby business. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted them, during which an unknown individual shot the driver and fled the scene.

          <p>Former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne has once again publicly criticized The New York Times for a 2022 article about her that used the headline "Sex Sells." Dunne alleges the newspaper's staff instructed her to wear her team leotard for a photoshoot and then used the image to suggest that female athletes' NIL earnings reward feminine desirability over athletic skill. She described the incident on a podcast, reiterating her view that the publication used her image for "clicks" and misrepresented the situation. Dunne has previously called the article "BS" and noted her social media response led to a modeling offer from Sports Illustrated.</p>

          <p>According to witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza, Israeli forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to access food from distribution sites, resulting in 32 deaths. The incidents occurred near hubs operated by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the southern part of the territory. The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects who approached its forces, while the GHF denied any incidents occurred at or near its sites when they were open. This violence highlights the ongoing dangers and chaos surrounding aid distribution amid Gaza's severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The article reports that U.S. Senator Marco Rubio announced a move to revoke the U.S. visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. This action is framed as part of a broader campaign by allies of Donald Trump to support Bolsonaro, who faces trial for an alleged coup attempt. The move follows Trump's threat of imposing 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which has been criticized in Brazil as "unacceptable blackmail" and an infringement on national sovereignty. The interventions have reportedly caused a nationalist backlash in Brazil, potentially backfiring on Bolsonaro's supporters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that releasing grand jury transcripts related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell will not satisfy "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." This comment comes after the Department of Justice, at Trump's request, asked federal judges to unseal the testimonies following sustained pressure on the administration. Trump's social media post suggests he believes critics will continue to demand more regardless of what is released.

          <p>Economists are evaluating the effects of President Trump's tariffs, noting a mixed record of outcomes. The policies have generated significant tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing, aligning with the administration's "America First" goals. However, analysts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and uncertain, while the tariffs have begun to increase consumer prices for some imported goods, risking inflation. With the recent announcement of new tariffs on major trade partners, the long-term economic consequences and stability of the policy remain under scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond the legal fight, such an unprecedented move would threaten the central bank's independence, potentially leading to market volatility, higher inflation, and increased borrowing costs as the Fed's credibility is undermined.

This method bypasses the traditional bipartisan process requiring a 60-vote majority in the Senate.

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnet reportedly pulled the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing fatal injuries. Medical experts stress the extreme danger of bringing metal objects near an active MRI and note that strict safety protocols are in place to prevent such rare but catastrophic incidents.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the Trump administration, particularly through Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is undermining public health by promoting anti-vaccine sentiment. The author points to rising measles cases and Kennedy's unilateral decision to stop recommending COVID-19 boosters for healthy children and pregnant women, a move opposed by medical associations. The piece highlights recent surveys showing a majority of pregnant women and parents of young children do not intend to fully vaccinate their kids. The author argues this trend represents a dangerous reversal of decades of medical progress, driven by political ideology.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have vowed to intensify their crackdown on the smuggling of strategic minerals, stating the situation remains "severe." Following a special operation launched in May that led to multiple arrests, officials announced plans for a new joint enforcement center for dual-use item export controls. The government warned that some offenders are colluding with foreign parties and using covert tactics like false declarations to illegally export minerals and related technologies. The crackdown aims to prevent the illicit outflow of these critical resources from the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Americans on average believe a net worth of $839,000 would make them financially comfortable, financial experts argue this metric can be misleading. Certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh notes that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't reflect one's actual financial reality or cash flow. True financial comfort, she suggests, comes from aligning money management with personal values and goals, such as security or freedom, rather than chasing a specific number. Experts advise focusing on practical steps like managing debt, building savings, and investing for the future to achieve a genuine sense of well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that a recent IRS policy change, which allows clergy to endorse political candidates without risking their church's nonprofit status, is a "Faustian bargain." The author contends that while some evangelical groups see this as a First Amendment victory, it risks turning churches into partisan political organizations. This shift could lead to churches being funded by PACs, alienating congregants with different political views, and prioritizing political directives over the formation of individual conscience. The article praises the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for maintaining its policy against making endorsements, advocating for a focus on moral guidance instead.</p>

          <p>Steel conglomerate ArcelorMittal has halted its decarbonization plans for two German steelworks, casting doubt on Germany's ambitious green steel transition. The company cited slower-than-expected progress in the energy transition, the high cost of hydrogen-based production, and a weak European steel market as reasons for its withdrawal. The move highlights major challenges for the industry, including the high cost and insufficient supply of green hydrogen, which is meant to replace coal. While some German steelmakers remain committed, the setback underscores the difficulty of achieving Germany's 2045 carbon-neutrality goal. (not investment advice)</p>

Public health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence for this link; in fact, UV radiation is the main cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products, not modern sunscreens.

          <p>Despite a large parliamentary majority, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's authority is being questioned, according to this analysis. The recent ousting of a few rebellious backbench MPs is seen by some not as a sign of strength, but as a reaction to a perceived lack of control within his party. The government also faces significant constraints from financial markets, which limit its spending power and influence its policy decisions to avoid the instability seen under previous administrations. This combination of internal party dissent and external economic pressure creates a sense that the government is not fully in command.</p>
