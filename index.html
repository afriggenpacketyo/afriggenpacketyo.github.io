        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally notified Congress that it considers the U.S. to be in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations. This declaration followed a series of military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, which resulted in multiple fatalities. The notification labels those killed as "unlawful combatants," a term previously used for terrorist networks, though Congress has not authorized military force against cartels. Critics, including former State Department officials and some members of Congress, have questioned the legal justification for these actions, arguing the facts do not support the claim of an armed attack on the United States.</p>

          <p>A Political Action Committee led by activist David Hogg, named Leaders We Deserve, has reportedly spent a significant portion of its funds on consultants and advertising rather than direct candidate support. According to federal campaign filings, the PAC spent approximately $2.5 million on consultants and over $1 million on digital ads, while contributing $455,000 to three candidates in the first eight months of 2025. The group, which pledged to spend $20 million on progressive candidates, defended its expenditures as long-term investments expected to yield higher returns for donations later in the election cycle. The spending practices have drawn criticism for their high operational costs relative to direct political contributions.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of compassion, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from Utah has raised over $300,000 for the family of the gunman who attacked a Michigan chapel, killing four people. David Butler started the crowdfunding campaign after learning the deceased suspect left behind a wife and children, including one with a chronic illness. Citing his faith's teaching to "love our enemies" and care for widows and orphans, Butler sought to help a family he saw as additional victims of the tragedy. The campaign far exceeded its initial $10,000 goal, drawing support primarily from other members of the faith.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors now hold approximately US$21 billion in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen returns of 42% this year, tracking the metal's significant price increase. Financial analysts from several major banks predict that gold prices could continue to climb, potentially reaching over US$4,000 an ounce in the next year. This rally is attributed to several factors, including robust demand from global central banks seeking to diversify reserves, a weaker U.S. dollar, and ongoing geopolitical risks. The strong performance of gold provides a stark contrast to other market trends and highlights its role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 Europa League defeat to Sturm Graz, Rangers head coach Russell Martin once again attributed his team's struggles to a "mentality problem" rather than tactical or technical shortcomings.

The loss in Austria featured familiar defensive errors, including what a former player called "schoolboy stuff," leading to both of the opposition's goals. The predictable on-field results and the manager's consistent post-game assessment have intensified pressure and frustration among the club's supporters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked nine prominent U.S. universities to sign a "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which would grant them preferential access to federal funding. In return, the institutions must agree to several conditions, including freezing tuition for five years, banning the use of sex and gender in admissions, and capping international student enrollment. The agreement also demands the abolition of institutional units perceived as hostile to conservative ideas. While the White House stated that funding would not be limited only to signatories, those who agree to the compact will be prioritized for federal grants and partnerships.</p>

The case highlights a broader societal issue where medical disinformation, often spread on social media, can have life-threatening consequences.

His leadership has reportedly been marked by high-profile resignations, leak investigations, and a growing paranoia that has caused him to rely on a small circle of personal loyalists.

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study reveals that a growing number of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, making it increasingly difficult to save for retirement. Approximately 42% of working Americans across Gen Z, Millennial, and Gen X generations report having no spare savings after covering basic living expenses, up from 31% in 1997. The report attributes this trend to the rising costs of essentials like housing and healthcare, which consume a larger share of income than in previous decades. This financial pressure challenges the conventional advice to simply "save more" and highlights a systemic problem that could widen the retirement savings gap. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the article also highlights Celtic's self-inflicted wounds, including a significant goalkeeping error on Braga's opening goal and a general lack of offensive creativity.

          <h2>Fact-Check: Examining Republican Claims That Democrats Want Free Healthcare for Undocumented Migrants</h2>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis examines the claim that Democrats initiated the government shutdown to secure free healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The report clarifies that Democrats are pushing to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and reverse cuts to Medicaid, programs for which undocumented individuals are not eligible under federal law. The Republican claim appears to stem from a Democratic proposal to repeal a new provision in a Trump administration bill that would strip healthcare access from certain categories of lawfully present immigrants, such as refugees and victims of trafficking. Democratic leaders have explicitly stated they are not seeking to change the law regarding undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to reduce the cost of its drugs in the United States to match the lower prices it charges in other developed countries. This concession, a long-sought goal for President Trump, was achieved after the administration threatened to impose 100% tariffs on drug companies that did not comply with its pricing demands. As part of the agreement, Pfizer will also participate in a new government website, TrumpRx, offering certain drugs at steep discounts. While the immediate financial relief for patients is still unclear, the deal marks a significant symbolic victory in the administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs.</p>

          <p>This article traces the history of college rankings in the United States, from a controversial and quickly suppressed federal report in 1911 to the influential annual list published by U.S. News & World Report today. Early attempts to classify universities were met with institutional outrage, but the landscape shifted as higher education became a mass-consumer good in the latter half of the 20th century. By the 1980s, the demand for a guide to the American meritocracy created fertile ground for rankings to become a cultural staple. The essay argues these lists have profoundly shaped public perception and institutional behavior, often reflecting societal anxieties more than objective educational quality.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that focusing solely on stagnation in China's economy overlooks a profound transformation being driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Born in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, this cohort is described as technically trained, innovation-focused, and adept at co-creation with government and global partners. Unlike their predecessors who often relied on informal networks, these business leaders are leveraging technology and market opportunities to drive competitiveness at scale. The article suggests this entrepreneurial dynamism is a key, often undervalued, aspect of China's economic resilience and ongoing restructuring.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has openly stated his intention to use the government shutdown as a tool to cut funding for what he terms "Democratic Agencies," contradicting earlier assurances from his Vice President. In a social media post, Trump announced a meeting with OMB Director Russ Vought, whom he noted for his connection to the conservative playbook Project 2025, to determine which cuts would be made. This explicit threat to target political opponents has been defended by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who argued Democrats forced the situation, but it has been condemned by others as an unconstitutional and politically motivated abuse of power.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered over 1,000 Spanish silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, off Florida's "treasure coast." The coins were recovered from the wreckage of a Spanish fleet that was destroyed by a hurricane on July 31, 1715, while transporting wealth from the colonies back to Spain. The salvage company, 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels LLC, noted that many of the coins still have visible dates and mint marks from their origins in what are now Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. This discovery provides a tangible link to the history of the Spanish empire's golden age.</p>

          <p>Conservation groups are urging the public to stay away from U.S. national parks during the government shutdown, citing safety concerns due to severely limited staffing. The National Parks Conservation Association warned that with more than half of the National Park Service workforce on furlough, visitors will be largely on their own with reduced access to facilities and emergency services. This situation raises fears of a repeat of the 2018 shutdown, during which understaffed parks suffered from vandalism, littering, and damage to natural resources. The decision to keep parks partially open is being called "reckless" by former park superintendents.</p>

The essay aims to demystify the religion, explaining its core tenets of balance, health, and connection to nature through deities called orishas. Scholars featured in the piece argue that widespread, negative stereotypes about the religion, particularly concerning practices like animal sacrifice, are rooted in colonial and anti-Black efforts to demonize African traditions. The religion is presented not as "black magic," but as a system for collective healing and remembrance.</p>

The call for a boycott is in response to conservative backlash against the show, which featured a transgender main character and was canceled in 2023 after two seasons. Musk's post amplified accusations that Netflix is pushing a "transgender woke agenda."

An internal NHS inquiry identified issues including clinical errors, performing operations beyond her level of experience, and failing to seek help from senior colleagues. Despite serious concerns being raised by her peers as early as 2018, the hospital did not launch a formal investigation until 2021. Ms. Booth is currently working for the NHS in a non-surgical mentorship role, with plans for her to resume her surgical career.</p>
