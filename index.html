          <h2>Trump and Fed Chair Powell Publicly Disagree on Renovation Costs During Presidential Visit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:48:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve, engaging in a public dispute with Chairman Jerome Powell over the cost of the headquarters' renovation. Trump claimed costs topped $3.1 billion, a figure Powell corrected by stating it improperly included a separate building completed years ago. The unprecedented visit is widely viewed as part of Trump's ongoing pressure campaign to influence the Fed to lower interest rates. Despite previous threats, Trump stated it was "not necessary" to fire Powell, though he reiterated his desire for rate cuts to spur the economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of EE and BT customers across the UK experienced a significant network outage, leaving them unable to make or receive voice calls. The technical fault also temporarily impacted some users' ability to contact 999 emergency services, although the government confirmed this access was later restored. BT, which owns EE, has since announced that the problem has been resolved and service is back to normal. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is in contact with BT to determine the cause and scale of the disruption to the critical communication networks.</p>

          <p>Job postings mentioning artificial intelligence skills are rapidly increasing as more companies integrate AI into their operations, according to a new report. Over the past year, such listings have more than doubled, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years. While these roles still constitute a small portion of the overall labor market, they offer significantly higher pay, averaging 28% more than similar positions without an AI requirement. The growth is concentrated in tech hubs but is also spreading to other regions and non-tech fields like finance and marketing.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is enacting a new, less visible form of family separation by dismantling protections for unaccompanied migrant children. Instead of physical separation at the border, the administration is using bureaucratic hurdles, such as stricter requirements for family sponsors and defunding legal aid services, to keep children in detention longer. These policies are framed as child welfare initiatives but effectively weaponize the system against families. The changes create a difficult choice for relatives: either provide sensitive personal data to the government to reclaim a child or leave the child in federal custody indefinitely.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock dropped 8% after the company reported that its automotive revenue fell by 16% year-over-year, marking the second straight quarter of declining sales. Total revenue also missed analyst estimates, falling 12% to $22.5 billion amid increasing competition from lower-cost EV manufacturers, particularly in China and Europe. CEO Elon Musk warned investors of potential "rough quarters" ahead, citing the upcoming expiration of federal EV tax credits. The company provided no official guidance for future growth, a departure from previous statements, signaling continued uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England cricket captain Ben Stokes has made a remarkable return to form as a premier bowler during the current Test series against India, eight months after a significant hamstring injury. His recent five-wicket haul was his first since 2017, a testament to his intensive rehabilitation and a significant boost for his team. Stokes has bowled with renewed pace and effectiveness, taking more wickets in this series than any other in his career. His crucial breakthroughs and marathon spells have been instrumental for England, showcasing his resilience and re-establishing him as a primary bowling threat, not just a fourth seamer.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is "not a hoax" and called for "full transparency" to bring all involved individuals to justice. His comments contrast with President Trump's recent characterization of some supporters' intense focus on the case as a politically motivated scam. The remarks come as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to release more information from the Epstein investigation files. Johnson's stance highlights a division within the Republican party over how to handle the politically charged issue and the public's demand for more details.</p>

          <p>Multiple county clerks in Colorado have reported receiving unusual and legally questionable requests for third-party access to their voting equipment. The requests came from a political consultant who claimed to be working with the White House to implement an executive order on election security. Clerks, who are legally prohibited from allowing such unauthorized access, expressed shock and refused the requests, which they said set off alarm bells. The outreach, which targeted Republican clerks using Dominion Voting Systems, has raised concerns about a murky, unofficial effort to probe voting systems under the guise of federal authority.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis reveals that Tesla's decision to sell 75% of its bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 cost the company billions in potential profits. The company sold the digital assets when the crypto market was plunging, but bitcoin has since rebounded to near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its full investment, its holdings would be worth approximately $5 billion today, instead of the current $1.24 billion. While the company's digital assets still contributed $284 million to its second-quarter income, the missed opportunity highlights a significant financial misstep for the struggling automaker.

The author argues that while the settlement resolves a dispute over campus anti-Semitism and restores federal funding, it sets a dangerous precedent for government intervention in academic affairs. As part of the deal, Columbia agreed to measures aimed at ensuring ideological "balance" in its Middle East programs. The author warns this creates a roadmap for the government to pressure universities and purge perceived political adversaries from faculties nationwide.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are facing persistent questions from constituents about the Jeffrey Epstein case, even after returning to their home districts. The public's demand for transparency follows a Department of Justice memo that found no evidence of an Epstein "client list," a conclusion that has fueled further suspicion among some voters. The issue has created a rift within the GOP, with some members pushing for the full release of DOJ files while leadership resists. This article highlights how the complex and conspiracy-laden saga has become a grassroots political issue, complicating matters for representatives in competitive districts.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered numerous cases where automated license plate reader (ALPR) systems have led to wrongful and dangerous police stops. The technology, which uses AI to scan plates and check them against databases, can make errors due to glare, administrative mistakes, or software misinterpretations. These errors have resulted in innocent people, including children, being held at gunpoint after their vehicles were mistakenly flagged as stolen or associated with a crime. While law enforcement touts ALPRs as a vital crime-fighting tool, privacy advocates warn of the potential for abuse and civil rights violations.</p>
