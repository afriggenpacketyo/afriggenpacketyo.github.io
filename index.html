        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to claim significant cost savings, but a CBS News analysis suggests these figures are highly inflated. A review of three major contract cancellations, which DOGE claimed saved $6.4 billion, found the actual savings to be around $165 million, or less than 3% of the reported amount. Experts describe the agency's accounting as "transparency theater," noting that the claimed savings are based on unspent potential contract values, not actual obligated funds. The article also points to a study suggesting that related cuts to USAID could have a severe human toll.</p>

          <p>Hunter Biden has revealed he has started a new position as the director of development for BASTA, a nonprofit organization in southern Los Angeles focused on homeless prevention and tenants' rights. In a podcast interview, Biden stated the group is notable for representing undocumented immigrants as it does not accept federal funding. He emphasized the importance of preventing homelessness, particularly for families and children, to maintain their chances of a normal life. BASTA, founded in 2005, is known for its strategy of taking eviction defense cases to jury trials.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported a productive phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, focusing on sanctions against Russia and a major drone production agreement. Zelenskyy stated that Moscow is feeling the pressure from a deadline set by Trump for Russia to make peace or face harsher sanctions. He also mentioned that Ukraine is prepared to finalize what he called one of the strongest drone deals yet, as Kyiv increasingly relies on foreign investment to bolster its domestic defense industry. Separately, Trump has suggested that falling global energy prices could compel Russia to end the war.</p>

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation announced his arrest, and he now faces four counts of first-degree murder. The victims were identified as Cortney Rose, 38, her two children Adrianna Williams, 20, and Braydon Williams, 15, and Adrianna's partner, James Matthew Wilson, 21. The investigation began after an infant was found abandoned in a yard, leading authorities to discover the bodies of the four victims.</p>

          <p>As Americans live longer, many retirees are considering reverse mortgages to convert home equity into cash, but concerns exist about outliving the loan. This article explains that a homeowner cannot be forced out of their home as long as they reside there and meet obligations like paying taxes and insurance. However, it is possible to outlive the home's equity, as the loan balance grows with interest, potentially leaving no value for heirs. The structure of the payout, such as a line of credit versus a lump sum, can significantly impact how long the funds last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, demanding testimony regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein. The committee, led by Republican James Comer, also subpoenaed several former attorneys general and FBI directors from the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. The move follows bipartisan pressure to release more information after the Justice Department declined to make further details of the Epstein case public. The subpoenas seek information on the Clintons' past relationships with Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the former Romanian president who led the country through its turbulent transition from communism to democracy, has died at the age of 95. Iliescu served two terms as Romania's first freely elected president but remained a controversial figure due to his role in the violent 1989 revolution and the subsequent crackdown on student protests in 1990. He was charged with crimes against humanity in 2019 for his alleged involvement in the bloodshed of the revolution, but he was never convicted. He had largely withdrawn from public life in recent years due to declining health.</p>

          <p>Top-rated U.S. companies are increasingly using equity and cash to finance acquisitions this year, moving away from debt due to high borrowing costs and concerns over potential credit-rating downgrades. Bankers and investors note that with stock valuations high, financing deals with stock has become more compelling. This trend is evident in major deals like Union Pacific's planned acquisition of Norfolk Southern, which is expected to be funded mostly with stock. This shift could lead to lower-than-expected issuance volumes for investment-grade corporate bonds in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed in a CNBC interview that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two largest U.S. banks, had previously rejected him as a customer. Trump stated that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions of dollars and that Bank of America subsequently refused to open an account for him. He suggested the rejections were politically motivated due to pressure from regulators during the Biden administration. The allegations revive claims of financial institutions discriminating against conservative clients, an issue the Trump administration is reportedly preparing to address via executive order.</p>

          <p>Redwood Materials, a startup founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, is giving old electric vehicle batteries a second life by repurposing them to power AI data centers. As Redwood received more used EV batteries for recycling, it found that many still had significant usable capacity. The company is now using these batteries in microgrid projects, with its first major installation powering a massive data center in Texas. This innovative approach aims to provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for 24/7 renewable power to meet the skyrocketing energy demands of the AI industry.</p>

          <p>The government of Rwanda has agreed to accept up to 250 migrants from the United States under a new deal with the Trump administration. This arrangement is part of a broader U.S. deportation strategy that involves sending individuals to third countries. A Rwandan government spokesperson confirmed the agreement, stating that the nation would have the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement. This deal follows a previously cancelled plan between Rwanda and the U.K. and comes as human rights experts raise concerns about the legality of such third-country deportations.</p>

          <p>Following a significant downward revision of recent job growth numbers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, experts have clarified that such adjustments are a normal part of the reporting process. Former BLS Commissioner Erica Groshen described revisions as "a feature, not a bug," explaining that initial reports are based on incomplete survey data. As more businesses respond over time, the agency updates its estimates to be more precise. The recent large revision was attributed partly to late reporting from state and local governments, which are pulling back on hiring as pandemic-era subsidies expire. (not investment advice)</p>

The blaze, which is only 7% contained, is threatening more than 800 structures across Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and has forced evacuations and highway closures. At least three people have been injured, including a motorist who was overrun by flames and two contract employees whose vehicle overturned.

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation has exposed the operations of a violent Iraqi-Kurdish gang smuggling people across the English Channel. A reporter posing as a migrant gained access to the gang's forest hideout in northern France and documented their methods. The investigation also captured footage of the gang's associates collecting cash payments in Birmingham, UK, to secure places on the illegal crossings. The report identifies key leaders of the gang, which has changed its name multiple times to evade authorities, and details its involvement in deadly incidents and violent abuse of migrants.</p>
