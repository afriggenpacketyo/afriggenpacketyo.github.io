          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has reported third-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to strategic price increases and a greater focus on direct-to-consumer sales. The company successfully raised its gross margin despite higher tariff costs, with CEO Michelle Gass confirming that the price hikes have not negatively impacted consumer demand. As a result of its strong performance and successful strategies, including expanding its women's and non-denim categories, Levi's has raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. This indicates confidence in navigating ongoing macroeconomic volatility while maintaining brand value and consumer loyalty. (not investment advice)</p>

The attack, carried out by an assailant who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, resulted in the deaths of two individuals. The suspect was initially arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism and was re-arrested for failing to disclose information that could have been of material assistance in preventing the attack. He has since been released on bail, with authorities stating they do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal facilities and personnel involved in an aggressive immigration enforcement operation directed by the Trump administration. This move has been met with strong opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have filed a lawsuit to declare the deployment illegal and unconstitutional. The deployment is the latest in a series of similar actions in Democratic-led cities, escalating tensions between federal and local governments over immigration policy and the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement. A federal judge is currently weighing the legality of the operation.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia is reportedly considering whether to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges related to mortgage fraud. Sources confirmed that the potential charges stem from an ongoing investigation into her financial dealings. This development places a prominent Democratic official, known for her high-profile legal actions against Donald Trump and other major figures, under federal scrutiny. The details of the alleged fraud have not been made public, but the convening of a grand jury indicates that prosecutors believe there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a potential criminal case.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day in history after the luxury automaker released a disappointing financial outlook and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions. The company's shares plummeted over 15% as its updated revenue and earnings targets for 2030 fell short of analyst expectations. Ferrari also revised its 2030 vehicle lineup goal, reducing the share of fully electric cars from a planned 40% down to 20%, citing a client-centric approach and evolving market conditions. This move reflects a broader trend among global carmakers who are reassessing their EV strategies amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption and infrastructure challenges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a recent cabinet meeting, former President Donald Trump threatened to potentially halt all imports from China, highlighting the U.S. market's leverage over the Chinese economy. In the same discussion, however, he emphasized his desire to speak with President Xi Jinping to ensure that China continues purchasing U.S. soybeans, a key American export. This contradictory stance illustrates a complex and often conflicting approach to U.S.-China trade relations. Trump's comments underscore a strategy that combines aggressive protectionist threats with specific demands for agricultural trade, creating uncertainty in the global economic landscape.</p>

Co-CEO Greg Peters stated that the move aims to capture a share of the $140 billion global gaming market and provide more value to Netflix subscriptions.

          <p>The Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities is facing critical legal challenges in federal courts in Portland and Chicago.

The White House defends the deployments as necessary to protect federal property and personnel during immigration enforcement operations and protests. These court cases represent a significant test of presidential authority and the constitutional limits on deploying military forces within the United States.</p>

          <p>In his first solo directorial effort, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the career and personal struggles of mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The film delves into Kerr's rise to fame in the late '90s, his subsequent battle with painkiller addiction, and the decline of his winning streak, offering a gritty, character-driven alternative to traditional sports biopics. Safdie aimed to examine the vulnerability of a champion facing failure, a theme that attracted Johnson, who sought a role to challenge his heroic on-screen persona. The movie presents an uncomfortable yet humanizing portrait of an athlete confronting his own ego and limitations.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, former President Donald Trump has stated his administration's intention to permanently eliminate federal programs that are popular with Democrats. He framed the move as a way for Democrats to "get a little taste of their own medicine," blaming them for the funding stalemate. This threat follows earlier actions by the administration to freeze billions in funding for infrastructure and climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states and cities. The declaration escalates the political conflict, transforming the shutdown from a temporary funding dispute into an opportunity to enact long-term, partisan cuts to government services.</p>

With U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists furloughed, a critical program to release 400 captive-bred ferrets into the wild has been put on hold. According to wildlife experts, this delay is critical because the fall season is the essential window for the animals to adapt, hunt, and mate before winter. Halting the release not only threatens the fragile wild population of around 300 ferrets but also creates a bottleneck at the at-capacity breeding facility, potentially disrupting future conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>China has implemented new export controls on rare earth magnets and related technologies, requiring government approval for their export and tightening its grip on critical global supply chains. This op-ed argues that the move is part of a broader Chinese strategy of "lawfare," which uses legal and regulatory systems to assert geopolitical power and create advantages for its domestic industries. The article warns that U.S. companies are often unprepared for scenarios where complying with American law directly conflicts with Beijing's expanding legal regime. This strategy extends beyond export controls to include data security, antitrust, and sanctions laws to pressure foreign firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is proceeding with sending student loan forgiveness notices to eligible borrowers, even as a government shutdown continues. Borrowers in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan who have completed their required 20 or 25 years of payments are being notified that their debt discharge will be processed in the coming months. The action comes after the department had previously paused the relief to address court orders, sparking concern among borrowers who had fulfilled their obligations. This move ensures that long-term borrowers receive their promised debt cancellation, a key issue in ongoing debates over student loan policy.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has declared his opposition to the European Union's plan to phase out new internal combustion engine cars by 2035, stating he will do everything he can to prevent the "hard cutoff." Speaking at a summit with auto industry leaders, Merz and his coalition partners signaled a desire to revise the goal, potentially allowing for continued sales of plug-in hybrids and cars using innovative fuels. The move reflects growing concerns within Germany about the feasibility of the all-electric target and its impact on the nation's vital car industry, which is already facing significant economic and competitive pressures.</p>
