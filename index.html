          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, leading the company to raise its adjusted profit forecast for the fiscal year. The strong performance was driven by improvements in its retail pharmacy operations and its Aetna insurance division, which is navigating higher medical costs. In response to the positive results, company shares saw a significant jump in morning trading. CEO David Joyner highlighted the success of new technologies in pharmacy operations and a multi-year recovery effort at Aetna as key factors in the company's improved financial standing.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments concerning the legality of President Donald Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs. The case, closely watched by the administration, questions whether the president overstepped his constitutional powers by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to set a global tariff regime. Trump has defended the tariffs as crucial for national protection, while opponents, represented by lawyer Neal Katyal, argue that the power to set tariffs is explicitly granted to Congress. The outcome of this legal challenge could have significant implications for the future of U.S. trade policy and presidential authority.</p>

          <p>Former MMA fighter Conor McGregor has lost his appeal in a civil case where a jury found he had sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel in 2018. McGregor had been ordered to pay significant damages to the victim, Nikita Hand. His legal team's appeal centered on procedural issues, arguing that his "no comment" answers to police and the specific wording of a question for the jury were improperly handled during the trial. The appeals court ultimately rejected these grounds, upholding the original verdict and the financial penalty against him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are increasingly concerned about the global proliferation of counterfeit medications, a problem exacerbated by high demand for popular drugs like weight-loss treatments. The World Health Organization estimates that one in ten pharmaceutical products, particularly in lower-income countries, are fake, posing serious health risks. These counterfeit drugs are often sold through unregulated online pharmacies and can contain incorrect ingredients or no active ingredients at all. Regulatory bodies like the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency are running campaigns to raise consumer awareness and are coordinating with law enforcement to combat this dangerous trade.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of all spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission following a lengthy investigation by the Football Association. The Brazil international was accused in May of last year of deliberately receiving yellow cards in four separate Premier League matches to improperly influence betting markets. Paqueta, who faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty, was also cleared of two charges related to failing to cooperate with the investigation. The decision concludes a nearly two-year period of uncertainty for the 27-year-old player.</p>

          <p>Fishermen in Bangladesh face increasing danger in the Naf river, which borders Myanmar's conflict-ridden Rakhine state, due to the presence of the Arakan Army (AA) rebel group. The AA, which now controls much of the border region, has been abducting Bangladeshi fishermen, accusing them of crossing into their territory, creating fear and disrupting livelihoods for the local communities. Although Bangladesh's border guard has successfully rescued captured fishermen, the incidents highlight a complex geopolitical challenge for Dhaka. Analysts suggest that Bangladesh may need to engage pragmatically with the AA, now the de facto authority in the area, to ensure the safety of its citizens.</p>

However, Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds defended the government's plan, stating that the legal argument misses the broader objective of achieving a genuine peace process through a two-state solution.

Civil rights advocates and legal experts warn that the law allows for targeting individuals based on their national origin rather than their actions, bypassing due process.

The design is based on the physical principle of "superradiance," which would allow the weapon to generate extremely high-power microwave bursts with unprecedented firing speed and efficiency. According to computer simulations, the compact device could produce an initial pulse of 16.6 gigawatts, followed by a rapid-fire sequence of 10-gigawatt pulses. This technology represents a significant potential leap beyond the constraints that have traditionally limited high-power microwave systems, with applications in advanced warfare.</p>

The money is expected to expand detention and surveillance systems, potentially enriching private prison companies and tech firms with close ties to the administration.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there is no starvation in Gaza, creating a visible rift between the allies. Responding to images of hungry children, Trump stated, "you can’t fake that," and dispatched an envoy to the region to assess the humanitarian crisis. Administration officials suggest Trump believes Netanyahu may be prolonging the conflict for political reasons, contrary to U.S. wishes for an end to the war. Despite the disagreement and frustration, the White House has not signaled a major shift in U.S. policy and continues to blame Hamas for the breakdown in ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>A new NHS England report has identified significant failures in the care of Yusuf Nazir, a five-year-old boy who died from pneumonia and sepsis in 2022. The investigation found that the concerns of Yusuf's mother were repeatedly ignored by healthcare providers across multiple services, with a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight. The report detailed numerous missed opportunities to escalate his care before his condition became fatal. Yusuf's family is calling for a full inquest and demanding accountability, while the Health Secretary acknowledged the tragic failings and stressed the NHS's responsibility to implement the report's recommendations.</p>

The new laws also make permanent provisions allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans and make contributors eligible for the saver's credit.

Under the deal, South Korean goods will face a 15% tariff, which is lower than the previously threatened 25%, while U.S. exports to South Korea will be tariff-free. The agreement also includes a commitment from South Korea to facilitate $350 billion in U.S.-controlled investments and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. This deal is the latest in a series of agreements the administration has secured as it renegotiates trade relationships with countries around the world.</p>

          <p>A key inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve showed a price increase in June, with the annual rate reaching 2.6 percent. The Commerce Department report indicated that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, held steady at 2.8 percent. This uptick is partly attributed to President Trump's tariffs, which have elevated the costs of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and computers. The data provides context for the central bank's recent decision to maintain its current interest rate, as persistent inflation remains a key concern for economic stability.

The donor, who had used a sibling embryo to have her own daughter 30 years ago, found the couple through a Christian embryo adoption agency.

          <p>A large-scale study has found strong correlations between six distinct sleep traits and the risk of developing 172 different diseases. Researchers analyzed data from over 88,000 individuals and discovered that sleep rhythm, or the consistency of one's sleep-wake cycle, was the most significant factor, linked to nearly half of the diseases studied. For example, those with the most erratic sleep rhythms had a significantly higher risk of Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes. The findings, which emphasize sleep regularity over simple duration, suggest that a broader definition of good sleep is needed for public health.</p>

The talks aim to implement new bilateral guidelines on extended deterrence. Analysts suggest that a stronger U.S. nuclear commitment might reduce Japan's hesitation to support Taiwan's defense, a move that would likely be viewed negatively by Beijing and could escalate regional tensions.</p>
