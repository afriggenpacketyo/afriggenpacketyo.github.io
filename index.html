          <p>Qualcomm, a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, has collaborated with BMW to develop a cutting-edge automated driving system called Snapdragon Ride Pilot.  This system, initially launching on the BMW iX3 in 60 countries, allows for hands-free driving on specified roads and lane changes. Qualcomm's CEO anticipates a domino effect, with other automakers licensing the technology, given its street-proven performance and competitive edge. This diversification into the automotive sector is a key growth strategy for Qualcomm, aiming for substantial revenue increases in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals a record low in American business optimism regarding their five-year outlook in China.  Only 41% of surveyed firms expressed optimism, down significantly from 2021.  The leading factors contributing to this pessimism are the uncertain US-China relationship, intense competition from Chinese counterparts, and China's economic slowdown. This decline reflects a broader trend of global investor pullback from China, marked by a decrease in foreign direct investment in the first seven months of the year.</p>

This restructuring aims to streamline operations, accelerate decision-making, and reallocate resources toward growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity treatment.  The job cuts will result in a significant one-time cost, and the company has revised its full-year operating profit growth forecast downwards as a consequence.</p>

          <p>The European Union's 2035 ban on new gasoline and diesel cars is facing renewed scrutiny. While EV manufacturers and related industries support the ban, emphasizing the substantial investments already made,  auto industry associations and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz express concerns about its feasibility and impact on competitiveness.  This disagreement highlights the complex challenges faced by Europe's auto sector, including rising costs, tariffs, and supply chain issues.  Upcoming talks between automakers and the European Commission will address these concerns and the future of the 2035 regulation.</p>
