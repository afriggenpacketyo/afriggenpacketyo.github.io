        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations. The shortfall was primarily driven by a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales for both KFC and Pizza Hut, indicating significant domestic struggles. While Taco Bell continued to perform well with a 4% sales growth, the challenges at the other major chains highlight increased competition and shifting consumer dining habits. Globally, Yum's same-store sales saw a modest 2% increase, largely supported by KFC's international performance, particularly in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm nearly £46 million over the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The FCA determined that Woodford and his company made inappropriate investment decisions, prioritizing illiquid assets, which left the fund unable to meet redemption requests from its 300,000 investors. Woodford himself faces a personal fine of almost £6 million and a ban from senior management roles. Both Woodford and his firm are appealing the decision, which alleges they failed to act appropriately as the fund's value and liquidity declined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA is accelerating plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 to support a permanent human presence and a future lunar economy. The move is seen as a response to similar ambitions from China and Russia, raising concerns that the new space race is driven by geopolitics rather than scientific collaboration. While scientists agree that nuclear power is likely the only viable option for continuous energy on the Moon, given its two-week-long nights, the ambitious timeline is questioned amid recent NASA budget cuts. The project also faces logistical and safety hurdles, including launching radioactive materials through Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County grand jury has declined to indict former Atlanta police officer Kiran Kimbrough in the 2023 death of 62-year-old church deacon Johnny Hollman Sr. Hollman died after a struggle with the officer following a minor car accident, during which he was tased after refusing to sign a citation. Body camera footage showed Hollman repeatedly saying, "I can't breathe." Despite an autopsy ruling the death a homicide, the grand jury rejected charges of manslaughter and battery. The decision has been met with devastation by Hollman's family, who recently settled a $3.8 million lawsuit with the city over the incident.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a limited injunction against a new Arkansas law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms and libraries. The ruling applies only to four school districts where families filed a lawsuit, arguing the law violates the constitutional separation of church and state. U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks described the law as part of a "coordinated strategy" by several Republican-led states to inject Christian doctrine into public schools. While the decision is a victory for civil liberties groups, the law remains in effect for most of the state's districts as similar legal battles unfold in Texas and Louisiana.</p>

The lawsuit argues the decision to freeze the funds, mandated by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers and an "arbitrary and capricious" act. The program was designed to help nearly 350 disadvantaged communities address environmental hazards like pollution, lead pipes, and flooding. The plaintiffs are seeking a preliminary injunction to force the EPA to immediately reinstate the program and release the funds.</p>

Health officials are urging residents and workers in the affected zip codes with flu-like symptoms to seek immediate medical attention, especially those over 50 or with compromised immune systems. The disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria found in warm water systems, is not contagious between people and can be treated with antibiotics. The NYC Health Department has completed remediation of 11 cooling towers that initially tested positive for the bacteria as it continues to investigate the source of the cluster.</p>

          <p>The sentencing of Bryan Kohberger for the murders of four University of Idaho students has reignited public and philosophical debate about the concept of evil. Kohberger received four life sentences without parole but offered no motive, leading the judge to describe the crime as a senseless act of evil. This article contrasts his case with that of the 1966 Texas tower sniper, whose autopsy revealed a brain tumor, complicating moral judgment. The author, Amanda Knox, argues that labeling acts as "evil" is a way to stop thinking critically about the complex roots of violence, which can stem from neurological, genetic, and environmental factors beyond an individual's control.</p>

However, the move drew sharp criticism from both urban and rural school districts, as well as Republican senators from states that heavily rely on the funding.

The induced hunger crisis has alienated key allies, with countries like the UK and Canada now supporting Palestinian statehood, and has eroded support within the United States. The policy, intended to pressure Hamas, instead handed the group leverage by forcing Israel to unilaterally pause military operations to allow aid.

          <p>Jay Blades, the well-known host of the BBC program "The Repair Shop," has been charged with two counts of sexual assault, according to West Mercia Police. The 55-year-old television presenter is scheduled to appear in court on August 13 to face the allegations. This development comes as Blades is also facing a separate, unrelated charge of controlling or coercive behavior, which he has denied. Blades, who received an MBE in 2021, became a prominent figure in British television after his show's success but stepped back from his presenting duties last year.</p>

          <p>China's beleaguered property market is showing potential signs of stabilization, leading some analysts to believe the downturn may be nearing its end. Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast for the decline in new home sales this year from 15% to 7%, citing a better-than-expected first half. Key factors contributing to this more optimistic outlook include the resumption of credit flows to developers and a reduction in the national inventory of unsold homes. Additionally, the market has seen significant consolidation, with the top 15 state-owned developers increasing their market share, which is seen as a stabilizing influence on the sector.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global tensions rise, the decades-old maxim that "a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought" is being challenged by the strategic actions of world powers. The US, Russia, and China are all modernizing their arsenals and developing doctrines for so-called "limited" nuclear conflicts, suggesting a belief that such wars could be fought and won without escalating to global annihilation. Proponents argue that preparing for limited nuclear war is necessary for deterrence, while critics warn that this thinking makes the use of nuclear weapons more likely and dangerously underestimates the risk of uncontrollable escalation. This debate is becoming more urgent in an era of renewed superpower competition.</p>

          <p>Despite international airdrops of aid into Gaza, humanitarian organizations and local Palestinians report that the measures are failing to address the severe hunger crisis. The aid is described as insufficient, poorly distributed, and dangerous, with one recent death reported from a falling pallet. The UN has stated that land deliveries are far more effective and less costly, and is calling on Israel to fully open border crossings. The UN-backed IPC warns that a worst-case famine scenario is unfolding, as Gaza's 2.2 million residents face critical shortages after Israel cut off most supplies in March to pressure Hamas.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing the personal information of crime suspects, including immigration status and ethnicity, "needs to change." Her comments follow a controversy where Warwickshire Police declined to release such details about two men arrested for the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. Cooper said the government wants to see greater transparency to provide local communities with more information and has asked the Law Commission to accelerate its review of the rules. The issue touches on a sensitive balance between public information, preventing misinformation, and ensuring a fair trial.</p>

The policy is part of the Trump administration's broader agenda to tighten immigration controls.

The state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate the implant, while state lawyers contend the lethal injection protocol will not trigger the device.

Reich contends that this politicization destroys the BLS's status as a trusted, independent source of economic information, comparing it to a move from George Orwell's "1984."

Senior administrators stated they are preparing to discuss what information federal agencies need to lift the suspensions, though the terms of negotiation remain unclear. The move has prompted an outcry from faculty, who are petitioning the University of California system to challenge what they call the administration's illegitimate and malicious demands.</p>
