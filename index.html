          <p>The jury in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial in New York has reached a verdict on four of the five counts against him but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. After two days of deliberation, jurors informed the judge they were unable to come to a unanimous decision on the racketeering count, which carries a potential life sentence. The judge has instructed the jury to continue deliberating in an effort to break the impasse. The partial verdicts on the other four charges, which include sex trafficking and prostitution-related offenses, have not yet been publicly revealed.</p>

          <p>Australian airline Qantas is alerting customers to a significant data breach after its third-party customer service platform was targeted by a cyber attack. The breach, detected on June 30, may have exposed the personal information of up to six million people, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and frequent flyer details. Qantas has assured customers that more sensitive data like passport details and credit card information were not stored on the compromised system. The airline has notified Australian federal police and cybersecurity authorities and has apologized for the incident, which adds to a growing list of major data breaches in Australia.</p>

This move reflects growing concerns in Taipei about the need for both military readiness and civilian preparedness in the event of a prolonged conflict.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has experienced a significant political setback, being forced into a humiliating U-turn on its proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) welfare program. Facing a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs, Starmer had to abandon the planned reforms, leading to chaotic scenes in the House of Commons. The episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority, exposed deep divisions within his party, and fueled speculation about inevitable tax rises in the autumn budget. The turmoil has left the government appearing out of control despite its large majority, drawing comparisons to more unstable previous administrations.</p>

Tribal leaders express serious concerns about the facility's potential environmental impact on the Big Cypress National Preserve, noting the lack of any recent environmental studies. They also highlight safety risks, as tribal villages and schools are situated just 900 feet from the entrance. President Trump, who toured the remote site, described the surrounding swamp and wildlife as a natural deterrent for the up to 5,000 migrants it could hold.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled expiration. The Department of Homeland Security, under Secretary Kristi Noem, had moved to terminate the program on September 2, but the judge ruled this action was unlawful as it did not follow the congressionally mandated process. The court found that the interests of the Haitian TPS holders, who can legally live and work in the U.S., far outweigh potential harm to the government. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for Haitians amid ongoing gang violence and instability in their home country.</p>

The dispute centers on the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and EV tax credits. These cuts could negatively impact Tesla's sales and its energy division. In response, President Trump suggested Musk could lose more than just his "EV mandate," alluding to the billions in federal contracts and subsidies his companies like SpaceX and Tesla have received.

However, attorneys for the abuse survivors have condemned the filing as a delay tactic designed to help the church evade accountability and justice.

          <p>A massive spending bill approved by the Senate includes potential cuts of $930 billion to Medicaid over the next decade, causing significant concern for the millions of nursing home residents who rely on the program. In states like West Virginia, over 77% of nursing home residents depend on Medicaid, and facility operators warn that such drastic cuts could lead to reduced staffing and services. The proposed funding reduction highlights a major point of contention in the bill, with critics, including some Republican state senators, arguing that the budget should not be balanced on the backs of the nation's most vulnerable elderly population.</p>

With shrapnel injuries now accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma, these tools allow for minimally invasive procedures, even on delicate organs like the heart. Developed by a volunteer-led initiative, the modernized magnets are more precise and powerful than historical counterparts, reducing surgery time and risk. Over 3,000 units have been distributed to hospitals and field medics, representing a significant advancement in warzone medical care born from necessity.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration formally shuts down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a new study in The Lancet medical journal estimates the move could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The research found that USAID programs, which the administration has criticized as wasteful, have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades by funding initiatives from HIV medication to child nutrition. The study analyzed data from 133 countries and found that high levels of USAID funding were associated with a 15% reduction in overall mortality, highlighting the profound human cost of eliminating U.S. foreign aid.</p>

          <p>An official drought has been declared in northwest England and Yorkshire, with other regions at risk if dry conditions persist. The UK experienced its sixth driest spring on record, leading to significantly low levels in rivers and reservoirs, which are crucial for water supplies. In England, combined reservoir levels are at their lowest for this time of year in over 30 years. The dry weather is already impacting farmers, who face higher costs for irrigation, and wildlife habitats. Long-term forecasts suggest the dry spell may continue, increasing pressure on water resources and raising concerns about the broader effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in decades, a move aimed at spurring housing development. Pushed through by Governor Gavin Newsom as part of the state budget, the new legislation waives CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas. This eliminates a tool that project opponents, including neighborhood groups and labor unions, have long used to delay or block construction through lengthy studies and lawsuits. The change signals a major political shift, prioritizing housing abundance over the procedural hurdles that have stifled building in the state.</p>
