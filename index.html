          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has garnered international praise for her adept handling of relations with President Trump, earning her titles like "Trump whisperer." Despite these diplomatic successes, Sheinbaum faces significant domestic challenges, including economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs and persistent security issues with cartels controlling vast territories. The ongoing crisis of disappearances, with thousands missing under her presidency, poses a major threat to her high approval ratings. Sheinbaum also faces a controversial judicial election that could consolidate power within her party, raising concerns about Mexico's democratic future.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has emerged as a significant challenger to Britain's established two-party system following substantial gains in recent local elections. The party's success, coupled with gains by other smaller parties, has shaken the traditional dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. Political analysts suggest that Reform U.K.'s surge in support reflects a broader fragmentation of society and growing disenchantment with the main political forces. Prime Minister Keir Starmer now faces the challenge of appealing to Reform U.K.'s sympathizers without alienating Labour's progressive base, while the Conservatives grapple with recapturing voters drawn to Farage's party.</p>

Port Sudan, the de-facto capital of Sudan's military-led government, had previously been considered one of the safest places in the war-ravaged nation.

          <p>Across Africa, local traders are increasingly using China’s yuan instead of the US dollar for international transactions, creating informal payment networks. In commercial hubs like Nairobi’s Eastleigh market, logistics companies facilitate Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversions, allowing traders to pay in local currency while handling yuan payments to Chinese sellers. This trend is driven by a desire to bypass the U.S. dollar and engage directly with China's economy. As trade between Africa and China grows, the yuan is becoming a more prominent currency in local markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies are facing increased scrutiny as the economy falters and his approval ratings decline, signaling a shift in political momentum.

The administration's immigration policies and cuts to social security and development programs have also drawn criticism. As opposition grows and Republicans eye the upcoming midterm elections, Trump's grip on power appears less secure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times detailed its methodology for testing soil in Altadena and Pacific Palisades following wildfires, collecting 40 samples from residential properties, including those where debris removal was completed and standing homes.

Samples were tested for 17 metals, and the results revealed contamination above state health-based cleanup goals in some areas.

          <p>President Trump's global policies played a role in Australia's election, contributing to the re-election of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil caused by Trump's policies, especially tariffs, influenced voters concerned about the cost of living. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, faced criticism for echoing some of Trump's rhetoric. Voters rejected Dutton's approach, solidifying a victory for sensible, centrist politics and sensible policies.</p>
