          <p>A technology executive with connections to the Chinese Communist Party received VIP treatment at a Trump crypto dinner, highlighting inconsistencies in the administration's approach to visitors from China. The executive's purchases of the president's digital coin earned him a tour of the White House. This incident underscores the complex dynamics between political access, financial transactions, and international relations within the Trump administration. The event raises questions about the criteria used for granting special access and the potential influence of foreign entities on domestic policy.

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have surged as police intensify efforts to target employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people in the past year during raids at businesses. These businesses often subject migrants to poor conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages. The government aims to crack down on illegal migration by tightening work visas and addressing overstaying. </p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for U.S. colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars.

The agreement marks a significant shift in college sports, allowing athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL).

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly mused about creating a new political party, potentially escalating his feud with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it's time to create a new political party in America that represents the 80% in the middle. Musk endorsed the name "America Party" for the potential new party. The move could signal Musk's intention to challenge Trump's influence. </p>

          <p>The return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, raises questions about President Trump's views of justice. The Justice Department secured an indictment against Abrego Garcia after repeatedly flouting court orders to facilitate his release from El Salvador. The case highlights concerns about due process and the administration's approach to immigration enforcement. The legal proceedings will determine the validity of the charges against Abrego Garcia. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He has been accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy. El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer called the charges "preposterous". </p>
