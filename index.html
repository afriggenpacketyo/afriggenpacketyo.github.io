          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 10:30:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. This decision concludes a decade-long legal battle, with the traders arguing their actions were common practice and known to superiors, making them scapegoats for a wider industry issue. The ruling may open the door for other convicted traders to appeal and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new feature in the U.S. that allows women and non-binary drivers and riders to indicate a preference for being matched with each other. The pilot program, called "Women+ Connect," will begin next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. While not a guarantee, the feature is designed to increase the likelihood of women-to-women pairings, aiming to enhance comfort and safety on the platform. This initiative builds on a similar feature previously rolled out in about 40 other countries and comes as the company continues to address long-standing safety concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam, has issued a stark warning of "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to Israel's siege and restrictions on humanitarian access. The joint statement highlights record rates of acute malnutrition, particularly among children, with some telling their parents they wish to go to heaven for food. The World Health Organization reports over 70 child deaths from malnutrition this year. In response, an Israeli government spokesperson denied the existence of a famine, blaming Hamas for engineering the food shortage by disrupting aid distribution.</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights office stated that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians attempting to access food aid in the Gaza Strip since May. The majority of these deaths reportedly occurred near distribution sites run by an American contractor. This comes amid a deepening humanitarian crisis, with experts warning of famine conditions and the Gaza Health Ministry reporting 80 child deaths from starvation since the war began. A joint statement from 28 Western-aligned nations condemned the aid delivery model as dangerous and inhumane, while Israel blamed the chaos on Hamas and widespread looting.</p>

          <p>Essex Police have refuted claims that they transported pro-refugee protesters to a demonstration outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping. The force called the allegations "categorically wrong," explaining they provided a police cordon for safety and later escorted some individuals away from the volatile scene by vehicle. The protests, which saw clashes between rival groups, resulted in injuries to police officers and hotel staff, leading to ten arrests. The demonstrations were sparked after an asylum seeker residing at the hotel was charged with sexual offenses, which he denies, fueling local tensions.</p>

In Soviet times, it drew massive, reverent crowds, a phenomenon that faded after the USSR's collapse. The renewed interest appears driven less by political nostalgia and more by a desire for a final look at the historical curiosity, amid ongoing debates about whether Lenin should finally be buried.</p>

Its rediscovery has brought relief to conservationists who feared it was extinct.

Despite the slowdown in sales, the median home price hit a new record high for June at $435,300, marking the 24th consecutive month of annual price increases. According to the National Association of Realtors, this sustained price growth is driven by a persistent undersupply of housing inventory relative to population growth. The market remains tilted towards sellers, with all-cash deals and high-end property sales remaining strong components of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Other options include debt consolidation through personal loans or balance transfer credit cards, which can lower interest rates for those with good credit. For individuals facing more severe struggles, nonprofit credit counseling agencies can arrange debt management plans to negotiate better terms, while debt settlement and bankruptcy remain options for extreme situations.

Despite a ban on mass gatherings, thousands protested in Kyiv and other cities, viewing the move as a betrayal of the democratic principles many are fighting for. The law is seen by critics, including EU officials, as a step backward for Ukraine's anti-graft efforts and its aspirations to join the European Union. Zelenskyy defended the law, claiming it was necessary to remove Russian influence from the agencies and speed up investigations.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby wing Harry Potter has labeled criticism from former coach Sir Clive Woodward and Wallabies legend David Campese as "ridiculous." The pair had accused the Australian team of having a "losing mentality" after their captain kicked the ball out to end the first Test match against the British and Irish Lions while trailing 27-19. Woodward and Campese argued the team should have played on for pride, but Potter insisted the squad's intention was to win. Following the loss in Brisbane, Australia must win the second Test in Melbourne to keep the series alive.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's public pressure on the Federal Reserve suggests his attempts to force lower interest rates could have the opposite effect. While Trump desires rate cuts to boost the economy, threatening the central bank's independence could spook investors, who might demand higher returns on U.S. government bonds to compensate for inflation and instability risks. This would perversely drive up long-term interest rates for mortgages and car loans. Economists argue that if the Fed were to cut rates dramatically in the current inflationary environment, it would signal a loss of credibility, potentially destabilizing the economy.

Analysts attribute this decline partly to a drop in orders for oil and LNG tankers, as shipowners are reportedly cautious due to the United States' prominent role in energy exports and potential trade frictions.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists claims to have developed a new aircraft design platform that breaks the "curse of dimensionality," a long-standing challenge in aviation engineering. The software reportedly allows for a vast number of design variables without increasing the computational load, enabling simultaneous optimization of competing factors like stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion. To illustrate its power, the researchers applied it to the design of the canceled U.S. Navy X-47B drone, showing it could deliver dramatic improvements.

          <p>A 2025 Bankrate study has named New Hampshire the best U.S. state to retire in, challenging the traditional focus on warm climates. The ranking, which weighed factors based on what Americans prioritize, placed the most importance on affordability, weather, and neighborhood safety. While New Hampshire ranked poorly for weather, it was number one for safety and in the top ten for healthcare and tax-friendliness. Notably, no Sun Belt states like Florida or Arizona made the top ten, as high rankings in categories like safety and healthcare in several New England states offset their less favorable weather and higher costs.</p>

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and integrating them into its own body to perform photosynthesis. This process, known as kleptoplasty, allows the slug to sustain itself on light like a plant, blurring the lines between animal and plant kingdoms. The phenomenon is a striking example of symbiosis, where organisms co-opt traits from others, a mechanism some biologists believe is a more significant driver of evolution than traditionally thought. While the exact genetic mechanics remain a mystery, the slug highlights how permeable the boundaries between species and their environments can be.</p>

By securing a deal that sets a 15% tariff rate and a commitment for $550 billion in Japanese investment in the U.S., the administration can claim its hardball tactics are yielding results. The agreement with a major economic power like Japan could serve as a model or a warning to other trading partners, including the European Union. However, economists note that U.S. consumers will likely bear much of the cost of these tariffs through higher prices for imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>
