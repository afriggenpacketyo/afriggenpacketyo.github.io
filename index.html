            <p>Max Verstappen refused to comment on the penalty he received during the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, though his radio messages indicated disapproval. Red Bull's team principal considered the penalty harsh, questioning the abandonment of 'let them race' principles. Stewards clarified the penalty was reduced due to it being the first lap, but emphasized Piastri had earned the corner, with McLaren's team principal agreeing that Piastri had a right to the corner. Verstappen served the penalty and Piastri won the race with a move around the outside of Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari.</p>

Their comments came amid concerns about Trump's tariffs and potential recession fears. Rogan highlighted a perception that there may not be a grand plan behind Trump's actions, contrasting with assumptions of strategic intent. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old US citizen from New Mexico, was wrongfully detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days. Border patrol officials claimed Hermosillo admitted to entering the US illegally from Mexico, despite his claims of being a US citizen. His family provided his birth certificate and social security card, leading to his release after a federal judge dismissed his case. The incident is part of a rising number of US citizens detained by immigration officials.</p>

            <p>The Texas House approved a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition, after nearly 11 hours of debate. The bill will provide $10,000 annually for students attending private schools, with additional funds for disabled and home-schooled students. Democrats expressed disappointment, calling the bill "welfare for the rich" and voicing concerns about its impact on public school funding. President Trump expressed his support for the bill.</p>

Klobuchar suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for Ábrego García's deportation or refusal to facilitate his return. Her comments followed Justice Samuel Alito's dissenting opinion on a Supreme Court decision to block deportations of Venezuelans.</p>
