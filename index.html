          <p>The Trump administration is currently engaged in a dispute with Harvard University following the school's refusal to comply with the administration's demands. Meanwhile, the White House is defending Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who is accused of using a second group chat on Signal to leak details about a potential U.S. strike against Houthis in Yemen. The administration is also dealing with the legal battle surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

          <p>Austrian central bank chief Robert Holzmann suggested that euro zone interest rates should be maintained until there is greater clarity regarding the trajectory of U.S. tariffs and potential European Union countermeasures. Holzmann, a known hawk on the European Central Bank, said that the ECB made the decision to cut rates at its April meeting with caution and had seen a need to wait for more data. He told CNBC that there was a "broad consensus" around lowering rates, but some disagreement at the margins.</p>

          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecast to zero, attributing the stagnation to the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. Economy Minister Robert Habeck stated that Trump's tariffs are disproportionately impacting Germany's export-oriented economy. The tariffs, including a blanket 10% duty on all imports and 25% levies on cars, aluminum, and steel, are expected to significantly affect Germany's automotive and pharmaceutical industries. The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, has also warned of a potential "slight recession" in 2025.</p>
