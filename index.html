          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested nearly 500 individuals during a pro-Palestine Action protest in central London, which proceeded despite official calls for postponement after a Manchester synagogue attack. Organizers, Defend Our Juries, asserted around 1,000 participants supported Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the government in July. The bulk of arrests occurred for gathering in Trafalgar Square, with some for unfurling banners on Westminster Bridge, requiring officers to physically remove uncooperative protesters. Human rights groups criticized the arrests, while the Community Security Trust deemed the protests "phenomenally tone deaf" given recent events.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy battered large parts of the UK with heavy rain and strong winds, leading to widespread damage and disruption. Thousands of homes across Scotland and Northern Ireland suffered power outages, while numerous railway lines, roads, and ferry services were closed due to gusts exceeding 100mph. The storm also set a new October record for the deepest area of low pressure in the UK. Tragically, a man died in the Republic of Ireland in a weather-related incident, underscoring the severe and dangerous conditions.</p>

Pundits and former players, including Wayne Rooney and Pat Nevin, lauded the 18-year-old as a "special talent" with immense potential. This debut goal, following an impressive substitute appearance, suggests Estevao is quickly settling into English football and ready to deliver significant moments for Chelsea.</p>

Despite head coach Derek McInnes' cautious stance against premature title talk, the team's strong performance, fueled by a £10m investment, has generated significant optimism. With traditional rivals Rangers in turmoil and Celtic yet to hit top gear, supporters are encouraged to embrace the excitement, even as some recall past collapses by other strong starters.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker strongly condemned the Trump administration's plan to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members for deployment in Chicago, despite his repeated rejections. Pritzker stated he was given an ultimatum to deploy troops or face federal intervention, calling the move "outrageous and un-American." This decision follows clashes between protesters and federal agents during ICE operations in Broadview, including a shooting incident. The governor views the deployment as a "manufactured performance" aimed at control, not public safety, exacerbating tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

The party plans to rebrand and double funding for a "Removals Force," aiming to remove 150,000 people annually. This strategy, inspired by US policies under Trump, also involves restricting asylum grounds and potentially leaving the European Convention on Human Rights to bypass legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a landmark moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, 53, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton for a six-year term, marking a significant step in the ELCA's efforts to invest in diversity and multicultural ministries. His election is seen as an inspiration for others from underrepresented communities. Curry, a former social worker and teacher, plans to focus on making the ELCA a more connected, welcoming, and thriving church, addressing challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations.</p>

          <p>Democrats are actively refuting Republican claims that their funding resolution would provide "free healthcare for illegals," labeling them as misleading "lies" during the government shutdown debate. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries clarified that federal law prohibits such provisions and Democrats are not seeking to change it. Republicans, including Vice President J.D. Vance, have used this narrative to frame the debate, shifting focus from cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies that impact lawfully present noncitizens. This article highlights the intense political misinformation surrounding healthcare and immigration, complicating legislative efforts.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to make popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy available to its members at approximately half their usual cost. Through the store's prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, an offer exclusively for those paying out-of-pocket, as many insurers don't cover these drugs. This move by Costco aims to boost access and demand for semaglutide, a medication that helps regulate appetite, amid soaring prices and limited supply, and increasing public interest in these treatments.</p>
