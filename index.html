          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was killed by a large shark off a popular Sydney beach while with friends. The attack resulted in the loss of multiple limbs, and despite efforts by fellow surfers to bring him to shore, resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful. This incident marks Sydney's first fatal shark attack since 2022, prompting the temporary closure of nearby beaches as authorities work to identify the species involved. The event has drawn attention to the rare but tragic nature of such encounters in the region.</p>

          <p>German political figures are addressing several pressing national issues, from student well-being to foreign policy and economic strategy. The Federal Student Conference has highlighted a significant mental health crisis among young people, calling for major investment in schools.

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and presenter Matt Tebbutt will replace Gregg Wallace as a judge on "MasterChef: The Professionals." Tebbutt, known for hosting "Saturday Kitchen," will join Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. Wallace was dismissed in July after an independent inquiry upheld numerous allegations of misconduct, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. The report also substantiated a claim of racist language used against fellow host John Torode, who was also let go from the main series.</p>

          <p>China is planning a "kinetic impact demonstration mission" to test its capabilities in defending Earth from potential asteroid threats. Wu Weiren, chief designer of the country's lunar exploration program, revealed the plan aims to target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. The mission, which could launch within the year, will utilize both an impactor and an observer spacecraft to measure the resulting orbital deflection. This initiative underscores China's growing ambitions in deep space exploration and planetary defense strategies.</p>

          <p>In a remote area of Sudan's Darfur region, villagers are using their bare hands to search for victims buried by a catastrophic landslide. Aid group Save the Children reports scenes of devastation, with estimates of the death toll varying widely but potentially reaching 1,000, including 200 children. Rescue and aid efforts are severely hampered by the area's remoteness and the ongoing civil war. This tragedy compounds an already massive humanitarian crisis that has displaced millions across the country and strained all available resources.</p>

Eygi was killed while attending a protest against settlement expansion. An Israeli military inquiry concluded the shooting was unintentional, a finding disputed by a Washington Post investigation.

The event's schedule has raised questions about the diminishing distinctions between the mainstream Republican party and ultra-nationalist movements. Speakers included Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt and members of Donald Trump's administration, sharing a platform with individuals associated with white nationalist authors and secretive, men-only ultranationalist groups.

          <p>With gold prices hitting new records and gaining over 35% this year, many investors are looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are considered more liquid and cost-effective than owning physical gold. While seen as a hedge against volatility, advisors generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically under 3%. (not investment advice)</p>

A trail of evidence, including a blood-stained rope, a shell casing, and broken acrylic nails matched to Jimenez, was crucial in securing the conviction.

          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic is causing a noticeable shift in consumer spending, posing a new challenge for the snack and processed food industries. Research shows that users of these weight-loss medications reduce their overall grocery spending and purchase fewer ultra-processed foods. This trend is prompting retailers to adapt by offering higher-protein ready-meals and more fresh produce. While the high cost of the drugs currently limits a mass market shift, the changing habits of users are already beginning to impact food industry strategies.</p>

          <p>New Trump administration policies are causing widespread confusion and making it difficult for many Americans, including vulnerable seniors, to receive COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA has restricted its approval of the latest shot to those 65 and older or with underlying health conditions, forcing many to get a prescription. This has led to pharmacies in some states denying vaccinations to eligible individuals who lack a prescription, creating frustration amid a summer spike in cases. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of clear recommendations from the CDC.</p>

          <p>In response to recent changes in federal vaccine policy, several states are creating their own guidance to ensure public access to COVID-19 shots. New York has declared a disaster emergency, while states like Massachusetts and New Mexico are taking actions to maintain vaccine availability. A new West Coast Health Alliance, including California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, has formed to coordinate evidence-based recommendations. State leaders express concern over staff cuts at federal agencies and recent FDA restrictions on fall COVID shots, prompting them to seek alternative, science-based sources.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Health and Human Services department is reportedly planning to release a report linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism. The medical and scientific communities have strongly criticized this anticipated conclusion, stating there is no credible evidence to support such a claim. Organizations like the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reiterate that acetaminophen is safe and recommended for treating fever and pain in pregnancy. Experts emphasize that autism's causes are complex and that linking it to a single factor is misleading and unscientific.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the removal of the White House Peace Vigil, a protest site that has been continuously maintained across from the White House since 1981. After a reporter from a conservative outlet described the vigil's tent as an "eyesore," Trump responded by directing that it be taken down immediately. The 44-year-old vigil, which calls for global disarmament, is one of the longest-running protests in the world. Its potential removal represents the end of a historic symbol of peaceful dissent in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken an approximately 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the U.S. government its largest single shareholder. This move, converting previous grants into equity, aims to strengthen domestic production of cutting-edge microchips to compete with China and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. While government ownership stakes in private companies are rare in the U.S., this action is framed as a strategic necessity for national security and technological leadership in AI.

          <p>In India's traffic-congested cities like Mumbai, drivers are increasingly replacing standard-issue vehicle horns with much louder, often illegal, air-pressure horns. Many drivers believe louder horns are necessary to navigate chaotic roads, contributing to severe noise pollution that often exceeds 80 decibels, well above WHO recommendations. This trend is driven by a perception that standard horns are inadequate, leading to a thriving market for aftermarket horns. The escalating noise levels pose a significant and growing public health issue for urban residents.</p>

The article suggests that organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) could play a pivotal role in creating new monetary and trade institutions.

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Japan's Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years.

With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the future of the world's oldest continuous monarchy is uncertain.
