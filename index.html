          <p>This article explores the factors behind the extraordinary success of England women's football manager Sarina Wiegman, who has led teams to five consecutive major tournament finals. Described by players as calm, direct, and caring, her leadership combines tactical ruthlessness with a strong focus on the human side of management, creating a resilient and motivated squad. Wiegman's ability to handle pressure, make difficult decisions, and foster a deep sense of team unity are highlighted as key elements of her winning formula heading into the Euro 2025 final.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official in Jilin province has called for a more assertive presentation of China's history regarding ancient kingdoms that existed in northeastern China and the Korean peninsula. This move touches on the contested history of the Goguryeo, Buyeo, and Balhae kingdoms, which both nations claim as part of their heritage. The emphasis on a Chinese narrative risks reviving historical sensitivities and creating diplomatic friction with South Korea.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing information about deadly mass attacks, such as recent incidents where cars struck pedestrians near schools. Official reports are often minimal and scrubbed from the internet, a policy that has intensified since a particularly deadly attack in November. This growing censorship is prompting some citizens to push back online, demanding transparency and questioning the authorities' motives for withholding information from the public.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees star Aaron Judge has been placed on the 10-day injured list with a right elbow flexor strain, but an MRI revealed no acute ligament damage, bringing relief to the team and its fans. The injury, which affects his throwing but not his hitting, will sideline him for an estimated 10 to 14 days. Judge hopes to return quickly, initially serving as the designated hitter once he is cleared to play.</p>
