        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles following discussions with King Charles III. The decision comes amid renewed scrutiny of his connection to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations made by Virginia Giuffre. In a statement from Buckingham Palace, the prince maintained his vigorous denial of the allegations against him but stated that the continued controversy was a distraction from the work of the Royal Family. This move is seen as an attempt to distance the monarchy from the damaging scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to pause over $11 billion in projects due to the ongoing government shutdown. Budget chief Russell Vought stated the funding lapse has drained the agency's ability to manage these "lower-priority" projects in cities like New York and San Francisco. The Trump administration has framed these funding pauses and potential cancellations as a direct consequence of the shutdown, which they attribute to Democrats. This action is part of a series of funding freezes impacting infrastructure and climate-related initiatives.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 14:52:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent series of significant loan losses at regional banks has heightened investor anxiety about exposure to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). The issue gained prominence after Zions bank disclosed a near-total loss on a $60 million loan, followed by a similar situation at Western Alliance, sparking a selloff in regional bank stocks. This has drawn attention to the rapidly growing $1.14 trillion market of bank lending to non-bank entities, a practice that surged after post-2008 regulations shifted riskier lending outside the traditional banking system. Analysts note the opacity of these loan books and the potential for sudden, severe losses are spooking the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold has reached an unprecedented high, surpassing $4,300 per troy ounce this week as investors seek a "safe haven" asset. This surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, ongoing international trade disputes, and the prospect of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Since the start of 2025, gold futures have increased by nearly 60%, reflecting deep-seated anxiety in the market. The increased demand for precious metals like gold and silver indicates a broader investor pessimism about the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Travel Portland, the city's tourism promotion agency, has updated its website to counter President Trump's critical remarks and encourage travel, describing the city as safe for visitors. The agency characterizes the ongoing protests at the federal ICE facility as "relatively small and typically peaceful," noting the facility's location is isolated from major tourist areas. This portrayal contrasts sharply with the White House's description of the events as "radical violence." Travel Portland, which is primarily funded by local lodging taxes, is making a concerted effort to manage public perception and maintain the city's tourism industry amid the political spotlight.</p>

          <p>The FBI has arrested a Louisiana resident, Mahmoud Amin Ya’qub al-Muhtadi, for allegedly participating in the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. According to a criminal complaint, al-Muhtadi, an operative of a Hamas-aligned paramilitary group, armed himself and crossed into Israel during the attack. He is accused of later lying on his U.S. visa application by denying any involvement in terrorist activities, subsequently gaining legal permanent residency in 2024. The investigation, which utilized social media and phone records, could lead to charges of visa fraud and providing support for a foreign terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean, this time resulting in survivors who are now in U.S. custody. President Trump confirmed the target was a "narco-submarine" built for transporting large quantities of drugs. This is reportedly the sixth such strike in the region since last month, bringing the total death toll from these operations to at least 28. The administration justifies the lethal force by claiming an "armed conflict" with drug cartels, a legal stance that raises significant questions under international law and has caused concern among human rights organizations.</p>

There are widespread fears that this review could lead to the elimination of entire departments, particularly those focused on ethnic, gender, and regional studies. These concerns are amplified by a new state law that disbands faculty senates, concentrating power with administrators, and by a recent essay from the new provost criticizing "identity-studies frameworks."

          <p>Amid market volatility and shifting interest rates, many Americans are considering annuities to secure their retirement income. This article suggests that for those prioritizing safety, fixed annuities are currently one of the most stable choices. These products function similarly to a certificate of deposit, offering a guaranteed interest rate for a set period and protecting the principal from market downturns. With current rates in the 5% to 6% range, fixed annuities provide an opportunity to lock in relatively high, predictable returns.

Concurrently, Bonta announced a $1.7 million settlement with four other producers who agreed to stop selling the bags in California.

          <p>The classic 60/40 investment portfolio, composed of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, is facing a significant challenge as investors increasingly allocate funds to alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency. Some strategists are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, with bonds reduced to 20% and the remaining 20% dedicated to alternatives. This shift is driven by the recent tendency of stocks and bonds to move in tandem and concerns over inflation and government debt, which have diminished bonds' traditional role as a portfolio stabilizer. The record-breaking surge in gold prices is a key factor accelerating this strategic reconsideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As key mediators in the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Egypt and Qatar are positioned to play a significant role in shaping the future of post-war Gaza. Egypt, having reasserted its diplomatic importance, is likely to be heavily involved in reconstruction efforts, leveraging its construction capacity while ensuring it is not seen as acting on Israel's behalf. Qatar aims to maintain its indispensable role as a mediator, balancing its ties with both the U.S. and Hamas leadership. The involvement of other regional powers like the UAE and Saudi Arabia will also be crucial, though they may prefer to provide financial and diplomatic backing.</p>

          <p>In the new Richard Linklater film "Blue Moon," Ethan Hawke delivers a powerful performance as Lorenz Hart, the brilliant but troubled lyricist of the Rodgers and Hart duo. The film captures Hart on the opening night of "Oklahoma!," the first major success for his former partner Richard Rodgers with a new collaborator. Set almost entirely in the Sardi's restaurant after-party, the story is an elegy for a creative genius grappling with professional irrelevance, alcoholism, and deep-seated insecurity. The review praises Hawke's poignant and egoless portrayal, suggesting it is one of the most touching and profound performances of his career.</p>

          <p>The family of Alice Webb, a mother of five who died last year after a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift, has expressed fury upon learning the practitioner involved is now illegally selling prescription weight-loss jabs online. Jordan Parke, known as the "Lip King," was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but has not been charged in Webb's death. A BBC investigation found Parke is selling semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, without a prescription, a practice experts warn is extremely dangerous. The case highlights the lack of regulation in the UK's cosmetics industry, as Webb's family campaigns for stricter controls.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues its cycle of interest rate cuts, a central debate among officials is the location of the "neutral" interest rate, or r-star. This theoretical rate is the point at which monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. Pinpointing this "Goldilocks rate" is critical, as it determines how much further the Fed can cut rates without overheating the economy. Post-pandemic dynamics, including government spending and AI-driven productivity, may be pushing the neutral rate higher, potentially signaling an end to the era of ultra-low interest rates.

          <p>This editorial posits that the U.S. justice system is shifting from a restraint on executive power to a weapon used by it under the Trump administration. The piece cites the recent criminal indictments of prominent Trump critics like John Bolton, Letitia James, and James Comey as evidence of a trend toward "rule by law" rather than "rule of law." The author argues that President Trump's rhetoric of retribution and calls to jail opponents are eroding democratic norms. This weaponization of the legal system is seen as a dangerous slide towards authoritarianism.</p>

The administration recently hosted a dinner for major donors, with leftover funds potentially being directed toward another project: a triumphal arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. The project has drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who are introducing bills to prevent donor names from being displayed on White House structures and are investigating the project's financing for potential conflicts of interest.

Drawing inspiration from her family's medical background, she aimed to create a protagonist who is smart and intuitive.

Kyiv is also seeking upgraded air defense systems and, crucially, increased U.S. intelligence sharing to enhance the effectiveness of its strikes against Russia's vital energy sector. This strategy aims to cripple Moscow's main source of war funding. The U.S. has reportedly already been providing some targeting support, which has enabled successful Ukrainian drone attacks on numerous Russian oil refineries, significantly reducing Russia's fuel production and export capabilities.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into the airspace of NATO countries like Poland and Estonia have been met with a surprisingly unified and firm response from the alliance. This article argues that Vladimir Putin's attempts to intimidate and divide NATO may have backfired, prompting the alliance to establish enhanced air defense measures along its eastern flank. There appears to be a rare alignment between European leaders and President Trump on the need to pressure Russia, with Trump even reconsidering sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. This renewed resolve suggests a shift in strategy as allies build up their own capabilities.</p>
