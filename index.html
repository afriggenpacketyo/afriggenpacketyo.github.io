          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails and purchasing the necessary ingredients. He allegedly told police that he specifically targeted the pro-Israel group, stating he "wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead." The attack, which injured 12 people, is being investigated as an act of terrorism, and Soliman remains in custody with a $10 million bond. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation and renewed concerns about antisemitism. Optimism surrounding this event is nonexistent given the extent of the crime and the lack of survivors from the victims' perspectives.</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration has temporarily halted its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a policy shift, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activities on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes, providing them with more time to address their debt and avoid benefit reductions. The administration's reprieve offers a chance for older borrowers to get current on their debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The debate also includes the state and local tax deduction, the debt ceiling, and food stamp programs, which could lead to revisions in the Senate.

Some believe Labubu's success lies in its ability to tap into universal emotions through design and marketing, rather than focusing on Chinese heritage.

          <p>President Trump is urging Republican friends in the Senate and House to pass the GOP tax megabill before the Fourth of July holiday. The legislation includes deep cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs, sparking concern among Americans.

Trump claims there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, and that they will be saved from the incompetence of the Democrats. There is a moderate level of optimism given the stability that comes from the Trump administration's directness.</p>

Nickerson, who had a history of criminal convictions and committed suicide in 1993, was linked to the crime through witness accounts and a retracted statement.

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensify attacks and engage in negotiations, the Trump administration has taken a less prominent role in mediating the conflict. President Trump has shown increasing disengagement, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio's involvement has been minimal. Despite the lack of progress in negotiations, the caliber of attacks launched by both sides has escalated. A bipartisan group of senators is pushing for tougher sanctions on Russia, but Trump has not taken action. The war seems to be escalating with no sign of peace.</p>

          <p>J.D. Scholten, a Democratic Iowa state representative, has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Sen. Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her remarks about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to concerns about Republican cuts to Medicaid by saying, "Well, we're all going to die." Scholten criticized her leadership and aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy. The race has a chance to become more competitive due to the incumbent's controversial statement. There is a chance of political progress.</p>

          <p>Harvard University claims a Defense Department official urged the Trump administration not to terminate a $12 million biological threat research grant, citing national security risks. Internal documents reviewed by Harvard lawyers suggest the White House directed the abrupt freezing of over $2 billion in federal funds for the university's research programs. The official stated that "inadequate knowledge of the biological threat landscape poses grave and immediate harm to national security." Harvard argues the government's actions violate federal law and infringe on the university's First Amendment rights. The public is generally concerned about the lack of research.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. The divers believed the longline was illegal and freed the animals, but were charged after officials said the line belonged to a licensed researcher. The pardons erase the convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely. The event is generally seen as a positive step.</p>
