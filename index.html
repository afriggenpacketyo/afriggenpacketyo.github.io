          <p>President Trump has expressed his disapproval of Vladimir Putin's recent attacks on Ukraine, labeling Putin as "absolutely crazy" and questioning what has happened to him. Trump stated that he is not happy with Putin's actions, citing the killing of many people through missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. He also warned that if Putin attempts to conquer all of Ukraine, it would lead to the downfall of Russia. In the same breath, Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's communication style, stating that it is causing problems. Optimism about the end of the conflict remains low given the escalating attacks and the lack of a ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests China should aim for a 4% GDP growth target over the next five years. This adjustment accounts for potential prolonged rivalry with the U.S. and the need to address structural issues within China's economy. Xu emphasizes the importance of prioritizing employment expansion and debt ratio control. He argues that setting a target higher than China's potential growth rate would be inappropriate, given international complexities and domestic challenges like property issues and weak market confidence.

          <p>Spain hosted representatives from European and Arab nations in a meeting of the "Madrid Group" to discuss applying pressure on Israel to end the war in Gaza.

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Naval and Merchant Ships, suggests that Beijing could cripple Taiwan by targeting key infrastructure, leading to a systemic collapse. The article identifies 30 to 40 critical targets, such as liquefied natural gas facilities, whose destruction could disrupt essential services like electricity and water supply. This tactic, termed "urban collapse warfare," aims to undermine Taiwan's resistance and create conditions for a "win without fighting." Taiwan's high dependence on imported resources and vulnerability to natural disasters make it susceptible to this strategy.</p>

          <p>Experts are debating whether artificial intelligence could become conscious, a topic long explored in science fiction. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has prompted some to believe that AI systems may soon develop independent consciousness. Others, however, argue that consciousness is linked to being alive and cannot be replicated in machines. The discussion raises concerns about the potential impact of AI on human relationships and moral priorities, including the possibility of humans caring more for AI systems than for each other.</p>

The company uses a three-pronged approach, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, to identify and remove fake reviews.
