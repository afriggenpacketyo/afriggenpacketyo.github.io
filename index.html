Cooper welcomes the Metropolitan Police's investigation and says the government intends to strengthen laws protecting important memorials. The police are investigating the incidents as criminal damage, with graffiti such as 'trans rights are human rights' found on the statue of Jan Smuts. The Greater London Authority is working to remove the graffiti using specialist equipment, emphasizing the importance of freedom of speech while condemning criminal damage. Optimism score is 60.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, ensuring detainees have a chance to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely and without sufficient information. The ACLU's lawsuit challenges the administration's use of the AEA to deport migrants allegedly tied to the Tren de Aragua gang, citing concerns about their safety in El Salvador's prisons.

            <p>Former President Donald Trump expressed optimism that Russia and Ukraine could reach a deal following a temporary Easter ceasefire, suggesting both countries could benefit economically from stronger ties with the U.S. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of violating the ceasefire thousands of times. Trump's statement comes amid ongoing efforts to broker a peace agreement, with recent reports indicating the U.S. has eased its demands for repayment of aid to Ukraine. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick echoed Zelenskyy's skepticism, emphasizing Vladimir Putin's unreliability and the need for a just and lasting peace. Optimism score is 40.</p>

            <p>Max Verstappen's five-second penalty at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix for cutting a chicane and retaining the lead after the start has ignited a debate about racing standards. McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who ultimately won the race, believed he was far enough alongside Verstappen to warrant the corner. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner deemed the penalty 'very harsh'. The stewards' verdict justified the penalty by stating that Piastri complied with the driving standards guidelines, which effectively say that the corner was Piastri's in that situation.
