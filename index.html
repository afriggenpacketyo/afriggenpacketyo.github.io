          <p>A federal judge found Apple in contempt of court for willfully violating a 2021 injunction related to the Epic Games case, accusing the company of creating anticompetitive barriers to maintain revenue from its App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple Vice President Alex Roman lied under oath about Apple's decision to levy a 27% fee on some purchases linked to its App Store, and that Apple withheld documentation of a meeting with CEO Tim Cook about complying with the court order. Effective immediately, Apple must cease imposing commissions on purchases made for iPhone apps through web links and pay Epic Games' attorney fees. Apple plans to appeal the decision, while Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed it as a victory for developers, forcing Apple to compete with other payment services. The judge referred the case to US attorneys to investigate whether to pursue criminal contempt proceedings on both Roman and Apple.</p>

          <p>A fan at the Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh fell over the outfield wall and landed on the playing field, leading to a delay in the game. The incident occurred moments after Andrew McCutchen hit an RBI double, with another fan jumping from the lower part of the outfield wall to assist the injured individual. Trainers and police immediately responded, and the fan was carted off the field on a stretcher. The game was delayed for approximately 10 minutes, during which numerous players were seen praying. The Pirates ultimately won the game 4-3; the condition of the person who fell remains unknown.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans may have to "do with less" as a result of the ongoing trade war with China, marking the first time he has conceded the potential negative impacts of the tariff standoff on American consumers. While previously stating there would be disruptions, Trump suggested that Americans might have fewer non-essential goods, such as dolls, but insisted that the trade war would ultimately be worse for China, which relies on the U.S. as a market. Trump argued that many of the goods imported from China are not essential and that the U.S. needs to secure a fair trade deal, viewing China as the "chief-ripper-offer."</p>

Approximately 500 firearms were located amidst the debris, many severely damaged, after the fire burned over 23,000 acres. The LAPD is asking individuals who believe they lost a firearm in the fire to contact the department's Gun Recovery Unit, providing proof of address and a description of their firearm. The Palisades Fire, along with the Eaton Fire, resulted in significant damage and economic losses, making it the worst natural disaster in Los Angeles County history.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Oklahoma's attempt to create the nation's first online Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The case could have far-reaching implications for the separation of church and state, potentially leading to public funds flowing directly to religious schools. Justices appeared divided, with some concerned about unconstitutional discrimination against religious institutions, while others worried about weakening the wall between church and state. A ruling in favor of the school could upend laws in numerous states and the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert in China has cautioned against excessive reliance on artificial intelligence, highlighting potential security risks.

This warning comes amid a surge in popularity of China's AI chatbot DeepSeek, which has garnered significant backing from authorities. Qi emphasized that large AI models, while powerful, present vulnerabilities that could be exploited to commit malicious acts under the guise of AI assistance.</p>

          <p>The certification of China's C919 passenger plane by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is expected to be delayed, potentially taking three to six years, according to EASA executive director Florian Guillermet.

Despite the delay, analysts do not anticipate this will deter Comac, the manufacturer, from pursuing entry into major overseas markets. The C919 has been in regular use on domestic flight paths since its first commercial flight in May 2023, transporting over 1 million passengers as of January 2025.</p>

The preliminary vote supported increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent for two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the coming months. Tenant advocates expressed concerns that the increases would push lower-income New Yorkers closer to the brink, while landlords argued the increases were insufficient to cover rising expenses. The decision reflects a balance between protecting rent-stabilized homes and avoiding overburdening tenants, but has left both groups dissatisfied.</p>

          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, as Senate Republicans largely united in opposition. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, would have terminated the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The vote was 49 to 49, falling short of the majority needed for passage. The measure was largely symbolic, as it was unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. The vote came amid growing anxiety over the economic impact of the tariffs and a slowing economic growth in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and U.S. officials have signed a joint economic investment deal that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals. The Treasury Department announced the establishment of a "United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund," referring to it as an "economic partnership." Ukraine's economic development minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, confirmed that she signed the deal, describing it as a 50/50 partnership that includes development of mineral, oil and gas projects. President Trump had pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about an economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's minerals, framing it as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's cloud computing unit has unveiled its Qwen3 family, consisting of eight enhanced AI models with parameters ranging from 600 million to 235 billion. Analysts suggest that these models indicate Chinese companies have significantly closed the technology gap with US firms in artificial intelligence. Despite US export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, the pace of innovation in China is expected to continue. The growing availability of alternative AI chips from domestic suppliers, such as Huawei Technologies and Cambricon Technologies, has diminished the impact of sanctions on China's AI development efforts.</p>

          <p>For hospitality workers in Las Vegas, tips are a crucial part of their income, and inflation has made it challenging to afford basic necessities. President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips caught the attention of many, but 100 days into his second term, no legislation has been enacted. Union leaders are urging Trump to take real action on this issue, and two bills are currently working their way through committees. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes revenue from tariffs could fund the plan inside a sweeping tax package due this summer. If the promise is fulfilled, workers would have hundreds of dollars more each month.</p>

          <p>The report of economic contraction in the first quarter has underscored the political risks for President Trump as he pursues an aggressive trade war. The news came at the end of a quarter in which stock prices were down sharply, adding to widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers. If the report proves to be a harbinger of an extended slowdown or recession, the situation could become the economic analog of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s fumbled withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago this summer. The economic pain of the tariffs could start within months, with upward pressure on prices and shortages of both industrial and consumer products made abroad.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park officials are warning visitors to be cautious of mule deer, which cause more injuries to humans than any other animal in the park. While seemingly harmless, these wild animals can lash out and defend themselves if startled, especially when approached or fed. Bucks are prone to aggressive behavior during mating season, and females can be protective of their fawns. Feeding and approaching wildlife in Yosemite is illegal, and visitors are advised to maintain a safe distance.</p>

While earnings and revenue topped estimates, those results are backward looking.
