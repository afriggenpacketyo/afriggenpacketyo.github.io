          <p>Todd Blanche, former criminal attorney for President Trump, has been appointed acting Librarian of Congress by the Justice Department, raising questions about his qualifications for the role. This appointment follows the firing of Carla Hayden, the first woman and first Black person to hold the position, creating turmoil within the Library of Congress. The appointment has sparked criticism from Democrats, including Representative Joe Morelle and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who argue that the position should be appointed by a congressional commission rather than the president. The article highlights the controversy surrounding the appointment and the concerns raised about the politicization of the Library of Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices by asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce costs in the United States. However, the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices, leading to skepticism about its effectiveness. The order directs federal agencies to investigate why European countries have lower drug prices and encourages them to pay more. Pharmaceutical stocks rose following the announcement, as investors were relieved that the policy was less damaging than anticipated. The article also mentions ongoing efforts by Democrats to align American drug prices with those of foreign peers and notes the popularity of policies aimed at lowering drug costs among voters.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, as part of President Trump's tax and spending package. This provision aims to address concerns from lawmakers in high-tax states like California, New Jersey, and New York, where the current $10,000 limit has been a point of contention. Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the $10,000 limit on the federal deduction on state and local taxes is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, contributing to a surplus for the month.

While the U.S. continues to face a significant budget deficit, the increase in tariff revenue helped reduce the imbalance in April. High interest rates remain a considerable burden on the budget, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion for the month.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal Church announced it is ending its partnership with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, citing moral opposition to resettling white Afrikaners from South Africa, who have been classified as refugees by the Trump administration. The church stated that the request crossed a moral line, given its commitment to racial justice and historic ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. The announcement comes as the Trump administration has largely frozen the refugee program, with Afrikaners among the few being granted entry as refugees.</p>
