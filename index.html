          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded her testimony in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, facing cross-examination from defense attorneys who challenged the consistency of her accounts and the harm she allegedly suffered. Ventura recounted alleged violence, blackmail, and forced participation in sex parties orchestrated by Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The defense attempted to portray Ventura as a willing participant in a toxic relationship, highlighting instances where she was also violent towards Combs. Ventura expressed that she would return the $20 million civil settlement she received from Combs in 2023 if it meant she never had to participate in a freak off.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic activity, including business deals in the Gulf, lifting sanctions on Syria, negotiating the release of a U.S. citizen, and claiming credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, suggests a foreign policy focused on trade over war. Trump's approach emphasizes mercantilism and downplays ideology, as seen in his speech in Riyadh advocating for "commerce not chaos." However, his decisions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria, have surprised even those within his own administration and have faced criticism for a lack of consistency and potential negative consequences.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of GOP Tax Bill Shows Disproportionate Benefits for Wealthy</h2>

          <p>A Republican-backed tax bill touted by the White House as delivering permanent tax cuts and bigger paychecks is projected to disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, according to analyses from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) and the Tax Policy Center. The top 20% of Americans would see a larger increase in after-tax income compared to the bottom 20%. Some Republicans oppose the bill, citing insufficient cuts to federal spending. The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that low-income households could be worse off due to cuts in federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a week of lavish praise in the Middle East, President Trump returned to the U.S. and launched a social media tirade against critics, including Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. Trump threatened Springsteen and questioned Swift's popularity after she criticized him. The outburst followed a four-day tour in the Middle East, where Trump enjoyed opulent displays of support. The White House communications director declined to clarify the nature of Trump's threats, further fueling concerns about the president's reaction to dissent.</p>

          <p>A top adviser to the director of national intelligence ordered a senior analyst to redo an assessment of the relationship between Venezuelaâ€™s government and a gang after intelligence findings undercut the White Houseâ€™s justification for deporting migrants. President Trumpâ€™s use of a wartime law to send Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador without due process relies on a claim that U.S. intelligence agencies think is wrong. But behind the scenes, a political appointee told a career official to rework the assessment, a direction that allies of the intelligence analyst said amounted to pressure to change the findings.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, including Derrick Groves, convicted of multiple killings, escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, triggering a large-scale search operation. Officials warned the public to be on the lookout for the armed and dangerous individuals. The inmates reportedly escaped through a hole in the wall of a cell, leaving messages mocking law enforcement. Authorities are investigating the escape, citing defective locks and a lapse in security. The jail has been under scrutiny for civil rights violations and is subject to a reform pact with the federal government.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rebuked Texas judges for moving too quickly to deport detained Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, ruling that they must be offered a hearing. The justices emphasized the importance of due process rights and faulted the lower courts for failing to protect those rights. The ruling does not prevent the government from removing the detainees under other lawful authorities. President Trump criticized the decision, while the ACLU praised it as a victory for due process.</p>

          <p>A hospital in Georgia is refusing to remove life support from a brain-dead pregnant woman due to the state's abortion ban, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected. The family is upset that they don't have a say in the matter, and doctors have told the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health. A spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement to CBS News on Friday, "There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill faces obstacles in the House of Representatives due to disagreements among Republicans. Key sticking points include the amount of budget cuts, cuts to Medicaid, the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and food assistance. Some conservative Republicans want steeper cuts to reduce the national debt, while others oppose cuts to Medicaid. Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on the SALT deduction. The bill's fate remains uncertain as Republicans struggle to reconcile these competing priorities.</p>
