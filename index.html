          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first in a series of anticipated agreements during the reciprocal tariff pause. While details are still being finalized with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the deal aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers. A 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain will remain, but the first 100,000 vehicles exported annually from British automakers to the U.S. will be subject to this rate, with additional vehicles facing higher rates. The administration is also monitoring developments between Pakistan and India after recent exchanges of fire.</p>

Critics, including autism researchers and privacy experts, are questioning how the data will be used and protected, citing concerns about potential abuse and the identification of individuals.

          <h2>Companies Plan to Pass Tariff Costs to Consumers, Data Suggests</h2>

          <p>Recent economic data indicates that many companies plan to pass tariff costs on to consumers, potentially leading to increased prices. Surveys show that a majority of manufacturers intend to pass tariff-related expenses to consumers, while retailers have warned of likely price hikes on U.S. imports. Economists and analysts predict that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, will boost consumer prices in the coming months, affecting low- and middle-income households. Some companies, such as Stanley Black & Decker and Procter & Gamble, have already announced price increases to offset higher costs.</p>

          <p>India launched strikes on Pakistan following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries. The risk of all-out war rose despite diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict, with both sides claiming military successes and accusing each other of aggression. The strikes targeted alleged terrorist infrastructure, but also resulted in civilian casualties, raising concerns about further escalation. International calls for de-escalation have been made, but the situation remains volatile, with the potential for greater conflict looming.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain announced a deal to reduce tariffs on certain imports, including steel, cars, and ethanol, marking the first such agreement since President Trump increased tariffs in April. While hailed as a success by both countries, the deal is narrowly focused and still requires further negotiations to finalize. The agreement provides relief for Britain's auto industry, but leaves a 10 percent tariff in place on most other goods. Despite the positive step, the economic impact is limited, and broader trade uncertainty remains.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to a pro-Palestinian demonstration in the main library differed significantly from past incidents, with campus security intervening aggressively and making arrests. The university's tougher stance satisfied critics, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, but disturbed those who felt the response was excessive. Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti, and the university is moving to tighten control of discipline. The article also notes the pro-Palestinian movement has splintered and become more hard-line, while officials are considering visa reviews for international students involved in the protest.</p>

The company's business is closely tied to consumer spending, with executives noting that the U.S. economy contracted in the first three months of 2025 due to import surges ahead of Trump tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering releasing the audio of former President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur during the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents. The administration was provided the audiotape weeks ago, although the transcript of the interviews was released in 2024. This potential release comes as the Trump administration fights to keep former special counsel Jack Smith's report on Trump's handling of classified documents under wraps. The move could be seen as politically motivated, given the critical comments about Biden's memory in Hur's report.</p>

          <p>Krispy Kreme's stock experienced a 24% plunge after the doughnut chain announced it is 'reassessing' its rollout with McDonald's and withdrew its full-year outlook, citing economic 'softness.'

The decision was prompted by sales falling below projections, leading to concerns about profitability.

Analysts suggest that a pro-crypto Trump administration and buying from spot-ETF investors have contributed to Bitcoin's recent strength. Rising tensions between India and Pakistan and concerns about Federal Reserve policy are expected to further test Bitcoin's resilience.</p>

The Italian judge ruled that the alleged sexual acts were consensual. The attorney argues the timing of the accusation, just before the civil trial, suggests it was a deliberate attempt to influence media and public opinion. Haggis maintains his innocence in both the Italian case and the New York civil case, where he was found liable for sexual assault and ordered to pay $10 million.</p>
