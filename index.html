          <p>New Jersey is facing significant transportation disruptions due to a locomotive engineers' strike, sinkholes on Interstate 80, and ongoing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. The strike has halted New Jersey Transit's rail service, impacting commuters and travelers. Sinkholes have closed lanes on I-80, causing traffic delays, while Newark Airport is experiencing runway closures, technology outages, and a shortage of air traffic controllers. Residents express frustration with the transportation chaos, but maintain a resilient attitude characteristic of the state. </p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the start of extensive ground operations throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and ultimately destroy the group. This escalation occurs even as indirect cease-fire talks are underway in Doha. The military has conducted numerous airstrikes, reportedly killing Hamas operatives and destroying military infrastructure, but also causing civilian casualties. Prime Minister Netanyahu signaled a willingness to discuss a broader deal to end the war, but reiterated demands for the release of all hostages, expulsion of Hamas leaders, and demilitarization of Gaza. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers designated Chris Taylor for assignment, ending his 10-year tenure with the team, as they made room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. Taylor, a former All-Star, was in the final season of a four-year contract, but his declining production and the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim made him expendable. The Dodgers also added pitcher Lou Trivino to the roster following an injury to Kirby Yates. This move marks another departure of a veteran player as the team continues to evolve its lineup. </p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum reflects on the legacy of Desi Arnaz and his impact on Hollywood, highlighting his role in breaking racial barriers and revolutionizing television production. Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, challenged network executives' skepticism and insisted on playing Lucille Ball's husband on television, leading to the creation of the iconic show "I Love Lucy." Arnaz's innovative approach to filming and syndication transformed the industry, and his success paved the way for greater diversity and inclusion in entertainment. Arnaz's story serves as an example for performers and institutions to embrace diversity and challenge preconceived notions. </p>

          <p>Ukraine reported that Russia launched a large-scale drone attack targeting several regions, including Kyiv, resulting in casualties. The attack occurred just before a scheduled call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, where Trump is expected to push for a ceasefire. Ukraine's air force reported intercepting 88 drones, but many others went astray, causing damage and injuries. This escalation follows recent face-to-face talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey, which yielded little progress beyond a prisoner swap agreement. The attack is viewed as an attempt by Russia to demonstrate force and potentially intimidate Ukraine before the discussions between Trump and Putin. </p>

Khanna expressed his focus on regaining the House and advocating for a working-class economic agenda. </p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailing ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, which was on a goodwill tour, reportedly lost power before drifting into the bridge. The incident prompted a response from emergency services, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The ship had a navigational clearance of 127 feet, while the ship's masts were roughly 160 feet tall. </p>

          <p>Palm Springs is grappling with the aftermath of a bomb explosion outside a fertility clinic, classified as an intentional act of terrorism. Authorities identified Guy Edwards Bartkus, 25, as the suspect, believed to have died in the blast. An online manifesto potentially linked to Bartkus indicated opposition to pro-lifers and intentions to target a fertilization clinic. The clinic's director confirmed that no embryos were harmed, and the facility plans to reopen soon. The bombing caused extensive damage, with debris scattered across blocks and nearby buildings affected. </p>

          <p>After a half-decade pause of collection activity on federal student loans, the Trump administration announced on April 21 that it would once again seize defaulted borrowers' federal tax refunds, paychecks and Social Security benefits. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers within a few months, according to the Education Department. In an environment where the cost of living remains stubbornly high, this kind of withholding from your income can pose real problems when trying to make ends meet, and force people into choosing between vital expenses," said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.
