          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged dozens of individuals, including Miami Heat's Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, in a major illegal gambling investigation. The case involves two interconnected schemes: one concerning insider sports betting where players allegedly faked injuries, and another involving high-stakes poker games rigged with sophisticated technology operated by organized crime families. The NBA has placed both Rozier and Billups on immediate leave while cooperating with the ongoing investigation, which spans 11 states and includes charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and extortion. The arrests represent a significant crackdown on illegal betting operations with ties to professional sports.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new four-year study conducted in Southern California has found a significant link between contaminated meat and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Researchers discovered that 18% of over 2,300 UTIs were caused by E. coli strains identical to those found in meat samples from local grocery stores, with chicken and turkey being the most common sources. The study, published in the journal mBio, suggests that UTIs should be considered a food safety issue, not just a personal health problem. It also noted a higher risk for individuals in low-income areas, prompting calls for improved food safety regulations and handling practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has pivoted its approach toward Russia regarding the war in Ukraine, canceling a planned summit in Budapest and imposing new sanctions on major Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil. This move signals a departure from President Trump's previous preference for diplomatic engagement, reflecting frustration with Moscow's refusal to compromise on ending the conflict. Russian officials, including President Putin, have condemned the sanctions as an "unfriendly act," while former President Dmitry Medvedev described them as an "act of war." The change in strategy came after preparatory talks indicated a summit would not be productive, as Russia remains determined to control Ukraine's Donbas region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he would not proceed with a plan to send the National Guard into San Francisco to address crime, citing progress made by the city and calls from prominent tech leaders. In a social media post, Trump mentioned that he was swayed by conversations with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, among others, who expressed optimism about the city's future. He also acknowledged that Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie was making "substantial progress" on the issue. The decision is being viewed as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie and the city's leadership.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed concern over the financial strain on air traffic controllers during the ongoing government shutdown, leading many to take on second jobs like driving for Uber. Speaking at a press conference, Duffy stated he does not want essential personnel in such high-stress roles to be overworked and distracted by financial pressures, as it could impact aviation safety. He acknowledged that the Department of Transportation "can't guarantee" flights will remain on schedule, as staffing shortages may force the agency to slow down air traffic to maintain safety standards. The comments highlight the growing impact of the shutdown on critical federal services.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to endorse his former political rival, Andrew Cuomo, in the city's upcoming mayoral election. This surprising alliance sees Adams, who recently dropped his own reelection bid, supporting the centrist former governor against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist. The endorsement marks a significant reconciliation between the two powerful New York figures, who had previously exchanged sharp criticisms. Cuomo is positioning himself as the only candidate capable of defeating Mamdani and is seeking to consolidate support from moderate and Republican voters in a contentious race for control of the city.</p>

The memo, written before the indictment was secured, reportedly concluded that any financial benefit James received was minimal—around $800 in the first year—and that proving intentional fraud would be difficult due to vague federal guidelines on home occupancy. This information surfaced after President Trump publicly called for James' ouster and appointed an interim U.S. Attorney who subsequently obtained the indictment.

          <p>The UK government is standing by Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips despite calls for her replacement from four members who quit the survivors' panel for the national grooming gang inquiry. The resignations have created turmoil for the high-profile inquiry, but another group of five survivors has written to the prime minister expressing their support for Phillips and stating they will only continue if she remains in her role. Government sources indicate a determination to keep Phillips in her post while acknowledging the difficulty of establishing trust with victims. The process of appointing a permanent chair for the inquiry is now expected to take several months.</p>

          <h2>Deep Divisions Over Scope and Leadership Plague UK's National Grooming Gang Inquiry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's planned national inquiry into grooming gangs is facing significant challenges before it has even begun, with deep divisions emerging among survivors on its advisory panel. Key points of contention include the inquiry's scope and the choice of its chairperson. Some survivors who resigned are concerned the inquiry's focus will be diluted to include other forms of child abuse, while others remaining on the panel support a broader remit. There is also disagreement over whether the chair should be a judge or an expert with a background in policing or social work, reflecting a profound lack of trust in the state institutions that previously failed them.</p>

He is also charged with visa fraud for allegedly lying on his U.S. visa application about his affiliation with terrorist organizations and his training with firearms.

          <p>A former British soldier, known only as Soldier F, has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry, Northern Ireland. He was accused of murdering James Wray and William McKinney and attempting to murder five others during a civil rights march where 13 people were shot dead. The judge, while stating that paratroopers had shot unarmed civilians and lost all discipline, concluded that the evidence against Soldier F specifically did not meet the threshold for a conviction. The verdict is a deeply emotional and disappointing outcome for the victims' families, who have campaigned for justice for over 50 years.</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Robert Garcia, are requesting that the Trump administration release all documents related to President Trump's administrative claims seeking approximately $230 million from the Department of Justice. The claims are for damages related to the Russia investigation and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago. In their letter, the congressmen argue that any payment to the president beyond his salary would violate the Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause. The request also seeks correspondence involving former Trump defense attorneys who now hold senior DOJ positions and could be involved in deciding on the claims.</p>

          <p>Shares in the French luxury group Kering rose sharply, closing up 8.7%, after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales and a narrower decline at its flagship brand, Gucci. While overall sales were down 5% compared to the previous year, this marked a significant improvement from the 15% drop in the second quarter. Sales at Gucci fell 14%, but this was also a "sharp sequential improvement" from its 25% plunge in the prior quarter. The results suggest that CEO Luca de Meo's turnaround strategy, which includes focusing on core fashion businesses, is beginning to show positive results and rebuild investor optimism.
