          <p>New Orleans police have made another arrest in their ongoing investigation into the jail escape from the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility. Emmitt Weber, 28, was arrested on suspicion of accessory after the fact of simple escape for allegedly assisting two of the escaped inmates. As of Friday, five of the ten escaped inmates remained at large, with Corey Boyd being the most recent prior arrest. Authorities are continuing their search for the remaining fugitives and those who may be aiding them in their evasion of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Investigators are probing whether technical issues at a San Diego airport, including an inoperative weather data system and a runway lighting problem, combined with foggy conditions, contributed to a fatal plane crash. The Cessna 550 crashed into a residential neighborhood near Montgomery Field Airport, killing all six people on board and injuring eight on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board is receiving help from the FBI to collect evidence, and is examining the lack of a flight data recorder on the aircraft to determine what factors led to the crash. The pilot did not report any issues prior to the crash.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are raising concerns about the impact of cuts to weather balloon sites implemented by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The reduction in balloon sites, including those in Michigan, Wisconsin, the Rocky Mountains, and Tornado Alley, is leaving gaps in critical weather data. Meteorologists say that weather balloons are irreplaceable for collecting air pressure and moisture data, and that these cuts could impact the accuracy of forecasts, warnings, alerts, and updates, ultimately affecting public safety. A NOAA spokesperson defended NWS forecasting, stating they are committed to delivering accurate forecasts through strategic transformation and staff reallocation.</p>

Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March 2024 for the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was killed when Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun loaded with a live round. Gutierrez-Reed was paroled to her home in Arizona and will be subject to electronic monitoring, curfew, and employment or school enrollment requirements. Baldwin, who also faced the same charge, had his case dismissed after evidence was withheld by prosecutors.</p>

The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts, causing fires and requiring medical care for six people.

          <p>The White House is implementing a restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), resulting in staff reductions and reassignments, with some aides being placed on administrative leave. The changes come weeks after President Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the national security adviser, replacing Mike Waltz. Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, and White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel will take on top roles as deputy national security advisers. The restructuring is driven by a desire to streamline the NSC and ensure staff loyalty to the President, following previous accusations of disloyalty.</p>

          <p>Linwood Riddick, a 79-year-old retired shop owner, earned a college degree from South Carolina State University to honor the victims of the 1968 Orangeburg Massacre. Riddick, a New York native, was moved by a campus memorial and dedicated his education to the three unarmed Black students who were killed by police during a protest against segregation. He pursued his degree in music industry, starting with zero credits in 2019, and completed it with a standing ovation, later paying respects at the memorial. His dedication has brought renewed attention to the event.</p>

          <p>President Trump's private dinner for customers of his cryptocurrency business included notable figures such as Chinese billionaire Justin Sun and lawyer Elliot Berke, according to a guest list obtained by The New York Times. The dinner was an event where Trump leveraged his position for financial gain, benefiting both his crypto business and his Virginia golf club. Attendees gained invitations by becoming top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin, with the top 25 receiving VIP status and a White House tour. The event has drawn scrutiny due to the involvement of individuals with legal issues and the blending of official duties with personal business ventures.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant cuts to the White House National Security Council, reducing the number of policy experts, according to an official who was let go. The goal is to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication, with most parts of the operation shifting back to their home departments and agencies. The NSC will be left at approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term. Trump has leaned more on cabinet members as he makes foreign policy decisions rather than recommendations coming up from the NSC.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for New Orleans jail escapees has sparked scrutiny, with civil rights organizations and politicians raising concerns about privacy and constitutional rights. While authorities credit facial recognition cameras run by Project N.O.L.A. with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, the New Orleans Police Department had previously paused automated alerts from the organization due to legal and policy concerns. Critics argue that citizens are being scanned without their knowledge or consent, while supporters claim the technology is essential for fighting crime. The debate highlights the broader ethical and legal questions surrounding the use of facial recognition in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, serving as both secretary of state and national security adviser, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. This move aligns with President Trump's preference for top-down foreign policy decision-making, where advisers implement his desired outcomes. The NSC, traditionally a coordinating body across departments, has faced distrust from Trump since his first term, as he believes it undermined his policy views.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are adapting to human influence, specifically the use of hummingbird feeders. The study found that the beaks of these birds have become longer and more slender, allowing them to access nectar more efficiently from feeders. Male beaks have also grown pointier to compete with other males at the feeders. This has also led to the hummingbird expanding its range further north. The study also noted the influence of the growing abundance of eucalyptus forests.</p>
