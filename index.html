          <p>A Texas homeowner fatally shot two masked men late Friday after they posed as officers serving a warrant and opened fire on his house, according to authorities. The Houston Police Department responded to reports of gunfire in the southeast part of the city around midnight. The homeowner grew suspicious because the individuals wore bulletproof vests marked "police" and badges but lacked patrol cars or flashing lights, which was captured by a Ring camera. After the suspects fired into the home, the residents returned gunshots, killing both men at the scene, with officers attempting CPR before they were pronounced dead. This incident underscores the homeowner's right to self-defense against a deceptive and violent intrusion.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler, interviewed on "Face the Nation," criticized gerrymandering nationwide, advocating for its ban and term limits, arguing it fundamentally breaks Congress by reducing competitive districts. He addressed the persistent crime issue in New York, supporting federal assistance like National Guard troops but emphasizing the critical need for prosecuting gun crimes more effectively. Lawler also expressed general opposition to government ownership stakes in private companies, specifically regarding the U.S. government's 10% stake in Intel, while acknowledging the national security implications for semiconductor manufacturing.

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, will have her "unsparing" memoir, "Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice," published posthumously in October. Giuffre, who tragically died by suicide in April, had completed the manuscript and expressed a "heartfelt wish" for its release to shed crucial light on systemic failures that enable the trafficking of vulnerable individuals. The book promises new, intimate, and disturbing details about her time with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their many well-known friends, including Prince Andrew, though it contains no allegations against Donald Trump. The memoir has been rigorously fact-checked and legally vetted by the publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo stated he would not quit, but could not guarantee his position beyond the summer transfer window due to a strained relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Nuno's dissatisfaction primarily stems from the club's transfer market activity, despite significant new signings, as he feels the squad remains incomplete. While fans continue to support him after the team's successful previous season, European football experts suggest that publicly questioning the owner is a battle a manager will likely lose. Discussions with the owner and global head of football are planned to address the ongoing transfer situation and seek harmony.</p>

          <h2>Former Palantir Employee Warns of Invisible Dangers from AI Surveillance Technologies</h2>

          <p>A former Palantir Technologies graphic designer, Juan Sebastian Pinto, warns that the company's AI surveillance tools, known as Istar systems, pose an invisible and pervasive danger to civil rights. These technologies, extensively used by agencies like ICE and the IDF, track and detain individuals by combining immense amounts of publicly and privately sourced data, leading to severe concerns about racial profiling, wrongful detention, and warrantless data searches. Pinto argues that lawmakers and media are failing to comprehend the weaponized AI's profound impact, which is increasingly affecting vulnerable populations globally and could extend into the private sector for behavioral shaping. Growing protests against Palantir advocate for privacy and robust AI consumer protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey stated that Britain faces an "acute challenge" from its weak underlying economic growth and a significant post-pandemic decline in its workforce. He cited a concerning rise in long-term sickness and a substantial drop in young people in work, exacerbated by an aging population, as key contributing factors. Bailey emphasized the urgent need for concerted efforts to boost economic productivity, as official data shows the UK's labor market participation for 16-64 year olds is notably lower than other advanced economies. This situation contributes to fears that the UK's inflation rate, currently the highest in the G7, may be slow to return to its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

A pending Louisiana lawsuit alleges Dickerson sexually assaulted a 17-year-old student in 1984, bringing these disturbing documents to light. Concerns from high-ranking Jesuits were initially overridden, with superiors believing his "psychosexual problem was under sufficient control," a claim later contradicted by psychological reports. This case raises serious questions about the church's handling of abuse and challenges the active cause for canonization of former superior general Pedro Arrupe, who was aware of the concerns.</p>

The White House reportedly plans to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to address crime, homelessness, and immigration, despite local leaders' objections and statistics showing a recent drop in serious crime. This move highlights a growing federal-state conflict over domestic military deployment and presidential authority.</p>

          <h2>Harvard Economist Revisits Failed Bitcoin Prediction, Citing Regulatory Lapses and Political Influence</h2>

          <p>Harvard Economics Professor Kenneth Rogoff explained why his 2018 prediction that Bitcoin had a greater chance of falling to $100 than hitting $100,000 proved wrong, as its value soared past $100,000. He attributed his miscalculation to being overly optimistic about sensible cryptocurrency regulation in the US, underestimating Bitcoin's role as a transaction medium in the global underground economy, and not anticipating the "brazen corruption by the Trump administration" regarding crypto holdings. Bitcoin proponents, however, argue Rogoff still fundamentally misunderstands the asset's underlying blockchain technology and its broader societal impact beyond illicit uses, advocating for its democratizing potential in finance.

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) early Sunday, sending a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of critical equipment and supplies. The workhorse Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, with its first stage booster landing safely on an offshore droneship after launch. This mission, CRS-33, carries essential science gear, crew supplies including fresh food, and notably, an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the ISS's altitude, marking a new propulsion capability for Dragon capsules. The mission underscores 25 years of continuous human presence and scientific research on the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military announced it killed 35 jihadists in air strikes near the Cameroon border and rescued 76 kidnapping victims, including women and children, from a "bandit" camp in Katsina state. The rescue operation followed an attack where gunmen opened fire on worshippers and residents, killing at least 50. These actions come amidst a decade-long struggle against jihadist groups and violent criminal gangs, with prominent Nigerians raising concerns about "war-time levels of slaughter" in a country officially at peace. The US recently approved a $346 million weapons sale to Nigeria to aid in quelling the widespread unrest.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Kajiki is rapidly approaching Vietnam, prompting the mandatory evacuation of over 586,000 people from central provinces as it is expected to strengthen further before making landfall early Monday. The intensifying storm is packing winds of 166km/h and is forecast to bring up to 400mm of rain and dangerous storm surges of 2-4 meters. Flights have been cancelled, boats ordered ashore, and soldiers deployed to assist in the evacuation and preparedness efforts. Officials warn of extreme danger to vehicles, structures, and aquaculture facilities, fearing Kajiki could be as devastating as Typhoon Yagi last year, which caused hundreds of deaths.</p>

          <p>Three young sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, tragically drowned in an overcrowded rubber boat carrying migrants across the central Mediterranean from Libya, as reported by German rescue charity RESQSHIP. The vessel, dangerously full and taking on increasing amounts of water in rough seas, led to the rescue of about 65 people, including the girls' mother and brother. Many survivors suffered severe chemical burns from the mixture of seawater and petrol inside the boat. This horrific tragedy underscores the extreme dangers faced by migrants seeking safety, with UN agencies reporting over 700 deaths in this perilous crossing alone this year, urging increased search and rescue operations.</p>

His address followed Russian claims of Ukrainian drone attacks on energy facilities, including a nuclear plant, which Ukraine's disinformation center labeled as Russian propaganda. The day also saw a successful prisoner swap and strong international support, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announcing a $2 billion military package, and messages of solidarity from US envoy Keith Kellogg and King Charles.

          <p>US nuclear sanctions on China, including the blacklisting of China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), have reportedly backfired, inadvertently hindering the West's own atomic energy revival. Despite the sanctions, China has made "incredible" and advanced progress in its nuclear capabilities, becoming an unattainable benchmark of efficiency. As the US and Europe struggle with costly delays and atrophied supply chains, China's exclusion threatens to stall their nuclear expansions. Industry leaders advocate for a balance between global cooperation and local participation to strengthen the supply chain, acknowledging the global nature of the nuclear industry.
