          <p>An Eritrean man has been returned to France from the UK as part of a new "one in, one out" migrant exchange agreement, following a significant court victory for the British government. The High Court ruled that France is a safe country, allowing the removal to proceed despite a last-minute legal challenge related to human trafficking claims. This case marks the first successful, legally contested removal under the pilot scheme, which aims to deter illegal small boat crossings by creating a formal returns process. The ruling strengthens the government's hand in immigration matters, contrasting with the previous Rwanda plan that was blocked by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward an agreement regarding TikTok's U.S. operations following a phone call, though a final deal has not yet been reached. The White House confirmed the productive conversation, which followed conflicting statements from Trump and Chinese state media about the status of the negotiations. The discussions aim to resolve the national security concerns that led to a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American business or face a ban. Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline, signaling a desire to keep the popular video-sharing app operational in the United States.</p>

          <p>Scottish government minister Jamie Hepburn has resigned from his post after being accused of physically assaulting Conservative MSP Douglas Ross. The allegation stems from an incident where Hepburn reportedly grabbed Ross and swore at him aggressively following a dispute in the Holyrood chamber. In his resignation letter, Hepburn stated that his actions did not align with his personal code of practice, irrespective of whether they breached the Ministerial Code. First Minister John Swinney accepted the resignation with regret, while Ross called it the correct decision, emphasizing that the behavior fell well short of the standards expected from ministers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a Republican-led short-term spending bill aimed at preventing a government shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The measure, which passed by a narrow 217-212 vote, extends government funding for just over seven weeks and includes additional funds for lawmaker security. The bill now faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where it will require Democratic support to overcome the 60-vote threshold for passage. Democrats have signaled strong opposition, proposing a counteroffer with different priorities, setting the stage for a contentious fight as the deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that athletes from Russia and Belarus will be permitted to participate in the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Games as neutral individuals. This decision maintains the sanctions previously applied for the Paris 2024 Summer Games, which were imposed following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Competitors will not be allowed to use their national flags or anthems, and they must undergo a vetting process to ensure they have no links to the military or have not actively supported the war.

He also highlighted a major risk to the broader market, warning that rising 10-year Treasury yields could negatively impact many stocks, similar to headwinds seen in the previous year. Cramer also commented on Nvidia's new collaboration with Intel, framing it as a strategic win for Nvidia's expansion into the enterprise data center market.

          <p>Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's controversial 2008 plea deal, appeared before the House Oversight Committee for a closed-door deposition. Acosta, who later served as Labor Secretary under President Trump, resigned from that post amid renewed scrutiny over his role in the non-prosecution agreement, which has been widely criticized as overly lenient. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that lawmakers have serious questions about why Epstein was not more aggressively prosecuted despite numerous warnings about his crimes.

          <p>A new wave of AI-powered companions, such as the device named "Friend," is being marketed as a solution to the growing epidemic of loneliness, but this article argues they are merely a symptom of the problem they claim to solve. The author contends that Silicon Valley is selling a cure for a disease it helped create, as addictive social media and other technologies have replaced genuine in-person interactions with shallow digital substitutes. Rather than fostering human connection, these AI tools further entrench users in isolation by offering simulated relationships. The article concludes that the real solution is not more isolating technology, but a reevaluation of the products that have eroded social ties.</p>

          <p>The fate of TikTok's U.S. operations may depend on a potential licensing deal for its powerful and closely guarded algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations between the U.S. and China. Previously, the Chinese government and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, appeared unwilling to sell the core technology, which is credited with the app's immense popularity. However, recent statements suggest a softening stance, with a possible framework allowing a U.S. entity to use the algorithm under specific terms rather than owning it outright.

Investigators also found shell casings near the scene with engraved messages, including online memes and a reference to an anti-fascist song, which Robinson reportedly described as "mostly a big meme." While these details provide some insight, the exact motive remains unclear, and prosecutors have been cautious about specifying what role political ideology played in the attack.</p>

This would free up canal slots for other vessels and provide an alternative transit method for energy products. These initiatives aim to reverse the decline in LNG transits, which saw many tankers divert to longer routes, and come as the canal forecasts a broader decrease in freight volume.

People can contract the bacteria by exposing an open wound to contaminated water or by consuming raw or undercooked seafood.

          <h2>Investigation Finds Walmart's Rapid Marketplace Growth Accompanied by Counterfeits and Fraud</h2>

          <p>A CNBC investigation reveals that Walmart's push to rapidly expand its third-party online marketplace has led to significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers. The report found that in its effort to compete with Amazon, Walmart relaxed its seller vetting processes, making it easier for bad actors to join the platform and sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health and beauty items. Dozens of sellers were found to be using the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to open their accounts. While the strategy has helped Walmart's e-commerce business become profitable, it has come at the cost of consumer trust and safety.</p>

          <h2>Apple CEO Tim Cook States Recent iPhone Price Hikes Are Unrelated to Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent price increases for new iPhone models are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the launch of the latest iPhone, Cook stated directly that tariffs were not factored into the new pricing structure, which saw a $100 increase for the iPhone 17 Pro model. To mitigate the impact of trade levies, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, moving some production to countries like India and Vietnam. The company previously reported taking an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in a single quarter, making the pricing strategy a key focus for analysts.</p>

          <p>MMA fighter Raja Jackson has been arrested on felony charges after brutally attacking professional wrestler Stuart Smith during a scripted event at a wrestling academy in Sun Valley. The incident, which was livestreamed, showed Jackson running into the ring and delivering numerous real punches to Smith, who appeared to be unconscious. The unscripted assault reportedly stemmed from a confrontation before the show where Smith had smashed a beer can on Jackson's head as part of a different livestream. While the initial incident was believed to be part of a performance, the subsequent beatdown was a genuine act of violence leading to Jackson's arrest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The guidance confirms that workers in specified service fields like healthcare, legal, and financial services will not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, the rules specify that automatic gratuities, such as mandatory service charges for large parties at restaurants, do not count as qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments. The new tax break, enacted as part of a larger bill in July, is set to apply from 2025 through 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal seeks to eliminate all funding for the Migrant Education Program (MEP), a nearly 60-year-old federal initiative that supports over 250,000 children of seasonal agricultural workers. The program provides crucial services like tutoring, summer enrichment, and college readiness workshops to students who face educational disruptions due to their families' frequent moves for work. Advocates and former participants argue that cutting the program would remove a vital lifeline that helps a vulnerable population overcome barriers and achieve academic success. The proposal has created uncertainty and fear for the future of thousands of children whose parents are essential to the nation's food system.</p>

The committee decided to indefinitely postpone a vote on a controversial proposal to delay the first hepatitis B vaccine dose for newborns, citing ambiguity and the need for more discussion. This move came after the panel also reversed a vote from the previous day, now recommending against insurance coverage for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (MMRV) shot for young children. The chair of the committee acknowledged that the panel members are largely inexperienced, which contributed to the procedural confusion and reversals.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led House resolution to honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "courageous American patriot" is causing division among Democrats. While House Democratic leadership plans to vote for the measure, they are not requiring members to do so, leaving individual lawmakers to decide on the politically sensitive vote. Some Democrats have expressed discomfort with honoring Kirk due to his past controversial statements, fearing the resolution is a messaging trap. The debate reflects the broader political tensions following Kirk's killing and comes amid criticism of the FCC for pressuring ABC to suspend host Jimmy Kimmel over his comments on the matter.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old prison support worker, Megan Breen, has been given a 10-month suspended sentence for having an inappropriate relationship with an inmate at HMP Prescoed in Wales. The court heard that Breen, who is now pregnant, exchanged hundreds of romantic messages with the prisoner and had a sexual encounter with him while he was on home leave. The relationship came to light after a colleague raised concerns, leading to an investigation that found Breen had used prison databases to access the inmate's photo. The judge cited Breen's remorse, pregnancy, and childcare duties as exceptional reasons for suspending the prison sentence.</p>
