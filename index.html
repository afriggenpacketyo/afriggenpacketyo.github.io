        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether Joe Biden's administration used an autopen to sign key documents, alleging a conspiracy to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The memo cites executive actions by Biden and suggests that the use of an autopen could invalidate those actions. Trump claims his predecessor's pardons were illegitimate, and that Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public about his mental state. Biden has dismissed these attacks as false and a distraction, affirming that he made all decisions during his presidency. The political climate appears tense, with Trump's actions seen as a continuation of his efforts to undermine Biden's legacy.</p>

          <p>Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program are in jeopardy as the U.S. and Iran publicly disagree on the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, insisting that Iran will not halt uranium enrichment. President Trump contradicted his negotiators by stating that the agreement would prohibit any enrichment. The possibility of a sixth round of negotiations remains unclear, with both sides expressing mistrust and dissatisfaction with the proposed terms. The situation appears precarious, with little indication of a breakthrough in the near future.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard University, citing concerns that the school is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs. The order directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of current international students and accuses Harvard of failing to report student disciplinary records and having ties to researchers in China. A Harvard spokesperson condemned the order as retaliatory and a violation of the school's First Amendment rights, vowing to protect its international students. This action escalates the administration's ongoing feud with Harvard, which has included attempts to cut federal funding and criticism of the university's handling of pro-Palestinian protests. Optimism is low given the escalating tensions and restrictions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a travel ban on citizens from 12 countries and partial restrictions on seven others, citing national security concerns.

Trump justified the ban by referencing a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, despite the suspect being from a country not on the list.

The study examines the evolution of flight feathers, a critical step in the evolution of birds, with insight into how feathers evolved during the Cretaceous period. Researchers were able to study feathers that are 99 million years old. While modern birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

The department has notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, and requires a plan for compliance.

The study found that infants with this bacteria were less likely to be hospitalized for lung infections within their first two years of life. Researchers believe these bacteria interact with the immune system, aiding in its development and ability to differentiate between harmful and beneficial microbes. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery, highlighting the importance of early microbial exposure.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill, prompting concerns about access to the medication. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, following a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center that claims the pill harms women. Experts, however, argue that these safety concerns are misguided and that the report lacks transparency and scientific rigor. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge targeting the availability of mifepristone in 2024, but this new review could potentially impact access to the drug.</p>

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss injections to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK's drug safety experts caution that the impact of these medicines, like Wegovy and Mounjaro, on unborn babies is unknown. These prescription drugs are licensed to treat obesity by mimicking hormones that create a feeling of fullness. Concerns are growing that the increasing popularity of these "skinny jabs" means women are not using them safely or receiving appropriate medical advice, particularly when purchasing them from unregulated sources.</p>

The full ban applies to nations including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iran, while heightened restrictions affect visitors from countries like Burundi and Cuba.
