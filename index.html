        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Prime Minister's office and the Foreign Office were reportedly aware of emails showing a supportive relationship between Lord Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein before the Prime Minister publicly defended him. Sources indicate that while senior officials knew of the correspondence, Prime Minister Keir Starmer was not personally briefed on the emails' contents when he made his initial supportive statements. This has led to criticism from within the Labour party regarding the government's internal communication and vetting processes, culminating in Mandelson's dismissal as US ambassador once the emails became public knowledge. The situation has intensified pressure on Starmer's leadership and raised questions about operational failings within his administration.</p>

          <p>Calm has returned to Kathmandu following the appointment of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. Her appointment follows days of intense, youth-led anti-corruption protests that resulted in at least 51 deaths and led to the collapse of the previous government. Known for her strong anti-graft stance, Karki's selection was the result of negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives. In one of her first acts, the new prime minister recommended dissolving parliament and setting new elections for March 5, a move intended to address the economic and political grievances that fueled the widespread unrest.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both declining birth rates and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to support women returning to work after childbirth. Initially, the program will cover 20 new mothers at Shanghai’s branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who are under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have given birth within the last two years. While the initial scope is limited, the program is seen by some female researchers as a positive step towards creating a more supportive environment in a demanding field.</p>

Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76 respectively, were arrested in February and remain in custody without knowing the charges against them. Hall described their conditions as inhumane, stating the couple is "literally dying" and that time is running out to secure their release. The couple, who had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, requires urgent medical care, a concern echoed by the UN and their family, who fear they will not survive their detention.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Bill to Prohibit On-Duty Police from Wearing Face Coverings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 03:42:45 EDT</div>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would largely prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identity while on duty. The measure, which now awaits the governor's signature, was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where federal agents concealed their faces. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for public trust and accountability, especially after a recent Supreme Court ruling expanded agents' authority. However, law enforcement groups and Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, contending that face coverings are essential for protecting officers from harassment and ensuring their safety during dangerous operations.</p>

          <p>NATO is reinforcing its eastern flank with additional troops and fighter jets after approximately 19 Russian drones entered Polish airspace, an act Poland has described as a deliberate provocation. In response, Denmark, France, and Germany have committed aircraft to a new mission aimed at bolstering regional air defense, with other allies expected to join. The incident, which saw some drones shot down while others crashed, marks the most serious airspace violation since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. The move underscores heightened tensions across Europe, with leaders calling for vigilance against what they perceive as Russian aggression testing the alliance's resolve.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential implications of Cristiano Ronaldo returning to play in the United States after a 12-year absence, framing it as a significant development for the upcoming World Cup. The author suggests that Ronaldo's presence could serve as a major endorsement for the event, particularly amid concerns over gun violence and the political climate under President Trump. The piece speculates that a change in the US administration may have cleared the way for his return, given past sexual assault allegations that coincided with his absence. Ronaldo's return is positioned as a powerful branding opportunity that aligns with the interests of both FIFA and a Trump-led America.</p>

While the Armenian government has provided compensation to affected homeowners, the division has created a political crisis and protests against the current administration.

          <p>This opinion article uses the recently revealed Jeffrey Epstein birthday album as a lens to examine the widespread cultural normalization of the sexual exploitation of underage girls in previous decades. The author recalls how movies, music, and mainstream culture in the 1970s and 80s often depicted or excused relationships between adult men and teenage girls, citing examples from films and the lives of celebrities. The piece argues that this permissive environment, where sexual assault was often dismissed or blamed on the victim, has been challenged and changed primarily through the efforts of feminism. Feminism, the author contends, has been crucial in establishing the concepts of consent and power dynamics, thereby denormalizing such abuse.</p>

The attack has angered the key mediator Qatar, strained relations with the United States, and potentially jeopardized negotiations for the release of remaining hostages.

The game was ultimately decided when Giants catcher Patrick Bailey hit a grand slam in the bottom of the tenth inning, highlighting the Dodgers' ongoing struggles with late-game execution and offensive consistency.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the 2021 disappearance of British woman Sarm Heslop from a yacht in the US Virgin Islands has reached a 'dead end,' according to police, who have released the last known CCTV footage of her. Heslop was last seen boarding a dinghy with her boyfriend, Ryan Bane, who reported her missing hours later, suggesting she fell overboard. However, inconsistencies in the timeline and Bane's refusal to allow a forensic search of his yacht have raised questions. Bane, who has never been formally questioned and remains the sole person of interest, maintains his innocence through his lawyer, while Heslop's family continues to seek answers.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region early Saturday morning. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries resulting from the seismic event. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a potential tsunami threat but later retracted it, stating there was no longer a danger. This event follows a series of five powerful quakes that hit the same peninsula in July of the previous year.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to perform strongly in local elections in Gelsenkirchen, a traditional stronghold of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). The AfD has capitalized on local discontent over issues like dilapidated housing and crime, which they link to labor migration from Southeast Europe. After becoming the strongest party in the city during recent federal elections, the AfD is now aiming for further success, potentially forcing a runoff in the mayoral race. Local social workers and anti-fascist activists express fear that an AfD victory could lead to funding cuts for integration projects and social services.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-immigration protests across Australia have left some Chinese nationals feeling insecure and unwelcome. A 27-year-old Chinese woman living in Perth described cancelling her plans to leave her house during the marches due to safety concerns.

Having moved from Melbourne to Perth to improve her chances of gaining permanent residency, she and her husband now grapple with the heightened sense of being outsiders in their adopted community.
