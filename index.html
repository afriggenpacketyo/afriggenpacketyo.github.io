          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to climb. Despite the positive results, the company acknowledged that consumer demand remains soft, particularly among low-income consumers in North America and Europe. To address this, Coke is focusing on affordable options like mini cans to maintain volume. The company's water, sports, coffee, and tea segments saw the largest volume growth, while it reiterated its full-year financial forecast.</p>

          <p>A study published in the journal Nature Electronics details the development of an analogue AI chip by Chinese researchers that could be significantly more powerful than current technology. The team claims their approach could offer 1,000 times higher throughput and 100 times better energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors like those from Nvidia. Unlike digital computing's binary system, analogue computing uses continuously variable values, which has historically been limited by precision issues that this new research aims to overcome.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Atlanta arrested a man who allegedly threatened to commit a mass shooting at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The suspect's family alerted police after he streamed his intentions on social media, leading to his swift capture inside the terminal. An AR-15 rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was discovered in his truck parked outside. Officials, who identified the suspect as a felon with mental health challenges, stated that the family's intervention and quick police collaboration successfully prevented a tragedy.</p>

          <p>The latest population estimate for the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is 384, a modest 2.1% increase from the previous year, offering a glimmer of hope for the species. Researchers called this "positive news" and noted a trend of slow growth over the past four years, with no reported deaths in 2025. However, conservation groups stress that the species remains dangerously close to extinction and continue to call for stronger government protections against vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement.</p>

          <p>A cultural critique of the celebrated 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" re-examines its plot, pointing out a significant and troubling element: the romantic relationship between the adult male coach and a teenage female player. The article argues that while the movie was groundbreaking in its handling of race, gender, and culture, this central relationship now appears highly inappropriate. This modern perspective is informed by a greater awareness of power dynamics and abuse in women's sports, suggesting a potential sequel would need to address this aspect directly.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology combining a tiny retinal implant with specialized glasses has shown significant success in restoring central vision for patients with atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In a multi-national trial, over 80% of participants experienced notable improvements, with some regaining the ability to read several lines on an eye chart. The "PRIMA" system works by converting images from a camera into electrical signals that stimulate remaining retinal cells, offering new hope for a leading cause of sight loss in older adults.</p>
