          <p>Brooklyn Beckham, son of David and Victoria Beckham, spoke about his shared passion for racing with his father in an interview, amidst speculation of tension within the family. Brooklyn credited his dad for inspiring his love of racing and mentioned his collection of cool cars, including a 1954 Jaguar. His comments came after he and his wife were absent from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebration, reigniting rumors of a feud between the couple and his parents, though both Brooklyn and his wife have previously denied any feud. The article also mentioned that the relationship is definitely not beyond repair, and that they love and are always there for him, but that they are just hurt and disappointed that he's now playing no part in family life.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese authorities are facing criticism for removing the "Han" category from demographic groups on the Executive Yuan's official information page, a move perceived as an attempt to distance the island from mainland China. The change categorizes Han Chinese, the majority population on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as "other population". This revision comes as the Democratic Progressive Party intensifies efforts to promote Taiwan's indigenous identity while diminishing historical and cultural ties with mainland China. The previous page stated that Han Chinese comprised 96.4% of Taiwan's total population, but now the page says Taiwan has a registered population of 2.6 per cent indigenous, 1.2 per cent foreign and 96.2 per cent other population.</p>

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang discusses the ongoing trade war between the US and China, highlighting its unsustainable nature and potential for resolution through negotiation. He notes the growing recognition in the US that extreme tariffs are detrimental, citing weak economic data and instability in the dollar. Yao Yang believes that both sides are realizing the harm caused by the trade war, making a deal highly likely. He suggests a rollback to the original 34 per cent tariff level as a realistic first step, along with potential US demands for China to purchase more American goods.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, known for providing affordable medical care to all residents, is under strain due to a shrinking workforce and aging population, and is now entangled in political maneuvering. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust in government. The government is seeking funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased costs for high medical cost patients. The government ultimately froze the hikes and postponed a new plan until after the upper house election, indicating the sensitivity of the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks with the Qatari government regarding the donation of a luxury Boeing 747 airplane, which could temporarily serve as Air Force One. The offer, first reported by ABC News, has raised legal and ethical questions, especially concerning potential conflicts of interest. While the White House confirmed that any gift would be accepted in compliance with all applicable laws, some Democrats have questioned the legality of the deal, with one senator describing it as a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. Qatar has also offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense, but the gift will not be donated or accepted during this trip to Qatar, a U.S. official said.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have halted all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to concerns over the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized that this decision is about food and animal safety, not politics. The New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds or mucous membranes of animals, feeding on their flesh and blood. The U.S. and Mexico had previously eradicated the screwworm in the 1960s and '70s, but cases have resurged in parts of Central America and are now being detected in remote farms in Mexico. The ban will continue on a month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it would release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, the last known living US citizen hostage in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel. The decision comes ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East, with Hamas citing it as a goodwill gesture to facilitate humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, which has been under Israeli blockade. The Israeli prime minister's office acknowledged the US informed them of Hamas' intention, anticipating it could lead to further hostage negotiations. The Families and Missing Families Forum urged that Alexander's release mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement for all hostages, while talks between Hamas and the US continue amid reports of Trump administration frustration with Netanyahu's position.</p>

The materials were confiscated by a federal judge due to concerns they could impact Argentina's neutrality in the war. The court has transferred the boxes to a secure room and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to participate in their preservation and inventory. Experts will examine them for clues about unknown aspects of the Holocaust, including international financing networks used by the Nazis.</p>

Caremark's decision aims to lower drug prices for employers by 10 to 15 percent, according to a company spokesman, but it restricts doctors' ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions to individual patient needs.

Researchers noted that both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those with more weight to lose. Both drugs work by tricking the brain into feeling full, but subtle differences in how they work explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>

Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate, had fired prosecutors handling Jan. 6 criminal cases and controversially referred to U.S. Attorneys as "Trump's lawyers." While some former prosecutors express concerns about Pirro's provocative TV pronouncements, others see her as a more suitable replacement than Martin.

          <p>Families of 9/11 victims who worked for Howard Lutnick's bond trading company are urging him to help extradite a Saudi Arabian national potentially involved in the attacks. In a letter, the families cited unsealed evidence linking Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi intelligence agent, to the attackers. As Commerce Secretary, Lutnick is preparing for economic talks with Saudi Arabia as part of an upcoming trip to the Middle East. The families urged Lutnick to make the case that Mr. al-Bayoumi be brought to justice, pointing out that information about Mr. al-Bayoumiâ€™s potential involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks was obscured for years.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that had strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the Japanese temple. Following the theft, South Korean authorities arrested the thieves and confiscated the statue, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

          <p>California, despite becoming the world's fourth-largest economy, faces an unprecedented confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges. Analysts suggest the state's population may decline due to wildfires, immigration crackdowns, and young people moving to other states. Los Angeles is grappling with a $1 billion budget shortfall and struggling with homelessness, while the state faces an adversarial relationship with the federal government. Despite these challenges, some leaders remain optimistic about California's resilience, citing its history of overcoming disasters and its wealth.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Gulf states this week will focus on securing new investment for the U.S. economy, particularly from sovereign wealth funds. He aims to showcase his "America First" agenda by attracting Gulf money to boost domestic manufacturing and job creation. The visit includes a Saudi-US investment forum featuring leaders from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Saudi Arabia has already committed to investing $600 billion in the U.S., but Trump seeks to increase that to $1 trillion, including purchases of U.S. military equipment. The focus is also on attracting greater Gulf investment into U.S. tech firms and boosting the region's access to American semiconductors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Chinese delegations concluded trade talks in Switzerland with "substantial progress," according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, though specific details remain scarce. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested an agreement had been reached but provided no specifics. The talks, aimed at stabilizing world markets affected by the U.S.-China standoff, took place in Geneva. President Trump claimed "great progress" had been made and hinted at lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials said they are open to negotiating but want the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. The outcome of the talks could impact global financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade.</p>

          <p>The United States will suspend imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border with Mexico for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm. Secretary Brooke Rollins stated that the screwworm, a potentially fatal parasite, was recently detected in remote farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio BerdeguÃ© expressed disagreement with the measure but is confident an agreement will be reached soon. The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place.</p>
