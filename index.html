          <p>Japan has strongly condemned North Korea's ongoing missile development program, asserting that it poses a significant threat to regional peace and stability. The Japanese government considers these actions unacceptable and a violation of international norms. Japan is closely monitoring the situation in coordination with its allies, including South Korea and the United States, and is prepared to take appropriate measures to safeguard its security. The Japanese government is urging North Korea to cease its provocative actions and engage in constructive dialogue towards denuclearization and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its legal battle with Epic Games, arguing that the ruling, which requires Apple to allow developers to include external payment links in their apps, could cost the company substantial sums. The company states that complying with the order would disrupt its App Store ecosystem and negatively impact its business model, potentially costing them hundreds of millions to billions of dollars annually. Apple is appealing the contempt ruling, asserting that it has complied with the court's original order and that the new ruling is punitive rather than coercive. Apple argues that the changes forced by the ruling reduce consumer choice and damage its business.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are touting a newly enacted law designed to support the country's private economy, framing it as a crucial foundation for future growth, especially as China navigates ongoing trade disputes with the United States.

The legislation is intended to unleash the internal momentum and creative vitality of the private sector, which is seen as increasingly important for China's economic development. The law clearly defines the legal status of the private economy and the government's support for it for the first time.</p>

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, has been charged with federal hate crimes for allegedly assaulting Jewish protesters at multiple demonstrations in Manhattan. According to prosecutors, Bazrouk kicked and punched protesters wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags at three separate events. The F.B.I. investigation revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and messages indicating antisemitic views on Bazrouk's cellphone, leading to accusations of supporting antisemitic terrorist organizations. The charges come amid heightened scrutiny of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and accusations of antisemitism, with the Trump administration taking an aggressive stance toward such protests.</p>

The nuclear-armed archrivals have fought numerous wars, with the disputed area of Kashmir as a prime flashpoint, since 1947. After Indian forces struck Pakistan and its side of the disputed Kashmir region, Pakistani military officials said that more than 20 people had been killed and dozens injured after six places were hit on the Pakistani side of Kashmir and in Punjab Province.</p>

          <p>Three college presidents from institutions outside the Ivy League apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing. The hearing, titled “Beyond the Ivies,” focused on schools that received F grades from the Anti-Defamation League, with Republicans threatening to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools. The Democratic minority accused Republicans of tolerating antisemitism in their own party while using it as a political weapon against others. The hearing looked back to events from a year ago, when campuses across the country were reeling from protest encampments and mass arrests, while the Trump administration has opened investigations at dozens of universities over accusations of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Raul Celis Lopez, a Peruvian journalist known for reporting on corruption and gang violence in Iquitos, was murdered by hitmen. The journalist was shot in the head by two unidentified men on a motorbike as he was heading to work. Press freedom organizations condemned the killing, with Reporters Without Borders calling Lopez's death a "tragic wake-up call." This is the second killing of a reporter in Peru this year, amid a concerning decline in media freedom in the country.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after paying 15,000 employees to leave through a deferred resignation program. The need to fill positions so soon after letting people go has raised questions, with Rollins acknowledging some mistakes may have been made along the way. Rollins invited some of those who took the deferred resignation offer to return if they were in key positions. There were also conflicting accounts from employees about whether APHIS employees were allowed to accept deferred resignation in April.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means as the new Surgeon General, replacing Janette Nesheiwat, who withdrew her nomination. Dr. Means, known for her work in functional medicine and her views on nutrition and health, will work closely with HHS Secretary Robert F.

Dr. Means has catapulted into the MAHA sphere over the past year, alongside her brother Calley Means, a prominent advisor to Sec. Kennedy following the publication of their book Good Energy.</p>
