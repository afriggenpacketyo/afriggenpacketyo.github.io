          <p>Illinois Senator Dick Durbin announced his retirement, stating he will not seek reelection in 2026, marking the end of a long career in the Senate. Durbin, who has served since 1996, expressed his love for the job but acknowledged it was time to pass the torch, while emphasizing the importance of addressing current challenges facing the country. He has been a key figure in initiatives like the Dream Act and the First Step Act, and his departure is expected to lead to a significant reshuffling within the Democratic Senate leadership. Several Illinois politicians are expected to contend for his soon-to-be-vacant seat.</p>

          <p>A group of former OpenAI employees, Nobel laureates, and civil society organizations are urging California and Delaware attorneys general to block OpenAI's restructuring into a for-profit entity. They argue this move would compromise the company's charitable purpose and remove crucial governance safeguards designed to prioritize humanity. Concerns have been raised that the restructuring would allow OpenAI to pursue profit over safety, potentially leading to the development of dangerous AI technologies. Critics emphasize OpenAI's original commitment to a legally binding duty to humanity, which they believe this change would abandon.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, including those on auto parts imported from China and levies on steel and aluminum, but this would be separate from the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts scheduled to take effect in May. Simultaneously, Trump suggested that the 25% tariff on cars imported from Canada could increase, signaling a complex and potentially shifting trade landscape for the automotive industry. Automakers and auto policy groups have been lobbying for tariff relief, citing the cumulative burden on the industry.</p>

Despite the criticism, Sanders is projected to be a first-round pick, and his father, Deion Sanders, believes the scrutiny is due to his own legacy. Sanders' college career includes impressive stats, throwing for 14,347 yards and 134 touchdowns.</p>

          <p>Experts are casting doubt on President Trump's claim that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos prove his membership in the MS-13 gang, as Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Trump shared an image of Abrego Garcia's hand with digitally added labels interpreting the tattoos as gang symbols, but experts argue the markings alone are unreliable indicators of membership. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record, and his family denies any gang involvement. The case raises concerns about misidentification and the use of tattoos as primary evidence of gang affiliation.</p>

          <p>China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, directly criticized US policy under President Trump during an informal UN Security Council session. Fu accused the US of "hegemonic interests" and defended China's countermeasures to Trump's tariff policy as safeguarding global interests.
