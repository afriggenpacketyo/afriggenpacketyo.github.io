          <p>President Trump signed an executive order modifying tariffs on carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would negatively impact U.S. manufacturing. The changes aim to prevent tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imports from Canada and Mexico from accumulating on top of the 25% tariff on auto imports. Automakers assembling cars in the U.S. will be able to apply for tariff relief for a portion of their imported components, which will be phased out over two years. Despite these concessions, analysts warn that the policies could still increase car prices and threaten the financial health of automakers and their suppliers, but auto executives have expressed gratitude that Mr. Trump had addressed at least some of their concerns.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and his Liberal Party narrowly failed to win a majority in the Canadian Parliament, requiring support from other parties to pass legislation. The election was heavily influenced by President Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods and threats to annex Canada, which Mr. Carney campaigned against. While the election result is a success for the Liberals, Carney now faces the challenge of defending Canada from the economic damage caused by the trade war with the United States. In his acceptance speech, Carney warned Canadians of difficult times ahead and vowed to protect Canada's interests in dealing with Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly adjusted tariff policies during his first 100 days back in office, aiming to address trade deficits and encourage U.S. manufacturing. Recent actions include easing tariffs on car manufacturers by offering offset credits and preventing the stacking of auto and steel tariffs. These changes stem from negotiations with various nations and industry leaders, reflecting a flexible approach to trade. While some tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum, remain in effect, Trump has suggested that increased tariff revenue could lead to lower taxes for U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>A new study links phthalates, chemicals commonly found in plastics, to an estimated 350,000 heart disease deaths globally in 2018. The research suggests that phthalates, known endocrine disrupters, may increase the risk of metabolic disorders like obesity and Type 2 diabetes, contributing to cardiovascular issues. While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they caution that the study relied on complex statistical modeling and assumptions, making it difficult to determine the exact number of deaths linked to these chemicals. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between phthalate exposure and heart health.</p>

          <p>President Trump congratulated Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on his election victory, and the two leaders agreed to meet in the near future. The two countries are expected to discuss a new economic and security relationship following the election. Trump's trade tariffs and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty had previously overshadowed the race. Carney has emphasized the importance of Canada and the United States working together as independent, sovereign nations.</p>

          <p>UPS announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting effort linked to a reduction in package volume from Amazon, its largest customer. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of UPS's workforce. The move is part of a broader plan to consolidate facilities and the workforce, with the company also planning to close 73 buildings. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of the consolidation plan. The company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's cuts to Americorps, alleging that the administration is attempting to "dismantle" the volunteer service organization. The lawsuit argues that the cuts violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers. The states claim that the cuts will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on residents and the public. The White House defended the cuts by citing concerns about Americorps' financial accountability.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Tony Blair called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is "doomed to fail." Blair's report argues that global institutions have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change and that the public has lost faith in climate policies. The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors. Downing Street rejected Blair's suggestions, affirming its commitment to achieving net zero emissions.</p>
