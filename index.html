          <p>A teenager and two adults in their 40s died in a single-vehicle crash on the M5 in South Gloucestershire after a white BMW left the northbound carriageway. A second child sustained serious injuries and was hospitalized. The road was initially closed in both directions due to the severity of the incident, but the southbound motorway and two lanes of the northbound carriageway have since reopened, with one northbound lane and the entry slip road at junction 14 remaining shut as investigators work at the scene. The incident occurred at approximately 21:00 BST on Friday. The authorities are still investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients are being denied hip and knee replacements by some NHS areas and health boards in Wales to reduce costs, despite NICE guidance stating BMI shouldn't restrict access to joint replacement surgery. Patients are required to lose weight before being eligible, but weight loss program waiting lists are long, and some services have closed. The Royal College of Surgeons criticized the policy, warning that denying care could worsen patients' health. The revelation was uncovered in an audit of referral criteria used by NHS bodies in England by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a research project to find environmental toxins as the cause, despite the fact that studies suggest genetic factors are the primary driver of autism. Experts say the increase in autism rates is mainly due to expanding definitions, awareness, and screening. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, and researchers fear Kennedy's focus on toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated new therapies. The article suggests that Kennedy's approach may cause confusion for families.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced school closures and triggered widespread inspections, with lead detected in multiple schools and several students testing positive for high lead levels. The city's efforts to address the crisis were hampered when the Trump administration eliminated the CDC's lead exposure team, leaving Milwaukee without federal expertise. While Milwaukee has replaced some lead water service lines, thousands more remain, and local officials are seeking state or federal funding to complete the project. The situation highlights the challenges cities face when federal support is withdrawn during public health emergencies.</p>

This follows a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting Mexican artists whose music glorifies cartel violence. Grupo Firme had recently distanced itself from such music. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico declined to comment on the specific case due to confidentiality laws.

          <p>The World Food Programme (WFP) reported that crowds of civilians rushed aid trucks in Gaza, driven by hunger and desperation after nearly 80 days of a total blockade. Seventy-seven trucks loaded with flour were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by people trying to feed their families. Despite Israel easing the aid blockade, the UN says the amount sent is just over 10% of people's needs. The WFP spokeswoman Abeer Etefa told the BBC that the agency had chosen aid delivery routes closer to the populations and safer, and away from the gangs.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the overuse and often meaningless nature of corporate buzzwords, arguing that they impede trust and create insecurity among employees. While proponents claim buzzwords foster inclusion, studies show jargon hinders communication. Gen Zers may cling to buzzwords due to a lack of workplace experience, and employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. The author suggests that buzzwords are metaphors used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and advocates for using clear, real-human-people words instead.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major review of the military, amidst concerns about a "new, dangerous era" with a malevolent Russia and a less eager White House to defend Europe. The review is expected to underline the importance of nuclear weapons and the UK's commitment to NATO, while emphasizing modernizing forces with drones and adapting existing kit. The government will stress a greater need for public participation in protecting the country, including British industry creating more defence kit and expanding cadet forces. The report also suggests a new civilian force to protect infrastructure.</p>

          <p>UK steelmakers have condemned US President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminium to 50%, calling it "yet another body blow" to the industry. UK Steel warned that orders could be delayed or cancelled, with some shipments already en route across the Atlantic. While the US agreed to drop import taxes on UK steel in May, the original 25% tariff remains in place until the deal is finalized.

          <p>More than 130 former state and federal judges are urging the government to drop its charges against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, calling her indictment an “egregious overreach” by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant flee arrest at her courthouse, and faces federal charges carrying a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $350,000 fine. The former judges filed an amicus brief arguing that Dugan’s indictment “threatens to undermine centuries of precedent on judicial immunity, crucial for an effective judiciary.” After her initial court appearance, Dugan was released from detention, but the state supreme court suspended her from the bench days later.</p>
