          <p>A shooting at Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology in Inglewood, California, resulted in the death of Dr. Cameisha Clark, the college's dean, and injuries to another female employee. The alleged gunman, Jesse Figueroa, a 40-year-old unarmed security guard at the school, was apprehended near Berendo and Twelfth streets in Pico-Union after his family reported the shooting to 911. The incident, which occurred around 3:40 p.m. Pacific Time, prompted a thorough search of the campus and a large police presence, with the mayor indicating that it was an act of workplace violence. The suspect's family informed officers that the gun used was in the backseat of his car, where he was taken into custody without further incident.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines focus on a new £5 billion trade deal between India and the UK, which has drawn criticism from both the Conservative and Reform parties. The deal exempts Indian migrants from National Insurance payments, leading to accusations of a 'two-tier' tax system that undercuts British workers. While the government defends the agreement by stating that it will reduce tariffs on UK exports and provide a £4.8 billion boost for British businesses, critics argue that it will make it easier and cheaper to hire Indian workers. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer's refusal to scrap cuts to winter fuel payments for OAPs has caused turmoil within the Labour party.</p>

          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to begin talks this week in Switzerland in an effort to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the two largest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the discussions, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent Washington. Since President Donald Trump's return to the White House in January, he has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods, reaching up to 145%, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing on some US goods of 125%. These talks represent an attempt to find common ground amid escalating trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed that his tariff policies have spurred nearly $9 trillion in investments into the United States, surpassing any previous administration's achievements. However, a fact-check by CBS News reveals that these claims are not supported by concrete evidence. While companies have announced significant planned investments, the White House has not provided comprehensive data to substantiate the $9 trillion figure. Additionally, some investments cited by the administration were announced before Trump's reelection, and the comparison to the Biden administration is based on differing metrics, as future investment pledges are contrasted with completed projects from Biden's term.</p>

          <p>As cardinals gather at the Vatican to elect the next Pope, the legacy of Pope Francis looms large, with debates ongoing about whether to build on his work or steer the Catholic Church in a different direction. Pope Francis appointed approximately 80% of the cardinals participating in the conclave and sought to shift the Church's focus towards the poor and marginalized. The conclave is the most diverse in history, representing countries like South Sudan and Rwanda for the first time, which has highlighted differing needs of the Church across the globe. The new Pope will inherit a role requiring both spiritual leadership and statesmanship, navigating complex issues within the Church and on the global stage.</p>

Brady, who has a close relationship with Raiders general manager John Spytek, reportedly liked Miller's throwing technique and his potential to improve. Miller, who won two FCS national championships at North Dakota State, will join a quarterback room that includes Geno Smith and Aidan O'Connell. Smith, acquired in a trade with the Seahawks, is expected to be the starter for the upcoming season. The Raiders also signed defensive end Maxx Crosby to a record-breaking contract extension.</p>

          <p>India has reported that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and what it refers to as Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting "terrorist infrastructure." The Ministry of Defence stated that the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. This operation, labeled "Operation Sindoor," follows a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed last month. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that Pakistan has every right to respond robustly to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat reviews the Apple TV show "Your Friends & Neighbors," which stars Jon Hamm as a New York City moneyman who resorts to theft after losing his job. The show distinguishes itself by eliminating aspirational elements from its portrayal of hyperaffluence in Connecticut. Instead, the characters are depicted as unhappy, insecure, and lacking the compensations typically associated with wealth. Douthat argues that the show serves as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety by portraying the rich world as a place where unhappiness is magnified and financial security remains an illusion.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing ongoing delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and recent rain. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that multiple members are on trauma leave following an equipment failure that caused them to lose communication with pilots. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce an overhaul of the nation's air traffic control system to address these issues. Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for an investigation, while New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has requested support from Duffy.</p>

          <p>In Bristol, street sex workers are collaborating with the police and a charity to safeguard at-risk children through the Night Light initiative. These women provide crucial information on child exploitation, helping to bring child sex offenders to justice and identify children at risk. Their efforts have led to arrests and the removal of underage girls from the streets, offering them support and safety. The trust built between the sex workers and the Night Light team is essential to the project's success, as they share their experiences and worries about children they encounter.</p>

          <p>A woman in Lincolnshire, identified as Jane, had to barricade herself into her rented home for over six months due to a broken door lock that the North Kesteven District Council failed to repair promptly after she fled an abusive relationship. Government guidelines stipulate that high-risk domestic abuse victims should receive extra home security within a couple of working days. The council admitted a 'significant failing' and offered £100 in compensation. The domestic abuse commissioner has criticized the patchy implementation of target hardening, leaving many victims in daily fear. This article contains details of sexual assault.</p>
