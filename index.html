          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has maintained an injunction against a Trump administration policy that restricts passport gender markers to biological sex at birth. The policy, a reversal of the previous administration's allowance for an "X" gender marker, was challenged by the ACLU for being discriminatory. The court found the government failed to justify its appeal, noting the policy likely stems from unconstitutional prejudice against transgender Americans and causes irreparable harm to those affected.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Hunan province are considering a novel application for the country's central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, to resolve persistent payment defaults. The plan involves using the digital yuan to create a more transparent and traceable system for clearing "chain debts," where funds can be directed to the final recipient in a payment chain. Analysts suggest this could enhance real-time visibility and control over transactions within the economy, expanding the currency's use beyond its initial retail applications.

The footage shows a female passenger becoming verbally abusive, using xenophobic language, and then kicking the driver in the head after he asked her to remove her feet from the car's center console. The incident occurred late at night after the driver picked up two women from a restaurant. The driver, who remained calm, later shared his story with a local news outlet.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected just six seconds into the NFL's season-opening game against the Dallas Cowboys. The rookie, who was the ninth overall pick in the 2023 draft, was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct after spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. The incident resulted in a 15-yard penalty for the Eagles, and Dallas subsequently scored a touchdown on the opening drive. The ejection occurred moments after the Eagles held a pregame Super Bowl championship celebration.</p>

The administration argues the original name, used until 1947, better projects strength and a "warrior ethos," while critics point to the significant cost and potential contradiction with peace-seeking efforts.</p>

The party's success is rooted in its ability to capture the support of 2016 Leave voters by focusing on socially conservative issues like immigration, equalities policies, and climate change skepticism. While dissatisfaction with the main parties is a factor, Reform's future depends on leader Nigel Farage's continued appeal and its ability to compete with the Conservatives for this specific voter base.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, suggested that businesses are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers—which can autonomously perform tasks like booking travel—without robust enterprise-grade security controls. In an interview, he warned that these AI agents would require user credentials and autonomy, creating a conflict with corporate security protocols designed to protect sensitive information. Arora emphasized the importance of identity security, noting that most breaches stem from credential theft, a risk that autonomous AI could exacerbate within an enterprise environment.</p>
