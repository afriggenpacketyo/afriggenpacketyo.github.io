          <p>The British government is set to announce a significant climbdown on its proposed welfare reforms following a rebellion from over 100 Labour Party backbenchers. To avoid a potential defeat in Parliament, the government is expected to agree that existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not see their benefits reduced. This concession addresses major concerns from MPs who criticized the plan to tighten eligibility for disability and sickness benefits, which was originally intended to save Â£5 billion annually.</p>

          <p>The White House is actively promoting its cornerstone legislative package, dubbed the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," as it faces significant obstacles and internal Republican disagreements in the Senate. The legislation, which addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, is being complicated by disputes over provisions like Medicaid restrictions. Further complicating its path, the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that key measures, including a provider tax plan, violate the Byrd Rule, requiring a 60-vote threshold that Republicans are struggling to meet ahead of their self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>

Iranian officials also stated that no new negotiations with the U.S. have been scheduled, emphasizing that future talks will be more difficult.</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have publicly questioned the Trump administration's claims that recent military strikes resulted in the "total obliteration" of Iran's nuclear facilities. Senators including Chris Murphy and Mark Warner expressed concern that the president was misleading the public, citing assessments that the strikes only set back Iran's program by months, not years. They argued that significant capability and knowledge remain, and that a final, conclusive battle damage assessment is still needed to verify the administration's strong assertions of success.</p>

While the plot is seen as derivative of films like "The Terminator," the review praises director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor and its exploration of the blending of biological and synthetic beings.

          <p>Carolyn McCarthy, a former Democratic congresswoman from New York who became a leading national advocate for gun control, has died at the age of 81. A former nurse, McCarthy entered politics after her husband was killed and her son was severely wounded in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road mass shooting. She ran for Congress in 1996 on a gun control platform and dedicated her nearly two-decade career to fighting for stricter gun laws, becoming a prominent voice in the debate after each subsequent mass shooting.</p>

Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May and remains one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history, has consistently denied the allegations but stated he will accept the league's resolution to move forward.</p>
