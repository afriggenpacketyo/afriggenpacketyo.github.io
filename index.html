          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a 5% drop in premarket trading following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which fell short of analyst expectations for both revenue and net income. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, the company's net income significantly missed estimates, although it was still 279% higher compared to the previous year. The article points out that analysts had hoped that investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce would drive better results, but macroeconomic volatility and competition in China affected the company's performance.

This ruling comes amid a nationwide battle over the Alien Enemies Act, which Mr. Trump has used to rapidly expel hundreds of migrants.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East tour notably excludes Israel, signaling a potential shift in his approach to the region. While maintaining a pro-Israel stance, Trump seems less concerned with aligning US and Israeli interests, engaging in direct negotiations with Israel's adversaries. This approach, coupled with the rise of the "restrainer" wing in the Republican party, suggests a potential shift away from unconditional support for Israel, prioritizing US interests and regional stability.</p>

          <p>California's public higher education institutions, including UC and CSU, received some relief in Governor Newsom's revised budget plan, reducing the initial proposed cuts by more than half. The revised budget reflects an acknowledgment of the vital role higher education plays in the state's economy and workforce development, while also addressing budget shortfalls. Despite the reduced cuts, the universities still face challenges, including federal research funding reductions and rising costs, necessitating continued advocacy for additional support.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is considering a policy change to improve paid family leave for teachers, who currently lack access to state-paid leave programs. The resolution aims to address the challenges faced by teacher-parents, who often plan pregnancies around summer vacation to maximize their limited time off. By studying the reproductive health needs of employees and exploring options for paid leave and childcare support, LAUSD hopes to become a "district of choice" for teachers and improve staff retention.</p>
