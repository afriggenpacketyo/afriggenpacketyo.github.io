            <h2>Trump Administration Confuses Tariff Policy with Conflicting Statements</h2>

            <p>President Trump and his top aides created confusion regarding the administration's tariff plans, particularly concerning exemptions for electronic products. Initially, exemptions for reciprocal tariffs on electronics were announced, but Trump and Commerce Secretary Lutnick suggested these might be reversed soon. This uncertainty has caused concern among tech companies like Apple, which manufactures most of its products in China. Democratic lawmakers criticized these changes as causing chaos and undermining Trump's credibility, while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer attempted to clarify the situation by stating the supply chain is simply moving to the national security tariff regime.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare, particularly through ambient listening technology that transcribes doctor-patient conversations and compiles clinical notes in real-time. Dr. Daniel Kortsch from Denver Health reports that AI tools like Nabla have significantly reduced physician workload and improved doctor-patient interaction. This innovation addresses the projected shortage of physicians and reduces burnout, allowing doctors to focus more on patient engagement. While patients might be skeptical, tech companies emphasize physician control and checks and balances to ensure accuracy and appropriate care.</p>
