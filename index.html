          <p>Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game, a milestone achieved after a rigorous journey through the minor leagues since 2016. Her debut is not a public relations stunt but the result of officiating over 1,200 minor league games and earning her position through merit and perseverance. Pawol, a former all-conference catcher and member of a world champion U.S. softball team, follows in the footsteps of pioneers in other major sports. Her call-up represents a significant moment for baseball, demonstrating that dedication and skill can break long-standing barriers.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly stated he will not make any territorial concessions, a stance reiterated after Trump suggested a land swap could be part of a peace deal.

          <p>A police officer, identified as 33-year-old David Rose, was killed Friday during a shooting incident near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention campus in Atlanta. The suspected gunman, 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was also found dead at the scene after allegedly firing at CDC buildings. Investigators are reportedly exploring the theory that the shooter was motivated by beliefs that he had been made ill by the COVID-19 vaccine. The event has highlighted growing concerns about violence directed at healthcare professionals and institutions, a trend that has escalated since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators participated in an anti-immigration march in Nuneaton, England, part of a series of similar protests across the country. The event was sparked by a local council leader's unverified claim that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. The protest remained largely peaceful, though one arrest was made for threats of criminal damage, and a small group of counter-protesters was moved on by police. The incident has fueled a national debate, with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage calling for police to disclose the immigration status of criminal suspects.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were inspecting the facility near the Israeli border as part of a UN-backed effort to dismantle unauthorized armaments following a recent ceasefire with Israel. The incident occurs as the Lebanese government pushes for Hezbollah's disarmament by the end of the year, a move the Iran-backed group strongly opposes. This event underscores the volatile security situation in Lebanon and the significant challenge posed by Hezbollah's dual role as a powerful political party and a heavily armed militia.</p>

The match itself ended in a 1-1 draw, with United winning the subsequent penalty shootout thanks to a save by current keeper Altay Bayindir. The event reignited discussions among fans about the club's decision to replace de Gea, especially given the mixed performance of his successor, Andre Onana.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, August 15, to discuss a resolution to the war in Ukraine. The announcement came as a deadline Trump had set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed without new sanctions being imposed. Trump suggested a potential peace deal might involve a "swapping of territories," a complex proposition aimed at ending the long-standing conflict. The planned one-on-one meeting has raised concerns in Ukraine and among allies about potential deals being made without their direct involvement.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of modern partisan gerrymandering, tracing its roots to the Republican 'Redmap' project following the 2010 census. This strategy involved targeting key state legislative races to gain control of the redistricting process, which successfully locked in a significant GOP advantage in Congress and statehouses for a decade. The use of advanced mapping software and voter data allowed for the creation of extremely durable, non-competitive districts. While grassroots reforms and court challenges have had some success, the 2019 Supreme Court ruling that federal courts cannot block partisan gerrymandering has opened the door for new, aggressive map-drawing efforts.</p>

          <p>In a peculiar diplomatic gesture, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous Soviet-era award for the son of a senior CIA official who was killed while fighting with Russian forces in Ukraine. The Order of Lenin was given to a U.S. envoy to pass on for Michael Gloss, 21, the son of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina. Gloss, who reportedly had mental health issues, had enlisted with Russian forces in 2023 and expressed pro-Russian views online. This unusual event adds another strange layer to the complex U.S.-Russia relationship ahead of the planned presidential summit.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London's Parliament Square resulted in the arrest of at least 200 people for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. Protesters held signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to police systematically arresting those displaying the placards. The government banned the group in July, making any expression of support a criminal offense. Organizers from Defend Our Juries argue the mass arrests are an infringement on free speech, while the government maintains the ban is justified due to the group's history of criminal damage.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the issue of "highball" property tax assessments, where homes in lower-income and non-white neighborhoods are often overvalued, leading to disproportionately high tax bills. This problem may worsen as federal funding cuts to local governments could force municipalities to raise property taxes further to maintain essential services. Homeowners are advised to review their assessments for errors and file appeals if they believe their valuation is unfairly high. Data suggests that residents in higher-income areas are significantly more likely to appeal their taxes, highlighting a potential lack of awareness about the process in unfairly taxed communities.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has outlined a proposed settlement plan for survivors of clergy sexual abuse, establishing a "point system" to determine compensation. Under the plan, specific acts of abuse are assigned different point values, with an act of sexual assault being worth the most. The final monetary value of each point depends on the total settlement fund, estimated between $180 million and $235 million. The proposal has drawn criticism from some attorneys representing survivors, who are urging a "no" vote, creating uncertainty around the resolution of the archdiocese's five-year bankruptcy case.</p>

This posture typically involves internally rotated shoulders, a forward-jutting neck, and a slouched spine, which he calls a 'silent killer' for shoulder health. To counteract this, the article suggests several exercises aimed at strengthening the upper back and improving posture, including band pull-aparts, rear delt raises, and face pulls.

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square early Saturday morning left three people injured, including two teenagers and a 65-year-old man. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a restaurant before spilling out onto the street, where a gunman opened fire. All three victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The New York City Police Department has a 17-year-old suspect in custody and has recovered a firearm from the scene. The investigation is ongoing to determine the relationship between the suspect and the victims and the motive for the shooting.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has updated his guidance in a new book. He now suggests that a diversified portfolio can support a safe withdrawal rate closer to 4.7%, and potentially even higher for today's retirees. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and don't spend enough, and he encourages a more dynamic approach to get the most out of accumulated wealth. His refined strategy incorporates a wider range of assets and a "rising equity glide path" to enhance portfolio longevity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who became one of Europe's most famous artists, surpassing even Rembrandt and Vermeer in her lifetime. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and botanist, Ruysch specialized in 'bloemstilleven,' or flower still life, a genre she perfected over a nearly 70-year career. Her paintings are noted for their scientific accuracy, dramatic lighting, and inclusion of exotic blooms and insects, reflecting the global reach of the Dutch empire. A new exhibition seeks to re-establish her significance, showcasing her technical mastery and the complex layers of meaning within her work.</p>

          <p>A panel on 'Washington Week With The Atlantic' analyzed the upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, highlighting the significant shift in U.S. policy. Panelists noted that the Biden-era principle of "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine" has been abandoned, putting Kyiv in a difficult position as its future is negotiated without its presence at the table. This direct engagement between Trump and Putin is seen as a major diplomatic development, but it raises serious concerns about Ukraine's sovereignty being undermined by an agreement brokered between the two leaders. The discussion also touched upon the president's broader trade policies.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported an additional 11 deaths from malnutrition, bringing the total to 212, as a humanitarian crisis deepens. This comes as Israel's government approved a controversial plan to take full security control of Gaza City, reportedly setting a deadline of October 7, 2025, for its one million residents to evacuate south. The plan has been widely condemned by humanitarian agencies and world leaders, who fear it will cause immense suffering for a population already facing famine conditions.

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle is not a mystery at all, attributing the disappearances of ships and planes to simple probability and environmental factors. He argues that the high volume of traffic in the area means the number of incidents is statistically normal on a percentage basis, a view shared by Lloyd's of London and NOAA. Factors such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather, complex navigation around numerous islands, and potential magnetic compass anomalies offer logical explanations. The article suggests that while supernatural theories are more exciting, the reality is a combination of nature and human error.</p>
