          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and charged with obstruction for allegedly hindering immigration agents attempting to arrest a Mexican national facing misdemeanor battery charges. According to the FBI, Dugan became visibly angry upon learning of the agents' presence and instructed them to report to another office while she allegedly ushered the suspect toward an exit. The suspect, previously deported in 2013, was apprehended after a brief chase. Dugan's arrest has sparked partisan debate, with Democrats criticizing it as an attack on the judicial system and Republicans emphasizing the importance of cooperating with law enforcement.

          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters perceive President Trump's expansion of executive power as excessive and harbor significant doubts about key aspects of his agenda. The early months of Trump's administration are described by majorities as "chaotic" and "scary," even among some supporters. Voters express diminishing confidence in his handling of critical issues such as the economy and immigration, despite broad support for deportations. The poll indicates a 42% approval rating for Trump, historically low for a president at this stage in their term. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Former Republican congressman George Santos has been sentenced to over seven years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft.

          <p>New research suggests that creatine, a common weightlifting supplement, may be a cheap and effective treatment for depression. Studies have shown that creatine can improve brain metabolism and ease depression symptoms, particularly when used in conjunction with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. A recent study in India indicated that creatine may be helpful even without antidepressants, offering a potentially more accessible treatment option for low-income patients. While researchers emphasize the preliminary nature of these findings, they highlight the potential of creatine as a valuable tool in mental health treatment. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly seeking to "right the ship" at the Pentagon by appointing new senior staff amidst Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth facing scrutiny for insecure handling of military plans. Internal conflicts and allegations of leaks have led to multiple resignations and firings, prompting the White House to search for experienced advisors. The new appointees, including Col. Ricky Buria and Justin Fulcher, have limited government experience, raising concerns about their ability to navigate the Pentagon's complex operations.

          <p>Recent British studies have linked exposure to air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, to declining cognitive performance in older adults. Researchers found associations between ambient air pollution levels and lower levels of overall and executive brain function. The studies suggest that pollutants in the bloodstream may affect areas of the brain responsible for sensory information, language, memory, and emotions. Measures to reduce transport pollution, such as London's low emission zones, have shown some success in cutting pollution and improving health-related economic factors. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>China is reportedly considering lifting sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) as part of a "charm offensive" to improve relations with the EU amid global trade uncertainties. The sanctions were imposed in 2021 after the EU sanctioned Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Experts believe the move could pave the way for trade discussions and a potential EU-China summit, but significant constraints remain due to Beijing's ties to Moscow and EU concerns over human rights.
