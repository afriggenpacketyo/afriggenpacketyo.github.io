          <p>Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to cash-paying patients in the U.S., a significant reduction from its list price of nearly $1,350. This move comes amid increasing political pressure on pharmaceutical companies to lower medication costs. The discounted price will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, aiming to expand access for uninsured or underinsured individuals with Type 2 diabetes. The company hopes this will also deter patients from using potentially unsafe compounded alternatives.</p>

          <p>Two police officers were killed and a third was wounded in Tremonton, Utah, after responding to a domestic disturbance call. The incident occurred when an officer was speaking to someone at a residence and a man emerged with a gun, opening fire. A second responding officer was also immediately shot and killed by the same suspect. Bystanders reportedly convinced the gunman to surrender his weapon before he was taken into custody by additional police units. Authorities described domestic disturbance calls as among the most dangerous situations for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prevent student loan forgiveness for individuals employed by organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values." This change to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which cancels federal student loans for public servants after 10 years of payments, has drawn criticism from advocates. They argue the vague language could be used to exclude employees of any non-profit organization the administration disapproves of. The Department of Education acknowledged the rule change may delay or prevent forgiveness for some borrowers.</p>

Dean Smith, 51, and Stuart Williams, 36, pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court for their involvement in the incident on July 17. The judge has warned them that they will likely face jail time when they are sentenced in October. The protests followed the arrest of a hotel resident who was subsequently charged with sexual assault, leading to significant local unrest and numerous other arrests.</p>

While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the United States, the National Hurricane Center warns it will bring "life-threatening surf and rip currents" to the East Coast throughout the week. The storm's large size means coastal areas will experience dangerous conditions, including high waves, prompting mandatory evacuations for parts of North Carolina's Hatteras Island.

          <p>Germany's top soccer league, the Bundesliga, is facing concerns that it is falling behind competitors like England's Premier League and Spain's La Liga. The league has seen an exodus of star players and has struggled for major international titles, with only two wins in the last decade. Financially, the Bundesliga's revenue is significantly lower than that of the Premier League, which also now leads in television rights revenue and average stadium attendance. Critics, including former players, argue that German soccer must address these issues to avoid further decline in its international standing.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear energy startup Kairos Power have announced a plan to deploy an advanced nuclear plant on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor will provide up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power for Google's regional data centers, which are increasingly power-hungry due to AI demands. In a novel arrangement, Google and Kairos will bear the financial risk of building the first-of-a-kind plant, while TVA will provide a revenue stream by purchasing the power. This model aims to overcome the cost overruns that have historically stalled nuclear construction in the U.S.</p>

It posits that proposed security guarantees from Europe would be fraught with peril without a firm U.S. commitment, which seems unlikely.

          <p>As diplomatic talks continue, this article provides context on the Ukrainian territories central to the debate over potential concessions to Russia. It details the geopolitical and military significance of the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which form a crucial defensive "fortress belt" for Ukraine. The analysis also covers the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Both the Russian and Ukrainian constitutions present legal and political obstacles to ceding territory, complicating any potential agreement.</p>

          <h2>Trump Advisor Peter Navarro Urges India to Cease 'Opportunistic' Russian Oil Purchases</h2>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Donald Trump, has publicly called on India to stop purchasing Russian crude oil, labeling the practice as "opportunistic." In an op-ed, Navarro argued that India is undermining international sanctions designed to isolate Russia's economy and that it needs to act like a strategic partner to the U.S. His comments come as the Trump administration plans to impose additional tariffs on India over its Russian oil trade. India has defended its imports as a necessity to ensure affordable energy for its citizens.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister of Qatar and the President of Egypt met to discuss ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, as Israel's offensive intensifies. Both leaders affirmed their shared goal of reaching a truce and stated their rejection of any reoccupation of the Gaza Strip or displacement of Palestinians. This high-level meeting coincides with reports of intensive discussions in Egypt between mediators and a Hamas delegation. Despite these diplomatic efforts, which are also supported by the U.S., a lasting ceasefire has remained elusive amid the deepening humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a residential apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine, killed at least seven people, including two children. The attack occurred overnight as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to travel to Washington for peace talks with President Trump. Ukrainian officials condemned the strike as a "demonstrative and cynical" act by Russia, intended to apply pressure and humiliate diplomatic efforts. The attack was part of a broader wave of 140 drones and several missiles launched by Russia across multiple Ukrainian regions.</p>

This makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class drug authorized for MASH, significantly expanding its applications beyond weight loss and diabetes management. The decision was based on a trial where Wegovy showed superior improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo, boosting the company's shares.</p>

Meanwhile, Arsenal showcased a new, more direct and transitional style of play against Manchester United, a departure from their previous methodical possession game. The article suggests that how these teams balance their new approaches will be a critical factor in their success this season.</p>

          <p>A new trend dubbed "job hugging" is emerging in the labor market, as workers increasingly hold onto their current positions amid economic and political uncertainty. This marks a significant shift from the "great resignation" of 2021-2022, which saw historic rates of job-hopping. The rate at which workers are voluntarily quitting their jobs is now near its lowest point in years, reflecting anxiety about finding new employment in a cooling job market. While providing stability, experts warn that this stagnation could limit wage growth and make it harder for new entrants to find work. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the transition is causing distress among some entrepreneurs, who will face higher taxes and the added costs of new accounting systems and training.
