        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is pushing for the National Guard's deployment to San Francisco, a move met with strong opposition from local officials, including Mayor Daniel Lurie. This comes as the city is undergoing a significant post-pandemic resurgence, largely fueled by the booming artificial intelligence industry, with venture capital funding expected to surpass previous records. Crime rates have reportedly decreased, and tourism and real estate markets are showing recovery. While Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially supported Trump's call, he later reversed his position after facing criticism. Mayor Lurie emphasizes that existing law enforcement partnerships are sufficient and that federal troops lack the authority to address local drug crimes effectively, framing the city's progress as a testament to local efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith has openly expressed his strong dislike for NBA star LeBron James, stemming from a decade-long personal rivalry and a recent courtside incident. Smith recounted on Carmelo Anthony's podcast that he felt "set up" by James during a viral confrontation at a Lakers game, where James seemingly confronted him over critiques of his son, Bronny. The timing of the interaction, coinciding with Smith's ESPN contract announcement, and the specific camera angle used, led Smith to believe it was orchestrated. He further alleged that James has actively attempted to hinder his career over the years, indicating a significant and unresolved animosity between the two high-profile figures in the sports world.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced the recovery of its services following a major, day-long outage that severely impacted numerous prominent websites and online applications. The disruption originated in AWS's primary US-East-1 region, causing increased error rates for various services, including its crucial DynamoDB database. Companies such as Disney+, Lyft, Reddit, and even Amazon's own operations experienced significant problems, with some services still processing backlogs. This widespread incident highlights the profound dependency of global digital infrastructure on a few dominant cloud providers like AWS, underscoring the potential for a single technical issue to trigger extensive cascading failures across the internet.</p>

          <p>The "No Kings" protests, drawing millions nationwide, represent a significant surge in American civic participation, particularly in opposition to President Trump's perceived authoritarianism. These demonstrations, occurring across diverse towns and cities, provide an outlet for citizens apprehensive about current policies and aim to sustain momentum through future elections. The article highlights that these protests, despite not causing immediate political change, challenge the perception of Trump's invincibility and send a message to political and corporate entities considering alignment with his administration. Trump's own reactions, including threatening the Insurrection Act and posting an inflammatory AI video, underscore the impact these popular movements are having.</p>

          <h2>States Caution Against Potential Suspension of SNAP Benefits Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown</h2>

          <p>Several states are warning that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly known as food stamps, may be halted in November if the federal government shutdown persists. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) informed state agencies that funds would be insufficient to cover full November benefits without appropriations. This situation affects over 40 million Americans who rely on SNAP, with advocates fearing devastating consequences for vulnerable populations. The USDA possesses contingency funds that could potentially cover costs, as was done in previous shutdowns, but it remains unclear if the current administration will utilize them, making this a critical policy choice with significant social impact.</p>

          <p>Atlanta police successfully averted a potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, thanks to a crucial tip from the suspect's family. Billy Cagle, 49, was arrested inside the South Terminal after his family reported he was livestreaming threats to "shoot it up" at the airport. Officers located an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside. Authorities believe Cagle, a felon with mental health issues, was scouting the terminal before retrieving his weapon. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens praised the collaboration between community and law enforcement for preventing a tragedy, emphasizing the dangers when mental health and firearms intersect.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, during her high-profile Massachusetts retrial. The jury, however, convicted her of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case, which saw a previous mistrial, involved Read being accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him, while her defense claimed an elaborate cover-up by law enforcement and others. Key disputes included the timing of a "how long to die in cold" Google search and the integrity of the investigation, particularly concerning former State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, who was later fired for misconduct. The verdict concludes a lengthy and contentious legal battle that garnered significant public attention.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett predicted that the government shutdown, now in its third week, is likely to conclude by the end of this week. He suggested that if Democrats do not cooperate, the Trump administration might implement "stronger measures" to force a resolution. The shutdown stems from a partisan battle over federal funding, with Republicans pushing for a short-term bill and Democrats insisting on including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett speculated that Democrats might be delaying a vote to reopen the government until after the nationwide "No Kings" protests, aiming for better political optics.

Following a dismal 2-0 defeat to Brentford, fans booed the team and many seats remained empty due to ongoing protests against chairman David Sullivan and vice-chair Karren Brady. Supporters are boycotting matches over unkept promises, lack of squad strengthening, and a poor matchday experience since the club's move from Upton Park. Nuno admits the players must deliver performances that "please them and they can support us and give us energy," recognizing the deep-seated anger and anxiety among the club's faithful.</p>

While younger generations show more optimism for long-term growth, they are also more fearful of a potential recession.

          <p>China's ambitious "AI+" initiative, initially seen as an economic stimulus, is now revealed to be a comprehensive plan for multidimensional societal transformation by 2035. Official analyses in E-Government journal indicate the plan aims to reshape politics, economy, society, science, and technology, promising citizens "infinite hope" with innovations like robot companions and even robot children. Despite these optimistic projections, the government and its advisors are actively addressing significant potential risks, including mass unemployment, erosion of family structures, human-machine conflicts, ethical upheavals, and increased social inequality. This article outlines China's bold vision for an AI-integrated future and its proactive approach to managing the associated challenges.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey announced that European troops are "ready to deploy" to Ukraine within weeks, contingent on a ceasefire agreement between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This readiness stems from six months of planning by a "coalition of the willing" alliance of 26 European nations. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not invited to the planned Trump-Putin meeting, Healey stressed that Ukraine must dictate peace terms. The announcement follows reports of a contentious White House meeting where Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to cede territory. Healey also warned of a "new era of threat" in Europe, with Russia viewing Britain as its "number one enemy."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report has revealed that a substandard cable was responsible for the deadly Lisbon funicular crash in September, which killed 16 people and injured 21. The investigation by the Office for Air and Rail Accident Prevention and Investigation (GPIAAF) found that the haulage cable, in use for less than a year, did not meet the city's transport operator specifications. The cable's failure led to the top car hurtling down the hill, and subsequent safety system failures meant the pneumatic brake was inoperable and the manual brake insufficient. All other city funiculars remain suspended as inspectors verify braking systems, highlighting critical safety oversights in public transport infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Demolition has reportedly begun on a section of the White House East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump's ambitious $250 million ballroom. Trump announced the "fully modernised" project, claiming it's privately funded by "generous Patriots" and will not interfere with the existing historic structure. Photos show construction crews tearing down parts of a covered entryway and windows, sparking widespread criticism, with one former lawmaker calling it an "utter desecration." The new venue is planned to be 90,000 square feet, accommodating up to 650 people, with bulletproof glass, and is expected to be completed before the end of Trump's second term.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the West, particularly the U.S., risks war with China by viewing its rise through a "mirror" of its own historical conquest and rivalry. The author criticizes Graham Allison's "Thucydides Trap" framework for projecting Western aggression onto China, suggesting it ignores China's distinct 5,000-year, land-bound cultural DNA. Historically, Chinese civilization thrived by defending its agricultural heartlands, fostering a defensive rather than expansionist ethos, unlike the nomadic tribes or European empires. To avert conflict, the article advocates for the West to "shatter this mirror" and develop a more nuanced understanding of China's unique historical and cultural motivations, rather than assuming inevitable aggression.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan to double the ICE workforce is facing significant hurdles, as over a third of new recruits are failing the agency's personal-fitness test. Requirements, including 15 push-ups and a 1.5-mile run in 14 minutes, are proving too challenging for many "athletically allergic candidates" who misrepresented their physical condition. This high failure rate is impeding the goal of deploying 10,000 deportation officers by January, raising concerns among veteran officials about the quality of new hires. The article highlights that despite eased standards and a $50,000 hiring bonus, the agency is struggling with recruits who lack the physical capabilities for street operations, leading to logistical and legal "disasters."</p>

          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC or CBD, are experiencing a surge in popularity as more Americans opt to reduce their alcohol intake. This market shift is driven by a declining percentage of U.S. adults consuming alcohol, with many seeking nonalcoholic alternatives that offer zero calories or sugar. THC beverage sales are projected to grow significantly, attracting major retailers like Target and existing alcohol brands. Doctors, however, caution about potential side effects such including anxiety, paranoia, and impaired cognitive function, particularly for teens and those with pre-existing conditions. The article details the evolving regulatory landscape, with these drinks legally available in many states, and highlights their appeal to women seeking less caloric options.

The exhibition, "Monuments," displays melted-down bronze and graffitied equestrian statues alongside contemporary art, prompting a re-evaluation of American history.

Data from Antenna indicates Disney+ lost approximately three million subscribers, while Hulu saw over four million cancellations. Kimmel's suspension followed pressure from a federal regulator after his comments on a shooting incident, sparking widespread free speech debates and calls for a boycott against Disney. Although Kimmel was reinstated within a week due to backlash, the incident, coupled with previously planned subscription price increases, suggests a financial impact on the entertainment giant.
