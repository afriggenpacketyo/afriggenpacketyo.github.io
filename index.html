The new rules, obtained by the Guardian, also apply to psychologists, dentists and a host of other occupations. While medical staff are still required to treat veterans regardless of race, color, religion and sex, and all veterans remain entitled to treatment, individual workers are now free to decline to care for patients based on personal characteristics not explicitly prohibited by federal law.

          <p>Assisted stretching is gaining popularity, with studios like StretchLab and Stretch Zone proliferating. These studios employ “flexologists” who guide clients through deep stretches to improve flexibility, mobility, and posture. While not medical professionals, these practitioners use techniques like PNF stretching to help clients isolate asymmetries and alleviate stiffness. Although the benefits of stretching are debated in the sports medicine community, consistent assisted stretching may offer pain relief and injury prevention. The article explores the trend of assisted stretching and its potential benefits and limitations.</p>

          <p>Despite facing constant challenges and criticism, California remains committed to its high-speed rail project due to several key social issues, including traffic congestion, affordable housing, and climate change. The project aims to provide a faster and more sustainable transportation option for Californians, connecting major urban centers and fostering economic development in the Central Valley. High-speed rail is also seen as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the state's housing crisis by enabling people to commute from more affordable areas.

It introduces Donna's Law, or the Voluntary Do-Not-Sell List, as an innovative tool to protect individuals against impulsive gun purchases during suicidal crises. Currently available in a limited number of states, this law allows individuals to voluntarily and confidentially suspend their ability to buy a gun. The article advocates for the expansion of Donna's Law to provide more ways for mass shooting survivors to protect themselves against suicide.</p>

          <p>A new, highly contagious COVID-19 subvariant, nicknamed “Nimbus,” is spreading in California, with patients reporting symptoms of an intensely painful sore throat, described as feeling like their throats are studded with razor blades. The Nimbus subvariant, part of the Omicron family, is becoming increasingly dominant nationally and is projected to comprise a significant portion of circulating virus in California. Health officials are also observing increased COVID-19 activity through wastewater surveillance and test positivity rates. This comes as some medical professionals object to recent moves by the Trump administration on vaccine policy, which they fear will make it more difficult for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This article discusses the spread of a new COVID subvariant and related concerns about vaccine access.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is facing criticism for delaying the implementation of multilingual wireless emergency alerts, which would provide crucial information in 13 languages and American Sign Language. Despite unanimous approval and backing from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr in 2023, the report and order necessary to initiate the 30-month update period for wireless providers has not been published in the Federal Register. Congress members and nonprofits argue that the delay, potentially due to a Trump administration executive order, denies millions access to potentially life-saving information in their native languages.

          <p>Scotland's ban on biodegradable waste in landfills, set to begin at the end of the year, will result in up to 100 truckloads of waste being exported to England daily, according to experts.

While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfills, the transportation of waste will lead to a temporary increase in emissions.
