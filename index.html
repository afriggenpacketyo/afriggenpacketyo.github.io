        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses how President Trump's administration and family have been accused of engaging in pay-to-play schemes with foreign entities, reminiscent of past administrations. The article notes that while Trump's actions may seem unprecedented, previous administrations, including the Clinton Foundation, have faced similar scrutiny for accepting funds from foreign regimes. The author argues that American politicians have long been susceptible to foreign influence and that comprehensive legislation is needed to prevent such corruption, including barring family members of politicians from foreign lobbying and investments. Ultimately, the article suggests that dismantling corruption requires a multi-faceted approach that holds all parties accountable. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article contrasts the diverging paths of night train travel in Europe and the United States. While Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train networks, driven by environmental concerns and increased investment, the United States continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting its rail infrastructure. The article argues that America's car dependence has negatively impacted happiness and mental health, and that investing in rail networks could offer a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative. The author urges the United States to rediscover the American dream through revitalized railways, promoting connection and shared purpose. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to the arrest and conviction of Jerry Westrom for the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs.

The forensic analysis of the footprints confirmed that Westrom was present during the murder.
