          <h2>Pakistan Airspace Closure Impacts Indian Airline Routes and Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 00:58:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's airspace closure to Indian airlines is causing flight route alterations and increased costs for carriers flying to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Airlines like Air India and IndiGo face longer flight times, potential refueling stops, and route cancellations. While some routes to Almaty and Tashkent are temporarily suspended, the overall impact on airfares may be minimal, according to analysts. The closure stems from heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following a recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir. Optimism that the impact will be minimal stems from the idea that the closure is more symbolic than significantly disruptive.</p>

The US asserts its actions aim to end the Houthi threat to shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, while the Houthis claim their attacks are in support of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Homan denied reports of other U.S. citizen children being deported, asserting that the mothers made the decision for their children to accompany them. This comes amid increasing scrutiny of the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, which have led to court battles and concerns over due process.

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency, of lying to the Supreme Court. This accusation is the latest development in a legal dispute over Netanyahu’s attempt to fire Bar, with the prime minister claiming a lack of trust as the reason. Bar has alleged that the decision to remove him was based on expectations of personal loyalty rather than professional considerations. The case has been brought by Israeli watchdog organizations and opposition parties.</p>
