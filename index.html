          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has denounced the Trump administration's intention to federalize 300 National Guard members to manage protests near a Broadview ICE facility. Pritzker described the move as an ultimatum, calling it an "outrageous and un-American" act of aggression against his state's people. The White House confirmed the plan, stating it was necessary to protect federal assets amidst what it termed "violent riots and lawlessness." The governor maintains that state and local law enforcement have the situation under control and that federal military intervention is a manufactured political performance, not a genuine public safety effort.</p>

          <p>Milan Mandaric, the Serbian-American businessman known for owning English football clubs Portsmouth, Leicester City, and Sheffield Wednesday, has passed away at 87. Remembered as a charismatic figure, Mandaric earned a reputation as football's "Mr. Fixit" for rescuing clubs from financial distress and leading them to success, such as Portsmouth's 2003 Championship title. He began his career in his family's engineering business in Yugoslavia before moving to the United States and eventually becoming a prominent figure in European football. All three of his former English clubs released statements mourning his loss and praising his significant contributions.</p>

The victims were found dead in May in the Tonto National Forest after failing to return from a camping trip. Investigators allege Brown, who was also camping in the area, provided false and misleading information about his encounter with the teens, whom he did not know. At a press conference, Kjolsrud's mother described her daughter as a "beautiful, brilliant light" and stated the darkness of the crime will not define her life.</p>

          <p>As the United States, the primary architect and financial contributor to the United Nations, increasingly steps back from the multilateral system, a potential power vacuum is emerging. This retreat from the global stage, which the U.S. helped establish after World War II, may create significant opportunities for other nations, such as China, to expand their influence within the organization. The shift marks a critical juncture for the UN, which has long relied on American leadership and funding to drive its international initiatives. The long-term consequences of this changing dynamic on global diplomacy and cooperation remain a key point of observation.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square with a renewed sense of hope following Hamas's acceptance of a ceasefire proposal brokered by President Trump. Protesters expressed gratitude toward the U.S. president for achieving a breakthrough that they feel their own government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, could not. The 20-point plan involves the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

          <p>An explosion and fire at Chevron's El Segundo refinery have raised alarms among local communities and environmental advocates, pointing to the facility's extensive history of safety and environmental violations. The incident is unlikely to be investigated by key federal agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board due to the ongoing government shutdown, sparking fears that the root cause may never be identified. Public records show the refinery has received numerous citations for violations, including a recent one for a large chemical leak. This event underscores the inherent dangers of refinery operations and the critical need for regulatory oversight.</p>

His comments follow Hamas's partial acceptance of the U.S. plan, though the group did not agree to disarm.

The proposal includes a ban preventing anyone who enters the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and would replace court appeals with an internal Home Office process. To execute this, the party plans to rebrand the immigration enforcement unit as a "Removals Force" with doubled funding and expanded powers.

A human rights group identified the executed men as Arab political prisoners who were subjected to severe torture, highlighting ongoing concerns about discrimination against the Arab population in the region.</p>

          <p>In an interview, former President Donald Trump claimed that a peace deal to end the conflict in Gaza is "very close" to being finalized. He recounted telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the proposed 20-point plan was his "chance for victory" and that he had "no choice" but to accept it. Despite Trump's optimism and his call for Israel to halt its bombing campaign, Israeli airstrikes reportedly continued in Gaza. Trump asserted that his plan has received global support and that he intends to help rehabilitate Israel's international image, which he says has suffered during the war.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia's attorney general, is facing bipartisan backlash after text messages from 2022 surfaced in which he used violent and inflammatory language about a Republican colleague. In the texts, Jones mused about hypothetically shooting then-Speaker Todd Gilbert, writing Gilbert would get "two bullets to the head." Jones has since issued a deep apology, calling his words embarrassing and shameful. Both his Democratic running mate for governor, Abigail Spanberger, and his Republican opponents have strongly condemned the remarks, with some calling for him to drop out of the race.</p>

          <p>Goalkeeper Senne Lammens made an impressive debut for Manchester United, keeping a clean sheet and making two crucial saves in a victory over Sunderland. The 23-year-old Belgian, a recent £18.1 million signing, earned a serenade from the Old Trafford faithful, who humorously chanted "are you Schmeichel in disguise?" His confident performance provided a much-needed positive sign for the club, which has struggled with its goalkeeping situation this season. While just one game, his solid start offers hope that he could be a reliable long-term option for the team.</p>

          <p>Turkey is performing a difficult balancing act, managing its heavy dependence on Russian energy while facing pressure from the U.S. to reduce these ties. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Turkey has increased its intake of discounted Russian oil and gas, which now constitute over half of its imports. In response to U.S. demands, Turkey is not cutting off Russian supplies but is instead pursuing a strategy of diversification. The state-owned energy company recently announced long-term liquified natural gas (LNG) contracts with American and Australian firms, signaling a quiet shift to expand its energy sources and ensure long-term security.</p>

          <p>The Jack Daniel’s distillery in Tennessee is ending its decades-long practice of providing a free grain byproduct, known as stillage, to local cattle farmers for feed. The company is redirecting the waste to a new anaerobic digester facility to generate renewable energy and meet global sustainability goals. This decision has devastated local farmers in Moore County, many of whom built their operations around this free resource and now face financial ruin. The move highlights a growing tension between corporate environmental objectives and the economic survival of the rural communities that support these large brands.</p>

          <p>The sale of traditional acoustic pianos has plummeted in recent years, reflecting a significant cultural and economic shift. Industry experts note that millennials struggling with housing costs are less likely to purchase a large, expensive instrument. In response, the market has seen a surge in the popularity of digital and hybrid pianos, which offer more affordable and compact alternatives. While sales of acoustic pianos are down, the instrument continues to find a place in homes, with technicians optimistic that players who start on digital versions may eventually seek the richer musicality of an acoustic piano.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has had a frustrating start to the season, culminating in an unfortunate and unprecedented record. After being substituted just 30 minutes into the match against West Ham due to a knee injury, he became the first player in Premier League history to be taken off before halftime in three consecutive starts. His previous early exits were caused by a recurring shoulder issue. The string of injuries has limited the influential Norwegian playmaker's time on the pitch, creating a significant challenge for manager Mikel Arteta and the team's attacking dynamics.</p>

While some drivers like George Russell plan to use the system, reigning champion Max Verstappen has criticized it, stating he will not wear it due to discomfort and design flaws. Verstappen argued that its use should be a driver's personal choice, not a mandatory safety measure. The controversy highlights the challenges of implementing new technology in the tight confines of an F1 cockpit under extreme racing conditions.</p>

One side of the proposed coin shows Trump's profile, while the reverse depicts him with a clenched fist, referencing his exclamation of "Fight, Fight, Fight!" immediately after surviving an assassination attempt. While a Treasury spokesperson noted the design is not final, they said it reflects the "enduring spirit of our country." The proposal is highly unusual, as federal law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on U.S. currency.</p>

          <p>Anti-government protests in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, escalated as demonstrators clashed with police while trying to storm the presidential palace. Security forces deployed water cannons and pepper spray to disperse the crowds, which had gathered to protest the ruling Georgian Dream party. The country has been in a political crisis since last year's disputed parliamentary election, which the opposition claims was stolen. The protest, held on the day of local elections largely boycotted by the opposition, saw tens of thousands waving Georgian and EU flags amid calls for the arrest of ruling party leaders.</p>
