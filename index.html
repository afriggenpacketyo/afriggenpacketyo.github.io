          <p>Antoine Massey, one of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago, has been arrested in New Orleans. The manhunt, involving multiple law enforcement agencies, has now led to the recapture of nine escapees, with only one, Derrick Groves, still at large. The escape, which involved exploiting a faulty cell door, has drawn criticism towards the jail's management, and authorities have arrested at least 16 individuals accused of aiding the fugitives. A $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final inmate's capture.</p>

          <p>A former assistant pastor in Oxnard, California, has been sentenced to two years in prison for stealing $200,000 from his church. Curtis Frank Lemons admitted to issuing himself a fraudulent check while the church's founder was dying and used the funds for personal expenses, including a new home in Tennessee. The theft was reported by a church member, and despite initially claiming he gave the money to charity, financial records proved otherwise.

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited the scope of nationwide injunctions, the ACLU and other legal groups have filed a new class-action lawsuit against President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The lawsuit argues that the order, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, is unconstitutional. While the Supreme Court did not rule on the legality of the order itself, its decision allows the policy to potentially take effect in some parts of the country. The new legal challenge aims to secure protections for all children who would be affected.</p>

          <p>In response to a Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, immigrant rights groups are adopting a new legal strategy by filing a national class-action lawsuit. This move aims to protect all individuals affected by President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. The original case did not see the Supreme Court rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, but on the power of lower court judges. Attorneys for the plaintiffs believe the class-action approach can provide complete relief and argue the executive order flagrantly violates the 14th Amendment.</p>

Newsom's legal team asserts that Fox News willfully distorted facts to support Trump and is demanding a retraction and on-air apology.

A project at the University of Southampton is actively collecting phage samples from the environment to test their effectiveness against patient infections.

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to bridge the social distance that grew between her and her classmates over the years. Feeling isolated by social anxiety, she spent over 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 students she used to be friends with in her younger years. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and prompted feelings of regret among her peers for not paying more attention to her.

          <p>A contemporary furniture store in Merriam, Kansas, is closing after four years in business, with the owner citing the financial strain of U.S. trade tariffs. Owner Henrik Svendsen stated that tariffs on imported goods, particularly from China, have made his inventory unaffordable for both his business and his customers. He has paid approximately $162,000 in tariffs and cannot absorb the rising costs, leading to the decision to liquidate the store and lay off ten employees. The situation illustrates the direct impact of national trade policy on local small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling it unconstitutional. This is the fourth such ruling against a series of presidential orders aimed at punishing prominent law firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. The orders imposed punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. In her decision, Judge Loren AliKhan stated the order violates the Constitution, a sentiment echoed by three other judges in similar cases involving different firms.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major U-turn on planned welfare cuts, avoiding a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs but raising serious questions about its fiscal strategy. The initial plan aimed to save billions by tightening eligibility for disability payments, a move critics called a short-term cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine long-term reform to address rising health-related benefit claims. The reversal, which could cost £3 billion, now forces the Chancellor to find savings elsewhere or raise taxes, undermining the government's pursuit of stability and credibility.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has rejected a resolution that would have limited President Trump's authority to use military force against Iran without congressional approval. The measure, which invoked the War Powers Act, failed in a 53-47 vote, falling short of the simple majority needed to advance. The vote occurred amid heightened tensions and a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Proponents of the resolution argued for congressional oversight on decisions of war, while opponents believed it was unnecessary at this time.</p>

          <p>A growing number of individuals are reporting debilitating, long-term withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing SSRI antidepressants, years after taking their last dose. These patients, who often connect through online forums, describe issues like nerve pain, severe anxiety, and sexual dysfunction that their doctors did not warn them about. While some academic psychiatrists acknowledge the existence of a severe serotonin withdrawal syndrome, there is little large-scale research on its long-term effects. Patient advocacy groups are now pushing for recognition and funding for research into the condition.</p>

          <p>A Riverside County man has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud related to the sale of memorabilia signed by Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee. Mac Martin Anderson, who had a personal relationship with Lee, sold autographed items to dealers and fans between 2015 and 2018. He earned over $1.2 million in proceeds from these sales but failed to report the income to the IRS. In addition to his prison sentence, Anderson has been ordered to pay more than $482,000 in restitution for the unpaid taxes.</p>
