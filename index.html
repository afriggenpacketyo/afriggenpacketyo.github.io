          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals mixed public opinion on President Trump's economic performance. While his 2024 voters largely express confidence, a significant portion harbors concerns about rising prices and the impact of tariffs.  The poll highlights a partisan divide, with Trump voters overwhelmingly approving of his handling of the economy, while overall approval is considerably lower.  Despite financial struggles, some voters remain optimistic about Trump's ability to improve the economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first 100 days have been marked by an unprecedented number of executive orders and declarations of national emergencies.
