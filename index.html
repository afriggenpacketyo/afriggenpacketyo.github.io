          <p>A significant 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting initial tsunami advisories for parts of Alaska's Aleutian Islands, which were later canceled. The governor of the Kamchatka region also issued a local tsunami warning, urging residents to be aware of the potential danger. Despite the powerful tremor, authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic event. Officials also stated there was no subsequent tsunami threat to other Pacific regions, including Hawaii and Canada.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man, who was being sought on stalking and trespassing charges, killed three police officers and wounded two others in York County, Pennsylvania. The gunman used an AR-15-style rifle to ambush the officers as they attempted to serve an arrest warrant at the home of his ex-girlfriend. The suspect was subsequently killed by police during the confrontation. This incident marks one of the deadliest days for law enforcement in the state's recent history, prompting calls from officials for better societal approaches to resolving disputes.</p>

          <p>Beijing's efforts to curb a damaging price war within China's solar-equipment industry are showing early signs of success, according to market analysts. Government-led initiatives, including proposed limits on power usage for manufacturing plants, have contributed to a recent rise in prices for solar products like polysilicon. This price recovery is expected to help leading manufacturers return to profitability after enduring 18 months of financial losses. The positive policy sentiment has already supported a 5 to 7 percent increase in prices for key solar components over the past month. (not investment advice)</p>

The man, Kellen McMiller, posed with the governor just days before his arrest in connection with a Louis Vuitton store burglary that resulted in the death of another driver during the getaway. At the time of the photo, McMiller reportedly had four outstanding arrest warrants. The governor's office expressed that they were "extremely troubled" by the situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed a block of 48 of President Trump's nominees simultaneously, utilizing new rules implemented by Republicans to overcome Democratic delays. The rule change allows for the confirmation of large groups of lower-level, non-judicial nominees with a simple majority vote, bypassing previous stalling tactics. Democrats had been forcing multiple votes on nearly every nominee, arguing the candidates were "historically bad," while Republicans aimed to clear a significant backlog of executive branch positions. This move represents the latest escalation in partisan battles over the nominations process.</p>

Enfabrica, which Nvidia had previously invested in, specializes in technology that can connect over 100,000 GPUs, enhancing Nvidia's ability to offer large-scale, integrated AI computing systems.

The situation arose after the FCC chairman made comments suggesting ABC should take action against Kimmel or face "additional work for the FCC."

          <p>Over a decade after early attempts like Google Glass failed to gain traction, major tech companies including Meta, Snap, and Google are once again competing to develop the next generation of smart glasses. This renewed race is fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence, which companies believe will make the devices more useful and integrated into daily life. Meta recently showcased its new AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses, while Snap plans to release powerful augmented reality glasses in 2026. Analysts predict significant market growth in the coming years, though consumer adoption remains a key challenge.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership is planning a Friday vote on a 52-day continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government and avert a shutdown ahead of the September 30 deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism about passing the measure, which he described as a clean, good-faith effort to allow appropriation work to continue. However, Democrats have signaled opposition, demanding the bill restore cuts to Medicaid and extend expiring Obamacare subsidies. With a slim majority, Republicans can only afford to lose a few votes, making passage uncertain.</p>

          <p>A Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing has drawn attention to what is being described as an emerging health crisis involving teenagers and generative AI chatbots. Parents testified that AI, which started as a homework helper for their children, allegedly transformed into a confidant and, in one case, a suicide coach. Lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI, alleging their products contributed to teen suicides and other harmful behaviors. In response, OpenAI announced it is developing an age-prediction system and will implement parental controls to enhance teen safety.</p>

          <p>The indefinite suspension of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has triggered calls for a public boycott against its parent company, Disney. The suspension followed a complaint from the FCC chairman regarding Kimmel's monologue about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Activist groups are circulating boycott guides online, framing the network's decision as state-sanctioned censorship resulting from government pressure on a media conglomerate. The calls to action urge the public to contact ABC and its major affiliate owners to protest the move as a violation of free speech.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, a government crackdown on his critics has ignited a national battle over the limits of free speech. Administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, have vowed to prosecute "hate speech," while the State Department has threatened to revoke visas over social media posts celebrating Kirk's death. This response, coupled with pressure leading to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, has alarmed legal experts. They argue that while such speech may be offensive, it is generally protected by the First Amendment, and the government's actions set a dangerous precedent for censorship.</p>

          <p>In an interview at The Atlantic Festival, former Vice President Mike Pence addressed several current political issues, including the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. Pence distinguished between government censorship and a private employer's right to dismiss an employee for their comments, though he stated he would have preferred the FCC chairman not to have weighed in. He also expressed hope that the Republican Party will eventually return to its traditional conservative roots after President Trump leaves the political stage. Pence reflected on his relationship with Trump, noting their profound disagreement over January 6th but affirming that he has forgiven him.</p>

This follows a week of administration rhetoric against "radical left political violence" in the wake of the deadly shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. It remains unclear what the legal implications of such a designation would be, as antifa is not considered a formally organized group.</p>

The team, which has led Major League Baseball in attendance every year since 2013, will officially cross the threshold during their final regular season game. This achievement is a rarity in modern baseball, as no team has reached the 4-million mark since 2008, largely due to smaller modern stadium capacities. The Dodgers' on-field success and the addition of global superstar Shohei Ohtani have been credited with boosting attendance to this record level.</p>

The rule mandates that press releases, social media content, and even direct outreach to the Board of Supervisors be reviewed by the board's executive office. Critics, including members of commissions that oversee county jails and the Sheriff's Department, argue the policy is an attempt to limit independent oversight and muzzle criticism. County officials maintain the policy was created to ensure consistent messaging and avoid misinformation.</p>
