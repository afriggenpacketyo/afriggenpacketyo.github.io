          <p>A pivotal and controversial call during the Auburn versus Georgia college football game has ignited a significant debate among fans and on social media. Auburn quarterback Jackson Arnold appeared to cross the goal line for a touchdown, but officials ruled he fumbled the ball just before scoring. The turnover prevented Auburn from taking a 16-0 lead and instead catalyzed a comeback for Georgia, who went on to win 20-10. The call proved to be the major turning point of the game.</p>

          <p>Border Patrol agents are increasingly being deployed in major U.S. cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, far from the nation's borders, as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation strategy.

The agency's authority extends up to 100 miles from any international boundary, which includes most major cities, but their recent expansion into these zones marks a significant shift.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a public warning to staff in propaganda departments and classified units about leaking confidential information to the media. The agency cited several past instances where news reports led to the disclosure of state secrets. The warning emphasized the need for stricter confidentiality reviews before media interviews, noting that public-facing information is often scrutinized by "external forces." The article highlights the government's concern that some media workers prioritize publicity over national security.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, was not involved in the substance or evidence of the recently collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped after prosecutors said the government failed to provide necessary evidence, prompting criticism from Conservative MPs who suggested Powell was responsible. The Director of Public Prosecutions specified the trial could not proceed because the government did not supply evidence classifying China as a national security threat.</p>

          <p>Estonia has closed a road that its citizens commonly use even though it passes through a small section of Russian territory known as the Saatse Boot. The decision was made after Estonian border guards observed a larger-than-usual group of Russian soldiers standing in the area. While Russian patrols are normal, their position on the road was considered unusual and prompted the closure to ensure citizen safety and prevent potential incidents. The Estonian Interior Minister stated there is no direct threat of war, but the road will remain closed.</p>

The mayor emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers would be treated equally in government procurement processes. The policy aims to encourage foreign participation in building supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-transgender stance. The author argues it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting the books' core message of rejecting supremacy is valuable, even if flawed. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests fans should actively and critically interrogate the works in a community setting. This approach can generate social good and transform the fandom into a space for continued moral discussion.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister John Swinney has asserted that a majority win for his Scottish National Party (SNP) in the next Holyrood election should trigger a new independence referendum, citing the precedent set in 2011. After the SNP's majority win that year, the UK government agreed to the 2014 referendum. Swinney argues this precedent puts the SNP in a strong position to negotiate a new vote, despite the current UK Labour government's opposition. The strategy was backed by delegates at the SNP party conference.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has urged the Trump administration to follow his lead by impeaching "corrupt judges," a call that has found support among prominent MAGA figures. This comes amid heightened threats against the U.S. judiciary and administration attacks on judges who have ruled against its policies. Experts worry that this rhetoric, mirroring tactics used by authoritarians in other countries, is a deliberate attempt to undermine judicial independence. The U.S. Marshals Service has reported a record number of threats against federal judges in 2025.</p>

The club had reportedly made him their top choice to take over, but his rejection has left the board in a challenging position. Reports suggest Gerrard's reluctance may stem from a desire not to work under the club's new sporting director structure. With their primary target gone, Rangers must now consider other candidates for the high-pressure role, a decision seen as a significant gamble.</p>

Skaggs died in 2019 from an overdose of fentanyl and oxycodone supplied by Kay, who is now serving a 22-year prison sentence. The Angels maintain they were unaware of the drug distribution and will defend themselves in court.</p>
