          <p>The New York Knicks delivered a resounding 119-81 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 6 of their Eastern Conference semi-final series, securing their place in the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 23 points, leading the Knicks to a dominant performance in front of a star-studded home crowd. The Knicks will now face the Indiana Pacers in a highly anticipated conference final series, reminiscent of their classic showdowns in the 1990s.

          <p>Audio snippets from former President Joe Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur have surfaced, corroborating Hur's description of Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The recordings, obtained by Axios, highlight Biden's difficulty recalling dates and his halting speech, particularly when discussing the period around his son Beau's death. Staff members can be heard correcting him on the year of Beau's death and Trump's first election. The release of the audio has reignited concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, especially after a rocky debate performance led to his withdrawal from the presidential race. This article provides additional context on the investigation of Biden's handling of classified documents.</p>

          <p>A four-minute audio clip from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s 2023 special counsel interview was released, revealing his struggles to recall key dates. The audio, published by Axios, captures Biden speaking softly and haltingly as he stumbled over the years his son died and Donald J. Trump was first elected. Republicans have long sought the release of this recording, believing it would provide evidence of a decline in Biden’s mental acuity. The Biden administration had previously blocked the release of the audio, citing executive privilege and concerns that it could hinder future witness cooperation. This article references the Hur report and the controversy surrounding Biden's memory.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are causing widespread fear among those who rely on the program. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave 8.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans argue that the cuts are intended to eliminate fraud and waste, many Americans worry about reduced access to healthcare or being forced to choose between healthcare and basic necessities. The article highlights personal stories of individuals and families who depend on Medicaid for critical services, including caregiving and opioid treatment programs.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as high winds swept across dry farmlands, creating a wall of dust that significantly reduced visibility. The National Weather Service confirmed this was only the second time in its history that it issued a dust storm warning, and the first time including the Chicago metropolitan area. The dust storm caused near-zero visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of dust and scattered showers. Several schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving discarded shoes new traction by collecting used sneakers and either reusing or recycling them. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries where they are resold in mom-and-pop shops, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and repurposed into flooring, mats, tiles, and even sandals. The company processes over one million shoes per year, diverting them from landfills.

She rejected suggestions that her accusations were financially motivated during her four days of testimony in the New York criminal trial of her ex-boyfriend. Ms. Ventura described being coerced into participating in these sessions, which involved male escorts, due to threats of violence from Mr. Combs.

          <p>A teenage girl in Blackwood, N.J., escaped from her home and reported years of imprisonment and abuse by her mother and stepfather. The girl, now 18, claimed she was locked in a dog crate, chained in a bathroom, and sexually assaulted. Prosecutors have filed charges against her mother and stepfather, including assault, kidnapping, and sexual assault. Police found squalid conditions in the home, including a room rigged with an alarm system. The case has drawn comparisons to another recent incident involving long-term confinement.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former F.B.I. Director James Comey about a social media post that Trump administration officials claimed was a call for President Trump’s assassination.

Comey removed the post after it drew criticism, stating he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence. The interview highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and Trump, dating back to Comey's firing in 2017.</p>

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working on transforming traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. The research team has developed a small rocket, Tianxing-1, which features wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets. While similar to hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 operates at a slower speed, potentially limiting its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
