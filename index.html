          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has vowed to bring justice after two suspects allegedly rammed a Department of Homeland Security agent's vehicle in Chicago. The suspects, Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, are described as domestic terrorists by DHS, with Martinez having a history of doxxing federal agents and being armed with a semi-automatic weapon. Following the incident, authorities arrested both individuals, charging them with assaulting federal officers with a deadly weapon, and the cases are being treated as assaults on federal officers. The FBI source emphasized their commitment to finding and prosecuting those who attack law enforcement officials, ensuring they face justice for their actions. Optimism for the safety of federal officers is boosted by the prompt action of law enforcement. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration deployed federalized California National Guard troops to Oregon, despite a judge temporarily blocking the deployment of Oregon's National Guard to Portland. California and Oregon's attorneys general jointly requested a block on the deployment, arguing it violates state sovereignty. Oregon's governor stated she was aware of the troops' arrival and emphasized there's no insurrection in Portland. Newsom, California's governor, plans to sue the Trump administration, calling the deployment a breathtaking abuse of power and characterizing it as using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between federal and state authority amidst protests in Portland. </p>

          <p>China's factories are increasingly relying on robots to maintain production levels as the country's population declines. Last year, nearly 300,000 industrial robots were installed in Chinese factories, which is more than half of the world's total. These robots are performing tasks such as welding, assembling electronics, and moving heavy loads, helping to fill labor gaps. A professor from Tsinghua University notes that while simple, repetitive tasks will be handled by robots, complex tasks still require human ingenuity, and China's manufacturing industry can maintain its competitive edge through workforce education and robotics. The use of robots in manufacturing is anticipated to increase. </p>

          <p>The article discusses why COVID-19 vaccines are not currently covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and the complexities surrounding compensation for injuries related to these vaccines. The VICP was created in the 1980s to compensate individuals injured by certain vaccines, but COVID vaccines fall under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), which has a more restrictive Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). Legal experts argue that COVID vaccines should be added to the VICP, but this would require several steps, including the vaccine becoming a recommended childhood vaccine, Congress passing an excise tax, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services adding it to the Vaccine Injury Table. Concerns exist about the potential backlog if COVID vaccines are added to the VICP, given the existing claims in the countermeasures program. </p>

          <p>President Trump is reassigning approximately 200 members of California's National Guard from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon, to support ICE and protect federal property. This move is an attempt to circumvent a federal judge's order that temporarily blocked him from deploying Oregon's National Guard to Portland. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek stated that there is no need for military intervention in Oregon, and California Governor Gavin Newsom called the deployment appalling and un-American. Newsom vowed to fight the move in court, stating that the commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens. The reassignment comes after the governor of Illinois said around 300 National Guard members were due to be sent to Chicago. </p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index experienced a significant jump, reaching a record high after the Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. Takaichi's stance in favor of economic stimulus is expected to influence the Bank of Japan to maintain its accommodative monetary policy. Credit Agricole CIB suggests that Takaichi's administration is likely to shift policy towards expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, while Japan's 30-year bond yield rose, reflecting market reactions to the leadership change. The stock market's reaction indicates a positive outlook on the potential economic policies under the new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 30 million people in the UK who purchased an Apple or Samsung smartphone between 2015 and 2024 may be entitled to around £17. This potential payout hinges on the success of a case brought by the consumer campaign group Which? against US tech giant Qualcomm. Which? is accusing Qualcomm of anti-competitive practices, claiming the firm forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices for essential handset components. If Which? is successful, it will seek £480m from Qualcomm to be distributed among affected British phone owners. The case is focused on whether Qualcomm abused a dominant position, and similar cases against Qualcomm are ongoing in Canada and the EU. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the concept of "swag gap" relationships, where partners have noticeable differences in style and appearance, and whether this is inherently negative. A swag gap is described as a disconnect in aesthetics, clothing, and lifestyle between partners, with one being more fashion-conscious than the other. Experts suggest this can lead to conflicts if partners don't feel proud standing beside each other, but it could also simply reflect differing priorities. Some argue that trying to change a partner's style is dangerous, while others believe that having similar energy levels and being supportive of each other are more important than matching aesthetics. The key to a happy relationship lies in mutual support and respect, regardless of style differences. </p>

Some MPs believe Badenoch needs more time to repair the party's image after a significant defeat, while others feel the clock is ticking due to a lack of direction and a failure to acknowledge their existence. Badenoch has started inviting MPs for lunch to address criticism, but some remain skeptical, citing a looming confidence vote in November. The upcoming elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd, and English councils are seen as critical moments for her leadership, with some predicting this will be her last conference as leader. </p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the president's actions as a breathtaking abuse of power and vowed to sue. Officials said the troops were able to deploy quickly because they were already on active duty in response to unrest in Los Angeles.

Shadow chancellor Mel Stride is expected to unveil the "first-job bonus" at the party's conference in Manchester, diverting national insurance payments into a long-term savings account. The plans are reportedly funded by £47bn in public spending cuts over five years, affecting areas such as welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid. Proposals include restricting welfare claims for individuals with low-level mental health problems and reducing the number of civil servants by approximately 132,000.

Jaguar Land Rover experienced a major cyber attack that halted production and resulted in estimated losses of £50m per week.

A recent report found that the average cost of a data breach was $4.4m, and major businesses like Marks & Spencer and the Co-op have suffered significant financial losses.

Netanyahu, who has long presented his alliance with Trump as an electoral asset, cannot afford a public feud with the president. Trump has also previously pressured Netanyahu to abort a counterstrike in Iran and has made the Israeli leader apologize to Qatar for a recent strike.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk is experiencing a mass exodus of employees across his five companies, attributed to his demanding work ethic and controversial political stances. A report in the Financial Times highlights the high turnover rate among top-level employees, with some citing a lack of work-life balance and others expressing unease about Musk's political views. Some employees at Tesla have left due to the company's shift away from electric vehicles and towards AI-powered robotics. As the race for top talent heats up, particularly in the AI sector, Musk's reputation has become more of a challenge than a benefit. The situation is compounded by Tesla's pivot away from EVs, leaving some disillusioned. </p>

          <p>An abandoned railway station in southern Armenia is set to become a symbol of peace brokered by President Trump, known as the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (Tripp). The plan involves US companies developing a 43km route through Armenian territory, creating a corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan. This proposal is key to ending the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, with the US mediation becoming possible due to Russia's weakened position in the South Caucasus. The route is seen as part of a "middle corridor" linking the EU with Central Asia and China, bypassing Russia. </p>

Coach Jim Harbaugh emphasized the need for focus and discipline, but the Chargers have been penalized a combined 24 times in their last two losses. The Washington Commanders rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt had a strong performance, contributing significantly to the Commanders' victory.

          <p>A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting partisan language into Department of Education employees' out-of-office email messages. The American Federation of Government Employees argues that forcing civil servants to speak on behalf of a political agenda violates their First Amendment rights. The lawsuit challenges the administration's use of partisan messaging in government communications during the shutdown, with messages blaming Democrats for the situation. Employees reported that the messages were inserted without their consent and differed from the model language provided by the department. The lawsuit names the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon as defendants. </p>

          <p>Russell Martin has been dismissed as Rangers head coach after just 17 games, following a string of poor performances and growing fan discontent. The article details the chaotic end to Martin's tenure, including a draw at Falkirk that led to his exit with a police escort. Martin's explanations for the team's struggles often blamed the players, and his unpopular choices, such as dropping club captain James Tavernier, fueled fan animosity. The article suggests that the club's problems extend beyond Martin, with scrutiny now falling on sporting director Kevin Thelwell and chief executive Patrick Stewart for player acquisitions. The club is now searching for a new manager to restore stability. </p>

          <p>Jim Gavin, a former Dublin gaelic football manager and Fianna Fáil candidate, has withdrawn from the Irish presidential election with immediate effect. Gavin cited a mistake that was not in keeping with his character and the standards he set himself as the reason for his withdrawal. The decision follows a news report alleging Gavin owed money to a former tenant, which he addressed during a televised debate. Taoiseach Micheál Martin supported Gavin's decision, stating that it was the correct one, and Gavin expressed his belief in the country and its people. His withdrawal leaves Independent TD Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys as the remaining candidates. </p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to shut down factories. Manufacturing will resume first at JLR's engine factory in Wolverhampton, but it is expected to be several weeks before all operations are running at full capacity. The resumption of operations will provide relief to JLR's suppliers, some of which have faced significant financial pressure. The government has announced it would underwrite a £1.5bn loan guarantee to JLR in a bid to support its parts and service suppliers. The company is continuing to investigate the attack, which forced the company to shut its IT systems. </p>

Pelicot is returning to court to face one of her attackers, who is appealing his conviction. Despite Pelicot's public stance and the MeToo movement, substantive changes in how the French state tackles sexual violence are lacking, with experts noting a deterioration. Campaigners cite statistics showing flat-lining conviction rates despite a rise in reported cases, and a Senate report concluded that the government was "lacking a strategic compass" in tackling sexual violence. The situation is viewed as complex and challenging. </p>

          <p>Sophie Fay, an NHS nurse, had her leg amputated after being diagnosed with a rare cancerous tumor in her calf. Initially dismissing the pain as a muscle injury, she sought medical help when her calf became swollen and hot to touch. An MRI revealed a large tumor identified as spindle cell sarcoma of the bone, which is an extremely rare soft-tissue tumor. As her blood vessels and nerves were completely encased by the tumor, amputation was the only viable treatment option. Ms. Fay is sharing her story to raise awareness of bone cancer symptoms and prevent others from experiencing similar diagnostic delays. </p>

          <p>China is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-end chips to challenge the dominance of Silicon Valley-based Nvidia. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, warned that China is just "nanoseconds behind" the US in chip development. Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Huawei are developing chips that can match the performance of Nvidia's semiconductors. While China's semiconductors perform similarly to the US in predictive AI, they fall short in complex analytics, according to some experts. Despite progress, China still relies on the US for the most powerful chips and lacks highly developed supply chains. </p>

          <p>The article explores the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a government program designed to compensate individuals and families who have experienced rare vaccine injuries. The Thompsons, whose son Jacob developed a severe form of epilepsy after receiving a combination shot, received a $2.1 million judgment from vaccine court. The VICP was established in the 1980s to shield drug manufacturers from liability while ensuring compensation for those injured by vaccines. The court is no-fault, meaning negligence does not need to be proven, and the program is structured around a Vaccine Injury Table listing eligible vaccines and injuries. The court acknowledges delays in processing claims, with a backlog of more than 3,000 cases. </p>
