          <p>An essay examines President Trump's efforts to expand executive power, tracing the intellectual influences behind his approach to figures like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and scholars affiliated with the Claremont Institute. It argues that Trump's administration draws on a tradition of right-wing thought that favors strong, decisive executive action, often at the expense of established legal and constitutional norms. The author warns that this expansive view of presidential power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office, undermining the separation of powers and establishing a near-permanent state of emergency. The essay calls for a renewed emphasis on the importance of personal character and adherence to constitutional constraints in politics.</p>

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck near Israel's main international airport, causing flight suspensions and prompting Prime Minister Netanyahu to threaten retaliation. The missile, fired by the Houthi militia, resulted in minor injuries and highlighted vulnerabilities in Israel's air defense system. International airlines canceled flights following the attack, and officials condemned the aggression, with some pointing to Iran's involvement. This incident underscores the ongoing tensions and potential for escalation in the region, as well as the challenges of defending against long-range missile attacks.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies the Number One Relationship-Breaking Phrase: 'Why Can't You Be More Like...?'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 12:50:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like...?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships, leading to insecurity and feelings of inadequacy. The phrase is a symptom of a deeper issue: the fear of open communication. The person on the receiving end will start questioning their worth and constantly wonder if they're living up to expectations. Research suggests that people avoid directly expressing their needs due to uncertainty about their partner's response, leading to pent-up frustrations and the use of comparisons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of underused single-family homes on spacious lots could be refitted for multiple occupancy, offering a potential solution to the affordable housing crisis. Developer Monte Anderson is experimenting with "roommate houses," converting single-family homes into multiple studio apartments while navigating zoning regulations. This approach addresses the housing mismatch between older people living in large homes and the growing demand for smaller, more affordable units. Cities and states are increasingly encouraging such conversions through policies that allow backyard homes and lot subdivisions, adding housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption.</p>

          <p>The White House shared a meme of President Trump styled as a Star Wars character for May the 4th, but the image depicted him as a Sith Lord, a symbol of the Dark Side. The post, intended to portray Trump as a patriotic Jedi, instead featured him holding a red lightsaber, associated with the Sith. The incident drew criticism, especially following the previous day's backlash over an AI-generated photo of Trump as the Pope. The meme highlighted the administration's ongoing efforts to engage with social media trends, but also the potential for missteps and unintended messaging.</p>
