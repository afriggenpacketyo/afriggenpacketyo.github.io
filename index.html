          <p>European markets experienced a rebound, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 gaining after two consecutive sessions of decline, as traders awaited Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, a key indicator for the AI sector. France's CAC 40 index also recovered despite concerns over potential political instability and challenges in passing the 2026 budget, following opposition parties' refusal to support Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in an upcoming confidence vote. Meanwhile, U.S. futures showed slight gains, and Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed after China's industrial profits narrowed their decline in July, signaling a complex global economic landscape.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket for its tenth test flight, marking a significant comeback after earlier explosive failures. The more than 400-foot rocket achieved its first successful payload deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and stress-tested its reusable heat shield. This success is crucial for SpaceX's commercial ambitions and NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship for the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo, currently scheduled for mid-2027.</p>

Despite these challenges, Moldova was granted EU candidate status in 2022, receiving military support from European countries and hosting high-level European leaders for its 34th independence anniversary.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has acquired a 10% stake in American chipmaker Intel, making the federal government its largest shareholder. This move, which Trump defends as a beneficial deal for the U.S. economy, has drawn sharp criticism from traditional conservatives who view it as a step towards socialism or 'industrial policy.' The article highlights concerns from former economic advisors and senators about government intervention in free markets, while Intel itself warned investors in an SEC filing that the arrangement could limit future grants and increase regulation.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is exhibiting early signs of recovery, with some major developers reporting stronger earnings and reduced losses. State-owned China Resources Land saw its interim net profit rise by 16.2%, while privately owned Sunac's interim loss narrowed by 14.4%. These improvements are attributed to government stimulus measures and a recovery in retail consumption, indicating that policy lifelines are beginning to alleviate the debt crisis that plagued many developers a year prior.

          <p>Millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills increase by 2% starting in October, as announced by regulator Ofgem. This adjustment means a typical household will pay an additional £35 annually, bringing the average yearly bill to £1,755, which is slightly higher than analysts predicted. The increase is partly due to rising wholesale energy costs and government support measures for consumers, leading campaigners to warn of another challenging winter for many families.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has called for an extraordinary parliamentary session to hold a confidence vote on his proposed austerity budget, aiming to save €44 billion and reduce the budget deficit. This high-stakes decision risks Bayrou's career and could force President Macron to appoint his fifth prime minister in a short period, drawing comparisons to the political instability of the Third Republic. Opposition parties, including the far-right and left-wing blocs, have vowed to vote against the motion, making it highly unlikely Bayrou will secure a majority and potentially leading to fresh elections.</p>

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled what is believed to be the first 'portrait' of a Viking: a miniature 10th-century figurine carved from walrus tusk. Measuring just 1.2 inches, the artwork depicts a man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly-groomed hairstyle, challenging common perceptions of Vikings as wild. Curator Peter Pentz noted the figure's detailed carvings and smiling expression are unique among Viking Age art, which typically features animal motifs and simplistic human representations, suggesting it could represent a high-ranking individual like King Harald Bluetooth.</p>

          <p>North Korea's state media, KCNA, sharply criticized South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, labeling him a 'hypocrite' for his comments on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula during his U.S. trip. Lee had expressed hopes for an 'upgraded global alliance' with the U.S. if a path to denuclearization and peace emerged, but Pyongyang dismissed this as a 'naive dream.' The article underscores North Korea's firm stance on its 'inevitable' nuclear power status, reiterated after the failed 2019 summit with the United States, despite Lee's efforts to foster warmer inter-Korean ties.</p>

The protest follows a Guardian report alleging the IDF used Microsoft's Azure cloud platform for mass surveillance data, prompting Microsoft to hire an outside firm to investigate, while stating its terms of service prohibit such use.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's steep 50% tariffs on most U.S. imports from India have officially taken effect, punishing one of America's key Indo-Pacific partners for its purchases of discounted Russian oil and weapons.

In response, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged domestic self-reliance, promising tax cuts and advocating for a 'Made in India' movement to mitigate the economic impact, signaling a potential shift in India's trade and diplomatic alignments.</p>
