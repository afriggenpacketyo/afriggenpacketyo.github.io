          <h2>Supreme Court Appears Divided Over Oklahoma Religious Charter School Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 21:00:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding an Oklahoma case concerning the creation of a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, potentially impacting the separation of church and state. Justices appeared split, with some concerned about public funds flowing to religious schools and others arguing against discrimination based on religion. A ruling in favor of the school could challenge laws in numerous states requiring charter schools to be nonsectarian, while a deadlock would uphold the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision against the school. The court's decision, expected by the end of June or early July, could have significant implications for the relationship between government funding and religious education in public schools.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Apple violated a previous court order by charging commissions on purchases made outside its App Store, siding with Epic Games in an antitrust dispute.

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of preliminary rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising landlord expenses. The proposed increases range from 1.75% to 4.75% for one-year leases and 4.75% to 7.75% for two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the coming months. Tenant advocates argue the increases will exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords claim they are insufficient to cover rising costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yosemite National Park officials are warning visitors to exercise caution around mule deer, which cause more injuries to humans than any other animal in the park. Despite their seemingly harmless appearance, deer are wild and skittish, equipped with sharp hooves and antlers that they will use to defend themselves if startled. Approaching or feeding wildlife is illegal, and visitors are advised to maintain a safe distance. Mule deer also tend to gather near roads at dawn and dusk, requiring drivers to exercise caution.</p>

          <p>An 18-wheeler carrying eight million dimes overturned on U.S. Route 287 in Alvord, Texas, resulting in a metallic sea of loose change. The truck, transporting the freshly minted coins for the U.S. Mint, caused a 14-hour road closure as cleanup crews used vacuum trucks and shovels to collect the spilled dimes. The driver and passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Despite initial rumors of an $8 million spill, the actual amount was $800,000, and the town's residents did not attempt to collect the coins.</p>

Internal statistics show that AI recommendation algorithms are driving increased engagement and better returns for advertisers, but the company did increase its 2025 capital expenditures guidance to account for infrastructure hardware and trade discussion uncertainty.</p>

A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking at an annual rate of 0.3%. This contraction is attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. Concerns are rising that these tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, potentially leading to a recession. The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth due to the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs.</p>
