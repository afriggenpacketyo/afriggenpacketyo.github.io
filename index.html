Fiennes, 62, followed a rigorous regimen including weight training, running, and ballet, losing nearly 16 pounds in the process to achieve the physique of a "hero in exile." Damon, 54, known for embracing challenges, worked with a trainer to perform 100 pull-ups multiple times a week.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crepey skin, characterized by its thin and crinkled appearance, is primarily caused by sun exposure, which leads to the loss of collagen and elastin. Lifestyle factors like smoking and genetics also contribute to its formation, with women often noticing it around menopause due to decreased estrogen levels. Prevention involves sun protection through clothing and sunscreen, while over-the-counter treatments containing retinoids, hyaluronic acid, and antioxidants can help stimulate collagen production. Doctor-administered treatments like injectables and lasers can also improve skin quality, but realistic expectations are important.</p>

          <p>A study from the University of Turku found that maternal grandmothers can buffer the negative effects of adverse childhood experiences on their grandchildren. The research, based on a survey of English and Welsh youth, suggests that support from maternal grandmothers, such as childcare or financial assistance, can protect grandchildren from the long-lasting impacts of trauma. This protective effect was not observed with other grandparents, aligning with the grandmother hypothesis, which posits that grandmothers increase their daughter's fertility by helping care for children. The study highlights the importance of a strong support system for children facing hardship.</p>

          <p>Survivors and families are gathering at Bergen-Belsen to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the camp's liberation, a site that became synonymous with the horrors of Nazi concentration camps. British and Canadian troops discovered thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors upon entering the camp in April 1945. Unlike other camps destroyed by the Germans, Bergen-Belsen remained intact, offering chillingly vivid accounts of the atrocities. Overcrowding led to widespread disease and starvation, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands, primarily Jews.</p>

          <p>Despite making no splashy selections in the 2025 NFL draft, the Los Angeles Rams have arguably positioned themselves for future success by acquiring an additional first-round pick in the 2026 draft. General manager Les Snead traded for the pick, giving the Rams two first-round selections next year, potentially for a quarterback to replace Matthew Stafford. This move aligns with Snead's history of strategic draft trades and sets the Rams up for continued competitiveness in the coming seasons, including the Super Bowl LXI at SoFi Stadium.</p>

Students report instances of visa revocations with minimal explanation, leading to concerns about potential harassment.
