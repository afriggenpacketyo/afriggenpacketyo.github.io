          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first Open Championship with a commanding performance at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. Starting the final day with a four-shot lead, he quickly extended his advantage and finished the tournament at 17 under par, four strokes clear of his closest competitor. This victory marks Scheffler's second major title of the year and his fourth major overall, placing him alongside Tiger Woods in certain statistical milestones. He now only needs the US Open to complete a career Grand Slam.</p>

          <h2>Acting ICE Director Links Rise in Officer Assaults to Political Rhetoric</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 13:42:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, has attributed a significant increase in assaults on his officers to inflammatory rhetoric from some elected officials. In a recent interview, Lyons stated that criticism and what he described as shaming of the agency's law enforcement mission are contributing to a more dangerous environment for his agents. He noted an 830% increase in assaults compared to the previous year, linking the spike directly to the heightened political discourse surrounding the agency's expanded operations under the current administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting head of ICE, Todd Lyons, has confirmed he will continue to permit agents to wear masks during arrest operations, despite widespread criticism and safety concerns. While acknowledging he is not a proponent of the practice, Lyons asserted that it is a necessary tool to protect officers and their families from doxxing and threats. This policy has drawn condemnation from legal advocates and a coalition of state attorneys general, who argue it undermines accountability, fosters a climate of fear, and could lead to criminals impersonating federal agents.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expressed strong confidence that the Trump administration is on the verge of securing major trade agreements, calling the next two weeks potentially historic for American interests. With an August 1 deadline looming for increased tariffs on numerous countries, Lutnick stated that the administration's assertive strategy has successfully brought key trading partners to the negotiating table. He argued that these countries will either open their markets to US goods or face significant tariffs, a policy he believes will ultimately benefit American businesses and consumers.

          <p>A cast member of the opera Il trovatore staged a protest during the final curtain call at London's Royal Opera House by unfurling a large Palestinian flag. The spontaneous demonstration on the closing night of the production led to a brief scuffle as a stage official unsuccessfully attempted to take the flag from the performer. The Royal Opera House issued a statement calling the protest inappropriate and unauthorized, emphasizing its commitment to political impartiality. The incident drew a mixed reaction from the audience, with some booing and others cheering.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and his office have adopted a notably more aggressive and confrontational social media strategy, directly targeting former President Trump and his allies. This shift in tone, which includes using insults and memes popular on the political right, marks a departure from the traditional Democratic approach of taking the "high road." Newsom's advisors state the change was prompted by the federal deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles for immigration sweeps, and is designed to counter what they call the opposition's cruelty and misinformation by matching their tactics.</p>

          <p>A sustained wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia prompted the temporary closure of Moscow's major airports, leading to the cancellation or redirection of over 270 flights. Russia's defense ministry reported downing more than 230 drones since Saturday, with 27 intercepted over the capital region alone. The disruptions mark a significant impact on civilian infrastructure deep inside Russia, with the aviation watchdog confirming that all four of the capital's airports were affected. Meanwhile, Russian strikes on Ukraine reportedly killed at least three people overnight.</p>

          <p>A meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Donald Trump is being considered for this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. According to multiple sources, this event presents the most likely opportunity for the two leaders to meet in person, either on the sidelines of the summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. Relations have been tense since Trump returned to office, but recent high-level talks between the two nations' top diplomats suggest a mutual desire to stabilize the relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete. The author contends that in an economy shaken by AI, immigration, and the rise of the "gig economy," focusing on jobs alone is misleading. Instead, it is proposed that a more relevant metric would be tracking income levels, using real-time data from tax returns and private platforms to determine the percentage of the population earning above a certain threshold. This shift would provide a more accurate picture of economic well-being.</p>

          <p>Four people, including two children and two adults, remain in the hospital following a tragic school coach crash in Somerset, UK, that killed a 10-year-old boy. A major incident was declared after the coach, which was returning from a school trip, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. The vehicle was carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School, which was closed on Friday as the community mourned and left tributes. An investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, and local fundraisers have collected over £40,000 for those affected.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are voicing increasing frustration and mistrust toward their own government's handling of negotiations for their release. Campaigners and relatives feel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is not prioritizing a deal to bring all hostages home, pointing to the insistence on certain military conditions and alleged leaks intended to sway public opinion. With some hostages having been killed in captivity while awaiting a deal, families are placing more hope in international pressure, particularly from the United States, to secure the return of their loved ones.</p>

In response, the Football Association is working with police to identify those responsible, and Carter announced she will be taking a step back from social media. The Lionesses team also stated they will no longer take a knee before matches, as it is clear a different approach is needed to combat racism. The abuse has been widely condemned, with support for Carter coming from her club, anti-discrimination charities, and the UK Prime Minister.</p>
