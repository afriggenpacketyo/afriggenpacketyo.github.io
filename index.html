        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's ruling. The decision prohibits federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, which were deemed insufficient for reasonable suspicion. This legal battle stems from controversial raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests within the region's Latino community. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the ruling as a protection of constitutional rights against indiscriminate enforcement.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee is investigating allegations that former President Joe Biden's aides concealed his mental decline and improperly used an autopen for executive decisions. Eight former aides, including senior staff and his physician, have been questioned, with some providing limited information or invoking the Fifth Amendment. The probe examines whether there was a deliberate effort to obscure Biden's fitness for office, particularly around key events like the 2024 presidential debate. Allies of the former president have dismissed the investigation as a partisan exercise.</p>

          <p>After a foot surgery led to excruciating, persistent pain, Amber Meade was eventually diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. For months, she experienced severe swelling and sensitivity, likening the sensation to walking on Legos while being stabbed. CRPS can develop after an injury or surgery, causing extreme pain disproportionate to the initial event, but is difficult to diagnose. Through a specialized physical therapy program and other treatments like ketamine infusions, Meade has been able to manage her symptoms and regain some quality of life.</p>

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town revitalized by a growing immigrant community, is now a center of fear due to a stringent immigration crackdown led by the local sheriff. The Butler County jail primarily houses detainees on immigration charges, generating significant revenue for the county through a partnership with ICE. This tension is exemplified by the detention of a local imam, which sparked protests and highlighted the deep national divide on immigration. The community's "American dream" narrative is now overshadowed by anxiety as local law enforcement gains ICE-like powers, threatening the very residents who helped bring the town back to life.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned for child sex trafficking, Ghislaine Maxwell is exploring several legal and political strategies to secure her release, including cooperating with federal prosecutors. Her legal team is simultaneously appealing to the Supreme Court, seeking congressional immunity, and hinting at a potential presidential clemency from the Trump administration. This multi-pronged approach comes as President Trump faces renewed scrutiny over his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Experts suggest Maxwell's cooperation is less about revealing truth and more a calculated effort to leverage the politically charged situation for her own freedom.</p>

          <p>Construction of the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest and dedicated solely to international travelers, is part of a wider $19 billion airport overhaul. Designed to be filled with natural light, it will feature streamlined customs and security on a single level, over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining, and its own resilient microgrid. The project aims to modernize aging infrastructure and accommodate growing air traffic, with its opening timed for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan Little League team was unable to compete in the Senior League World Series in South Carolina after being denied travel visas to the United States. The team from Maracaibo had won the Latin American qualifier but was blocked from entry, despite exemptions for athletes in major sporting events under a Trump administration travel ban. The State Department cited the need for additional processing time, which is difficult for teams that only qualify shortly before a tournament.

Trump claimed without evidence that the figures were "rigged," a move that critics condemned as politicizing economic data and undermining public trust. The report showed only 73,000 jobs were added in July, far below forecasts, and revised previous months downward, stoking fears of an economic slowdown exacerbated by his tariff policies.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should strategically use Donald Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein to portray him as a protector of corrupt elites, a narrative that could resonate with voters. The author suggests that instead of getting lost in conspiracy, the message should be simple: Trump's efforts to shield those involved in the Epstein scandal are part of a broader pattern of prioritizing the powerful over ordinary Americans. By consistently linking the Epstein affair to policies like tax cuts for the wealthy, Democrats could effectively challenge Trump's populist image. The piece highlights how this scandal, unlike others, has visibly unsettled the former president.</p>

After the federal prison closed in 1963, Indigenous activists occupied the island for 19 months starting in 1969, a pivotal event that spurred major changes in federal policy toward Native sovereignty. Critics argue that repurposing the site for anti-immigrant detention is not only logistically absurd but also deeply insulting and retraumatizing.

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders recently underwent a neobladder reconstruction after being treated for bladder cancer. The procedure involves removing the diseased bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. Surgeons reshape the intestinal tissue into a sphere and connect it to the kidneys and urethra, creating a new, functional organ. Because it uses the patient's own tissue, there is no risk of rejection, though patients must retrain themselves to control urination, as the neobladder lacks nerve connections to the brain.

Russian commentators and officials have so far avoided escalating the situation, suggesting they do not view Trump's action as a serious military threat but rather as part of his unpredictable political style.

The engagement, one of the largest air battles in decades, also highlighted Pakistan's effective use of a "kill chain" network that integrated Chinese and other foreign military hardware.

          <p>A growing number of major Jewish American organizations, including some that traditionally defend Israel, are publicly expressing concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Groups like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement have issued statements urging Israel to ensure aid reaches Palestinian civilians, citing the risk of famine. This reflects a significant shift, as discomfort with Israel's blockade broadens beyond left-leaning Jewish groups. The statements highlight a moral crisis for many in the community and mirror declining support for Israel's military actions among the wider American public, particularly younger generations.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to unionize, joining a growing movement of café organizing across the United States. Workers at three Oakland locations and one in Berkeley voted 22-to-5 in favor of joining the Blue Bottle Independent Union. The union is seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks lost after Nestlé acquired the company. This victory follows a successful organizing drive by the same independent union at six Boston-area stores last year.</p>

          <p>Businesses in Southern California's "Little India" are bracing for the impact of a new 25% tariff on goods imported from India, authorized by the Trump administration. Owners of grocery stores, clothing shops, and jewelers in areas like Artesia say they will have to pass the increased costs on to consumers, fearing a drop in sales. The tariff adds to existing economic pressures and anxiety within the community, with some business owners already reporting a slowdown in foot traffic. The move is part of the administration's broader trade policy, but it leaves small business owners scrambling to cope with the financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American-made animated film "K-pop Demon Hunters" has become a massive hit in South Korea, celebrated for its authentic and detailed portrayal of Korean culture and folklore. The movie, which follows a fictional K-pop girl group that fights evil, has resonated with local audiences for its accurate depiction of everything from dining etiquette to national habits. Its success highlights the increasingly fluid boundaries of the "K-wave," demonstrating how non-Korean creators can produce content that is embraced by South Koreans. The film's popularity is a sign of K-pop's global reach and its ability to be reinterpreted by international artists.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former president, Álvaro Uribe, has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, a landmark conviction for the country. The court found him guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to the creation of right-wing militia groups during Colombia's civil war. This is the first time a former Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial, a verdict hailed by human rights groups as a major step against impunity. Uribe, who denies the charges and plans to appeal, is barred from public office and must serve his sentence at his rural estate.</p>

The new parliament will have 210 members and serve for a three-year transitional period, tasked with drafting a new constitution. However, the new electoral system remains controversial, as the interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, will appoint 70 members, while the rest will be chosen by regional committees.

The software uses AI to rapidly analyze vast amounts of data, creating comprehensive profiles of individuals for police investigations. Civil rights groups have filed constitutional complaints, arguing that this large-scale data analysis violates fundamental rights by potentially ensnaring innocent people without their knowledge. Critics also warn of Germany's growing dependence on the controversial US tech firm, owned by billionaire Peter Thiel, and the opaque nature of its software.</p>

          <p>A review of recent economic data reveals a complex and often contradictory picture of the U.S. economy during the Trump administration, challenging claims of a consistent boom. While second-quarter GDP showed robust growth, it followed a contraction in the first quarter, and key indicators like private investment have fallen. The administration's unpredictable trade and tariff policies have created wild swings in imports and exports. A significant slowdown in job creation, with recent figures falling far below expectations, has further complicated the economic narrative and led to the president politicizing the data.

          <p>A distinct pattern has emerged in President Trump's second term, with world leaders increasingly using praise and flattery as a primary diplomatic strategy. Leaders from the U.K., Israel, and the European Commission have offered grand gestures and effusive compliments, a stark contrast to the more skeptical approach seen during his first term. Analysts suggest this shift reflects a recognition of Trump's personal and decisive leadership style, where direct appeals and praise are seen as the most effective way to achieve favorable outcomes, such as new trade deals or security commitments. The White House points to these interactions as proof of the president's successful foreign policy.</p>

The extreme heat, which is expected to continue through August in some regions, was exacerbated by an early end to the rainy season.
