          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests expanding Father's Day into a month-long celebration, following Mother's Day. Gaffigan envisions a system where fathers receive presents on even days and enjoy a communication-free 'Ramadad' on odd days. While acknowledging the impracticality of celebrating fathers for 35 consecutive days, he emphasizes the importance of honoring dads. The article is a lighthearted take on the traditional Father's Day holiday, with Gaffigan using his signature wit to explore the concept of a 'Father's Day Month'.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport due to radar outages and air traffic controller shortages. Duffy intends to meet with airlines to determine the extent of the reductions, which will be more significant during busier afternoon hours.

          <p>Wildfires have erupted across Britain due to the driest start to spring in nearly 70 years, with fires burning in Scotland, Wales, and England. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deployed firefighters and a helicopter to combat a large forest fire near Fauldhouse, while residents were advised to keep windows and doors closed. England has experienced its driest spring since 1956, with significantly below-average rainfall in March and April. The European Unionâ€™s Copernicus climate service has issued drought warnings for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and England's Environment Agency warns of a medium risk of drought this summer if consistent rainfall does not occur.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing concerns about due process and First Amendment rights. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her detention was based on an op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper about Israel's war with Hamas. Supporters, including Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, celebrated her release, emphasizing the importance of protecting free speech and due process.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is expected to remain for the foreseeable future, aligning with President Trump's previous statements. Lutnick dismissed concerns that consumers would bear the increased costs, asserting that businesses and foreign countries will pay the tariffs. However, recent data indicates that businesses are attempting to pass costs onto consumers, and consumer confidence has declined since the tariff announcement. The commerce secretary believes that domestically produced products, which are not subject to tariffs, will allow foreign companies to compete.</p>

          <p>A recent four-day conflict between India and Pakistan, fueled by new military technology and religious nationalism, raises concerns about future clashes. The conflict involved airstrikes, anti-aircraft fire, and weaponized drones, escalating tensions and prompting international diplomacy. The article highlights the determination of both sides to gain the upper hand and the political realities that could lead to further confrontations. Despite a cease-fire, diplomatic relations remain strained, and India's threat to block water flows adds to the instability.

The government aims to reduce net migration by up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers over the next year. Rules will change this year, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government also plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws, increasing the threshold for skilled visas and narrowing exceptions for temporary shortage visas. Critics argue the plans are insufficient and call for an annual migration cap.</p>
