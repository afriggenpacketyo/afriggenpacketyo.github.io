          <p>A new comprehensive tax and spending bill will introduce significant changes for millions of Americans, though many effects are staggered over several years. The legislation imposes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and alters food assistance programs, with some changes taking effect this year and others delayed until 2026. These cuts are projected to reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion over a decade. The bill also modifies individual and business taxes, including raising the SALT deduction cap and eliminating credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood on the Guadalupe River in Texas has resulted in a major disaster at Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp. The rapidly rising waters, which surged with little warning, have led to at least 59 confirmed deaths in the area, including young campers and the camp's director. Survivors described horrific scenes as they were evacuated, and an extensive search and rescue operation is now underway for eleven missing campers and one counselor. The tragedy has raised questions about the safety of locating camps so close to the river.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, at 76, has performed his final concert, reuniting with his Black Sabbath bandmates for a farewell show in Birmingham, England. The event featured an all-star lineup of musicians, including members of Metallica and Guns N’ Roses, paying tribute to the iconic heavy metal vocalist. Despite his ongoing health issues, including Parkinson's disease, Osbourne performed several of his hits while seated on a throne. The show marks the end of his touring career, which he had previously cancelled due to his physical condition, concluding a celebrated and influential chapter in rock music history.</p>

          <p>As the death toll from devastating flash floods in central Texas rises to at least 70, the search for survivors is becoming a grim recovery operation. The disaster has prompted a federal emergency declaration, but questions are emerging about the effectiveness of the response and forecasting. Critics point to budget cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and potential staffing shortages at the local National Weather Service office. Some residents reported receiving no emergency alerts before the floodwaters hit, raising concerns about the adequacy and funding of local warning systems.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck during an attack outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility on July 4th. The incident began when police responded to a call about a suspicious person, leading to an ambush by an unknown number of suspects who opened fire. The injured officer was treated at a hospital and has since been released. Following the attack, several armed suspects, some reportedly wearing body armor, were arrested after attempting to flee.

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed at a critical moment. The system did not make a call on a point-ending shot from Kartal that appeared to be out, forcing the chair umpire to halt play and order the point to be replayed. Pavlyuchenkova, who eventually won the match, expressed frustration, stating a game was "stolen" from her and questioning why the umpire did not make the call himself.

In anonymous messages to the BBC, the officer described a collapse of the group's command structure due to months of Israeli strikes that have killed most of its leadership. This internal disintegration has resulted in a complete breakdown of security, with looting and gang activity becoming rampant. The officer warned that this lawlessness creates a dire situation where Hamas is surrounded by internal rivals as well as Israeli forces.</p>

          <p>China and Brazil have agreed to establish a joint research center focused on applying artificial intelligence to agriculture, particularly in semi-arid regions. The announcement was made by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Chinese Premier Li Qiang during the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro. One of the center's first initiatives will be an AI laboratory aimed at supporting small-scale family farming through a partnership between Brazilian and Chinese agricultural institutes. The collaboration seeks to use AI to improve environmental monitoring and soil quality, strengthening the already close bilateral relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Two years after a car crashed into an end-of-term tea party at a London school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls killed are still seeking answers. Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau died in the 2023 incident at The Study Preparatory School in Wimbledon. The driver was initially not charged after claiming an epileptic seizure, but she was re-arrested in January 2025 on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after police reviewed the case. At a memorial event, the grieving parents expressed their frustration with the long wait for a thorough investigation and accountability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported eight men with criminal convictions to South Sudan, a nation on the brink of civil war, following a contentious legal battle. This action is notable as only one of the men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries that refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that would have granted the men due process hearings. The move is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand deportations to third countries, a policy that has drawn criticism from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>The operator of the Greek oil tanker Vilamoura has stated that an external explosive device was the likely cause of a blast that damaged the vessel off the coast of Libya last week. The tanker, carrying approximately one million barrels of oil, experienced an explosion in its engine room after departing the port of Zuetina. This incident is the fifth of its kind to affect commercial shipping in the region in recent months, with maritime security sources suggesting a limpet mine may have been used. The damaged vessel has since been safely towed to Greece with its crew unharmed.</p>

Once an unknown prospect without any recruiting rankings, Williams received a scholarship offer directly from the Trojans' coaching staff, which he quickly accepted. With a 3.8 GPA, he aims to challenge the perception that talent has diminished in the L.A. City Section, which was once a recruiting stronghold for major college programs. Williams hopes his journey serves as an example that hard work can create opportunities for underprivileged student-athletes.</p>

This call for reform comes as drones have played an increasingly decisive role in recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and clashes in the Middle East. The proposed changes would focus on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into the military's existing structure.</p>
