          <p>Two cryptocurrency investors, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault, and unlawful imprisonment after allegedly torturing an Italian man in New York City to obtain his bitcoin fortune. The victim was reportedly held captive for over two weeks, during which he was shocked with electric wires, hit with a gun, and threatened. Investigators found disturbing items at the SoHo townhouse where the man was held, including a saw, crack cocaine, and body armor. The detectives who provided unauthorized security for the suspects have been placed on desk duty pending an internal affairs investigation.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth cooled in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. The report also showed that Americans cooled off on spending, with overall consumer spending rising only 0.2% in April, down from 0.7% in March, which could reflect early caution in response to higher goods prices. Incomes rose 0.8% in April, largely due to an increase in Social Security benefits resulting from the Social Security Fairness Act. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady while evaluating the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Wall Street has coined the term "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out) to describe President Trump's tariff strategy, where markets initially react negatively to tariff announcements but then rally as investors anticipate Trump backing down. A reporter's question about the expression angered Trump, suggesting the traders are right about his negotiating tactics. Despite advocating for tariffs since the 1980s, Trump's administration has frequently announced, suspended, reduced, or threatened new tariffs, leading to market volatility. The president's commitment to tariffs is undermined by a lack of careful preparation and a susceptibility to external pressure.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether Ramon Morales Reyes, who was arrested for allegedly threatening to shoot and kill President Donald Trump, may be the victim of a setup. Law enforcement sources say a handwriting test did not match the handwriting in the threatening letter. Reyes was involved in a dispute with another man currently in jail for allegedly assaulting him, who may have wanted to get Reyes deported to avoid testifying. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem initially praised the arrest but has not commented on the possibility of a setup.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered an unprotected online database exposing over 184 million records, including email addresses, passwords, and login links stored in plain text. The leaked data is tied to major platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and government and financial services. The breach could fuel fraud and identity theft, prompting recommendations to change passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and freeze credit files. Experts recommend updating passwords regularly and using unique passwords for primary email and financial accounts.</p>

She stated that the bill aims to create savings in Medicaid by targeting "waste, fraud, and abuse" in the system.
