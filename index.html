          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension due to controversial remarks about Charlie Kirk's death. Kimmel expressed that it was never his intention to make light of Kirk's murder or blame any specific group for the actions of the shooter. He acknowledged that his comments may have been ill-timed or unclear to some, understanding why people were upset. Kimmel emphasized the importance of free speech and the ability to have a show like his in a country that allows it, contrasting it with countries where comedians face imprisonment for criticizing those in power. The comedian's return included a video appearance by Robert De Niro portraying an aggressive FCC chair. Optimism here is based on the fact that the First Amendment is being actively discussed and freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa caused significant devastation across Taiwan and Hong Kong, resulting in fatalities and widespread damage. In Taiwan, a lake burst due to the typhoon, leading to at least 14 deaths and leaving many missing, while in Hong Kong, strong winds and heavy rain toppled trees and flooded coastal areas. The storm prompted the suspension of flights, schools, and train services in Hong Kong, with authorities warning of a significant storm surge. Ragasa is expected to make landfall in southern China, where over a million people have been relocated as a precaution, and businesses and schools have been ordered to shut down in several cities. The optimism score here is low due to the storm's significant impact and loss of life.</p>

In a previous interview, Ong noted the outflow of talent from Taiwan, expressing his hope that talent would remain on the island. He will be joining the school of science and engineering in Shenzhen, according to an official announcement from CUHK, and this move highlights the ongoing shifts in academic talent across the region.

          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, Colombian President Gustavo Petro demanded a "criminal process" against Donald Trump concerning US missile strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean. Petro's call comes after Trump vowed to "blow [drug smugglers] out of existence," and follows strikes that resulted in over a dozen deaths. Petro suspects some of the victims were Colombian citizens, asserting that if confirmed, a criminal investigation should be initiated against Trump and other US officials involved in ordering the strikes. The situation raises concerns about extrajudicial executions and the potential violation of international law.

          <p>The FDA is expanding its recall of frozen shrimp products due to possible contamination by Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. AquaStar is recalling three types of shrimp products sold in grocery stores across 31 states. The investigation began in August after U.S. Customs and Border Protection detected Cesium-137 in imported frozen shrimp from Indonesia. The growing number of recalls indicates that the FDA food safety inspection program is doing its job. The optimism is tempered by the potential health risks and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>China's successive five-year plans have been a pillar of macroeconomic policymaking, transforming the country into the "world's factory." Under these plans, Beijing has shifted from limited industrial capacity to mass production. The next five-year plan, the 15th, is expected to be crucial for China's move up the value chain and its ambition to become a global hub for innovation. These plans provide a survey of China’s complex economic history, marking significant milestones and policy shifts. The optimism is high due to the emphasis on economic growth and innovation.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its television stations after the show returns to ABC. This decision mirrors a similar move by Sinclair, meaning the show won't air on dozens of ABC stations in cities across the U.S. Nexstar said it will "monitor the show as it returns to ABC" and stands by its decision pending assurance of respectful dialogue. The corporation noted that the show will be available on Disney-owned streaming products. The optimism is low, reflecting the continued tensions and potential for censorship.</p>

The Skipton Group reports that rising utility bills, council tax, and rent are the main problems. The government says increasing the minimum wage is helping and building more homes.
