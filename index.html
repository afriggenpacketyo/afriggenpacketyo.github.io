          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders has publicly revealed he was diagnosed with an aggressive, high-risk form of bladder cancer. During a press conference with his medical team, it was disclosed that he underwent surgery to remove his bladder, which was then reconstructed using his own intestines. Sanders, who appeared emotional but in good spirits, confirmed he is now considered cancer-free and plans to continue coaching the team this season. His doctors stated his prognosis is very good, and he will be monitored with routine surveillance scans.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Nancy Mace is indicating she is close to announcing a run for governor of South Carolina in 2026. She cited issues like high state income tax, illegal immigration, and "gender bending ideology" as key motivations for her potential campaign. If she enters, she will join a crowded Republican primary field to succeed the term-limited Governor Henry McMaster. Mace has already singled out state Attorney General Alan Wilson as a primary rival, referencing past allegations of his inaction on sexual assault cases, which he vehemently denies.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane in the central Pacific Ocean this year, reaching Category 1 strength. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center stated that the storm is not an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands and is projected to remain well to the south. Iona is expected to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. While the central Pacific has been quiet, the eastern Pacific has already seen several named storms this season, including two major hurricanes.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed "deep concern" following reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss all members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This independent panel provides critical, evidence-based recommendations for preventive health services like cancer screenings, which guide insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The AMA urged the administration to retain the task force to ensure its non-partisan work continues without interruption. An HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made on the matter.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction. The central argument is that a non-prosecution agreement made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida should have protected Maxwell from criminal charges, as it extended to his co-conspirators. Her lawyers contend that the government must honor this agreement to maintain trust in the justice system, regardless of the geographic location of the prosecution. Federal prosecutors have countered that the agreement was limited to Florida and that Maxwell, not being a party to it, cannot enforce its terms.</p>

          <p>California is leading a coalition of states in a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture to block a demand for the personal data of millions of SNAP recipients. The USDA, citing a Trump executive order to combat fraud, has ordered states to transmit sensitive information including names, Social Security numbers, and addresses. State officials argue the unprecedented demand violates privacy laws and could create a culture of fear, discouraging eligible families from seeking essential food assistance. The lawsuit seeks to prevent the USDA from withholding program funds from states that do not comply with the data request.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has declared that securing a second independence referendum depends entirely on his Scottish National Party (SNP) winning a majority in the 2026 Holyrood election. He stated that achieving independence will be the central focus of the SNP's campaign, arguing it would allow Scotland to control its energy resources and reform the welfare system. This sets a high bar for the party, as current polls suggest it may fall short of the 65 seats needed for an outright majority. Critics from opposition parties accused Swinney of prioritizing division over addressing pressing national issues like the NHS and education.</p>

NHS England data shows 58 "derogation" requests were made to the British Medical Association (BMA) to allow doctors to cross picket lines. The BMA, which is striking over pay, claims some requests were inappropriate as trusts had not adequately planned for the strike. The union stated that the situation exposed how some hospitals prioritized elective procedures over ensuring sufficient staff for emergency care, creating risks for patients.</p>

          <p>Despite two recent downgrades from financial firms Mizuho and Guggenheim, investment analysts remain broadly positive on the long-term outlook for GE Vernova. The downgrades to a neutral rating were primarily based on the stock's current valuation following a significant rally, with shares more than doubling since April. Mizuho simultaneously raised its price target for the company, citing accelerating margin expansion and strong orders. The sentiment suggests that while the stock's rapid appreciation has made it fully valued in the short term, its fundamental business prospects, particularly in gas turbine production, remain attractive for long-term investors.

This represents a potential increase from the 10% baseline tariff he previously announced and could significantly impact smaller nations.

Despite widespread poverty, corruption, and a lack of prospects for the country's youth, Biya's grip on power remains firm. Analysts attribute his longevity to a political system he has expertly crafted, where he plays potential rivals against each other and maintains a divided military structure that prevents any single faction from launching a coup. The opposition remains fragmented and unable to form a united front, while Biya's ruling party is deeply entrenched, making his re-election in the upcoming vote highly likely.</p>
