          <h2>Trump's Tariff Stance Faces Economic Pushback</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-30 16:25:14 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that tariffs will lower prices is challenged by economists who predict price increases and potential job losses.  While Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro maintains tariffs are beneficial,  economists like Diane Swonk argue the opposite, highlighting the potential negative impact on consumers and the auto industry. This showcases a clear partisan divide on economic policy, with a potential bias towards pro-Trump narratives in Navarro's statements.</p>
