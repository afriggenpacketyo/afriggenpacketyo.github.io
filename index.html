          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a Â£2bn upgrade. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. The Welsh government is funding the project through a Mutual Investment Model, paying over Â£40m annually for 30 years. The completion of the road is expected to improve connectivity and generate economic opportunities for the region.</p>

          <p>Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland called for a more forceful Democratic party at Jim Clyburn's annual Fish Fry in South Carolina. Both governors emphasized the need to build coalitions and actively engage with various constituencies, stressing the urgency of the current political moment. They urged Democrats to compete in every district and focus on delivering tangible alternatives to Trump's policies. While both governors denied any aspirations for the 2028 presidential nomination, their appearance at the event, known for attracting rising Democratic stars, fueled speculation about their future roles in the party. Their focus is on the 2025 elections and delivering an alternative to the current political climate.</p>

          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, carried a rare cancer-causing mutation linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 children. The mutation in the TP53 gene causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, significantly increasing cancer risk. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the variant's presence but stated it was undetectable through standard screening at the time of donation. The bank advocates for an internationally binding family limit and has proactively implemented its own limit of 75 families per donor. The situation has sparked discussions about genetic screening and donor limits in assisted reproduction.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that the UN's population figures may significantly underestimate the number of people living in rural areas, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions. This is due to incomplete or unreliable census data in the global south. While concerns about overpopulation are common, the article argues that these anxieties often reflect power struggles over resource distribution and whose lives are valued. The author suggests that with responsible consumption and sustainable technologies, the world can avoid catastrophic outcomes despite a growing population. Ethnonationalist concerns about birthrate disparities are also addressed, emphasizing the need for immigrants in aging societies.</p>

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of privacy and integrity risk assessments for new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, replacing human reviewers with AI. This change aims to accelerate product development but raises concerns about potential oversights regarding user privacy and real-world harm. Internal documents show that sensitive areas like AI safety and youth risk may also be subject to automated reviews. While Meta claims human expertise will still be used for complex issues, former employees worry that engineers, who are not privacy experts, will now make critical judgments about risks. The company is auditing the decisions the automated systems make for projects that are not assessed by humans.</p>

          <p>Veteran lawyers are questioning the legal validity of President Trump's deals with law firms, where firms agree to provide pro bono services in exchange for maintaining access to federal buildings and curtailing investigations into their hiring practices. Critics argue that these deals, reached under coercion, lack a genuine meeting of the minds and may violate federal bribery statutes. Some targeted law firms are challenging Trump's actions in court, with one judge ruling an executive order against a firm as "a staggering punishment." The deals raise ethical concerns about conflicts of interest and the independence of the legal profession.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey expects UK defence spending to reach 3% of GDP by 2034, underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defence review. The review, based on this assumption, will outline priorities for military and security spending, warning of a "new era of threat" involving drones and artificial intelligence. The plan includes deploying new "digital" experts alongside troops to counter these threats. While the independent budget watchdog estimates this would cost an additional Â£17.3 billion in 2029-30, Healey asserts that the UK will meet its target, enabling long-term planning and addressing pressures. This commitment comes amid ongoing negotiations for departmental spending allocations.</p>

          <p>New satellite images reveal North Korea's deployment of balloon-like objects around its damaged 5,000-ton warship, which has been partially submerged since a failed launch. Experts suggest these balloons could be used to stabilize the ship or shield it from drone surveillance. The destroyer suffered damage during a launch malfunction on May 21, causing the stern to slide into the water. Kim Jong Un has ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workersâ€™ Party, treating it as a matter of national honor. Analysts note that the use of balloons might prevent further flooding or reduce stress on the stranded part of the ship.</p>

Germany's intention to deport migrants back to Greece is based on a court ruling that migrants do not face extreme hardships there. Greece is reluctant to accept these returns, especially if Germany sends back a significant number of migrants who have traveled from Greece to Germany.</p>
