          <p>A dramatic fracture has occurred between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the president's major tax bill, with Trump expressing disappointment in Musk's opposition to the budget package due to the elimination of electric vehicle credits and the rejection of Musk's NASA pick. Musk quickly retorted on social media, criticizing the "disgusting pork" in the bill and claiming that Trump would have lost the election without his support. He highlighted his significant financial backing of Trump's 2024 campaign, which amounted to over $250 million, adding to the intensity of the public disagreement. The dispute underscores the challenges Thune faces in garnering support for the bill, given Musk's public criticism and its potential influence on lawmakers. </p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group's shares experienced a significant surge of up to 235% during its New York Stock Exchange debut, following an initial public offering that raised almost $1.1 billion.

Circle joins a limited number of pure-play crypto companies listed in the U.S., marking the company's second attempt at going public after a previous merger collapsed due to regulatory hurdles. CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the importance of working with governments and policymakers to ensure the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, highlighting Circle's commitment to compliance and transparency in the crypto industry. Wall Street analysts anticipate substantial growth in the stablecoin sector, potentially creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity in the next five years. </p>

          <p>Tesla's shares experienced an 8% drop as CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump engaged in a public spat over the spending bill currently under consideration in Congress. Trump voiced his surprise at Musk's opposition to the bill, attributing it to the exclusion of EV credits, prompting a sharp response from Musk, who asserted his critical role in Trump's election victory. Musk has recently criticized the bill as a "disgusting abomination," marking a notable shift in his stance toward the administration's policies. The stock's decline follows a previous rally in May, and this recent downturn reflects investor concerns amid the ongoing conflict between Musk and the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>Senate Republican Leader John Thune is determined to advance President Donald Trump's legislative agenda despite growing GOP holdouts and criticism from Elon Musk. Thune emphasized that "failure is not an option" and that efforts are underway to align GOP members on the megabill, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending for military and border security. However, the bill faces opposition due to concerns about its potential impact on the deficit and disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap.

          <p>Initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits have risen to their highest level in eight months, indicating a possible slowdown in the labor market due to concerns over tariffs affecting U.S. businesses and consumers. New applications for jobless benefits reached 247,000, exceeding economists' predictions and suggesting potential shifts in the workforce ahead of the May jobs report. Firings overseen by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency are a leading cause of job cuts in 2025, with over 280,000 federal workers abruptly terminated. Several major companies, including Walmart and Procter & Gamble, have also announced layoffs, contributing to the overall sense of economic uncertainty. </p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record decrease in April, driven by a sharp decline in import demand ahead of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The deficit fell to $61.6 billion, a significant drop from the previous month, as companies and consumers adjusted their purchasing patterns. While a reduced trade deficit might seem positive, economists caution against interpreting it as entirely beneficial, noting that international trade has generally benefited the U.S. economy. Trump indicated that further trade talks with China are likely to occur soon, following a recent conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second-term agenda relies heavily on cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, potentially impacting millions of Americans. The bill passed by the House proposes significant reductions to Medicaid, potentially causing approximately 10.9 million people to lose coverage over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. SNAP cuts are estimated to total $230 billion over 10 years, affecting low-income individuals and families who rely on the program for groceries. Republicans assert that these cuts aim to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" to fund tax cuts and increased border and defense spending. </p>
