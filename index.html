          <p>Israel's military announced that the Red Cross successfully retrieved the coffin of a deceased hostage from the southern Gaza Strip, with the remains now being transferred to IDF troops for official identification. This development comes after Hamas previously stated its intention to hand over the body and had earlier returned the remains of nine deceased hostages, alongside freeing 20 living captives. Despite a ceasefire agreement requiring the return of all deceased, Israel remains frustrated by Hamas's failure to hand over additional bodies, though Hamas blames Israeli restrictions on heavy machinery for impeding search efforts. The ongoing situation highlights the complex and sensitive nature of hostage recovery amidst persistent conflict and negotiation challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal challenge to the Supreme Court, seeking to overturn a lower court order that blocked the federalization and deployment of National Guard members in Illinois. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argues that restricting the President's Commander-in-Chief authority to deploy troops jeopardizes federal immigration officers and government property amidst ongoing protests. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, however, strongly opposes the federal intervention, asserting the state's sovereignty and noting that lower courts found the administration's claims of a "rebellion" unsubstantiated. This high-stakes legal battle underscores a significant constitutional dispute regarding federal versus state control over military forces and responses to civil unrest.</p>

          <h2>Pharmaceutical Stocks Decline Following Trump's Proposed GLP-1 Drug Price Cap</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:25:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk experienced a significant drop after President Trump publicly stated his administration's ambition to cap the price of GLP-1 weight loss drugs at $150 per month, significantly below current prices. Trump highlighted a stark price disparity compared to other countries, citing a $1,300 cost in New York versus $130 in London, emphasizing a push to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed nations. While an administration official clarified that price negotiations are still in progress, the President's comments signaled aggressive intervention in drug pricing, which could profoundly impact the financial outlook for major pharmaceutical companies and the broader cash market for these popular medications.

          <p>The banking sector is grappling with heightened concerns over credit quality after regional banks, including Zions and Western Alliance, reported substantial losses from loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) due to alleged fraud. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of broader systemic risks, drawing comparisons to past financial crises. These loans to non-bank lenders have grown rapidly since the 2008 crisis, as regulations pushed riskier activities outside traditional banking. Investors are now intensely scrutinizing NDFI exposures, fearing that total wipeouts on even small loans could signal deeper, hidden vulnerabilities within the financial system, despite some analysts suggesting the recent stock selloff was an overreaction.

Zelenskyy, who had a separate call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stated that discussions about providing long-range weapons, such as Tomahawks, were kept private to avoid further escalation, despite Trump's earlier openness to a potential drone-for-Tomahawk exchange. Trump emphasized the urgency of stopping the bloodshed and reaching a deal, even suggesting Zelenskyy might join an upcoming meeting with Putin in Budapest, reflecting a complex diplomatic effort to end the protracted war.</p>

          <p>A collection of 17 iPad drawings by the renowned artist David Hockney, titled "The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate," achieved a remarkable £6.2 million at a Sotheby's auction in London. These digital prints, created in 2011, significantly exceeded their initial estimate, underscoring the strong market demand for Hockney's innovative work. Sotheby's described the sale as an "exceptionally rare opportunity" for collectors to acquire such a large group of his iPad creations, which were developed as a practical alternative to traditional plein air painting during winter. The successful auction reaffirms Hockney's enduring influence and the growing acceptance of digital art in the high-end market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a freeze on an additional $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects, specifically targeting "low priority" initiatives in Democratic-controlled states and cities. White House budget director Russell Vought indicated that these projects, many located in "sanctuary jurisdictions," could ultimately be canceled as a means to pressure Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown. This punitive action follows a previous freeze of $28 billion in federal funds for transportation and energy, intensifying the political battle and highlighting the administration's strategy of using federal resources to exert leverage over political opponents.

Del Taco, which Jack in the Box acquired in 2022, has recently faced financial struggles, including the temporary closure of numerous Colorado locations.

This updated "Teen Accounts" feature expands restrictions to hide posts about risky stunts and strong language from recommendations, and will conceal accounts that regularly share inappropriate material. While Meta claims the change addresses parental concerns and uses a familiar rating system, content moderation experts express skepticism about its simplistic approach, fearing it might inadvertently filter out appropriate discussions or creative expression for older teens.

While initial market reactions to these projections were positive, skepticism emerged regarding the achievability of such lofty goals and the potential risks associated with concentrating business with major customers like OpenAI.
