          <p>President Trump is reportedly seeking a deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, despite longstanding demands from some Republicans for Iran to dismantle its nuclear capabilities entirely. Negotiations, led by Steve Witkoff, aim to find a solution that addresses both sides' concerns about uranium enrichment, with Iran insisting on its right to civilian enrichment. The potential deal faces opposition from neoconservatives and Israel, who advocate for complete denuclearization. Sanctions relief and guarantees of U.S. adherence are key points of contention in the ongoing discussions.</p>

This offensive follows days of intensive strikes, resulting in numerous casualties. Meanwhile, Qatari and Egyptian-led negotiations are underway in Doha to broker a ceasefire and hostage exchange. The operation also comes as a severe humanitarian crisis persists in Gaza, with warnings of famine due to an ongoing blockade, prompting renewed efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would release the remaining hostages and end the blockade.</p>

The US Secretary of State said the Vatican could be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks after Pope Leo vowed to personally make ‚Äúevery effort‚Äù to help end the war.</p>

          <p>Democrats in Arizona are facing a challenging political landscape as Governor Katie Hobbs prepares for a difficult re-election campaign in 2026. The state party is dealing with internal strife, and Hobbs is likely to face a formidable Republican opponent. Hobbs's low-key approach and moderate stance have frustrated some Democrats, while her attempts to work with the Republican-controlled legislature have yielded limited results. Despite these challenges, Hobbs's defenders argue that her ability to stop Republican initiatives and a pro-business attitude could bolster her re-election chances.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson was the center of attention during Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester City. Henderson kept out Omar Marmoush's penalty by diving full stretch to his right among a string of fine saves, inspiring the Eagles to a 1-0 win at Wembley. But Henderson hesitated, before stretching out a hand outside the box to divert the ball away from the City striker. The VAR checked the incident and allowed play to continue without any sanction.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead of passing costs onto consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various goods could rise due to import duties. Trump argued that Walmart should sacrifice profits to support his economic agenda. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company will strive to keep prices as low as possible, but there's a limit to what they can bear given small retail margins.</p>
