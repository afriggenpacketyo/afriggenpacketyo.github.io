          <p>Millions of people across the U.S. and globally participated in "No Kings" rallies, protesting against the Trump administration's policies, which they view as authoritarian. While Republicans criticized these as "Hate America" rallies, demonstrations were largely peaceful, though some arrests occurred in Portland and near an ICE facility. Organizers, including MoveOn, emphasized a "fierce love for our country" as the motivation behind these widespread, anti-Trump gatherings. House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed the events as a distraction from the government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai unveiled a "T-Dome" missile shield plan, aiming to create a multilayered air defense network against potential Chinese attacks. The proposal, which draws inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome, seeks to protect critical infrastructure and population centers using advanced technologies like AI. However, the announcement surprised Taiwan's defense establishment, as the plan was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report nor allocated funds in the upcoming budget, raising questions about its feasibility and immediate implementation. This article suggests a significant, yet potentially aspirational, defense initiative.</p>

          <p>Fresh damaging reports have emerged regarding Prince Andrew, alleging he sought personal information about Virginia Giuffre through a police protection officer in 2011. This comes after Andrew agreed to renounce his remaining titles, including Duke of York, following intense pressure over his links to Jeffrey Epstein. Ms. Giuffre's brother has urged King Charles to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, while Prince William is reportedly dissatisfied with Andrew's current decision and desires a more ruthless approach, including a ban from future royal events. A posthumous memoir by Ms. Giuffre is also set for publication, expected to bring further attention to the allegations.</p>
