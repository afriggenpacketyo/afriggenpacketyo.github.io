          <p>Multiple sources have informed CBS News that Israel is reportedly prepared to launch an operation into Iran, leading the U.S. to anticipate potential Iranian retaliation targeting American sites in neighboring Iraq, prompting the U.S. to advise some Americans to leave the region. President Trump's Middle East envoy is still scheduled to meet with Iran for nuclear program talks, despite ongoing tensions. Iran's Defense Minister warned that if nuclear talks fail and conflict arises, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps would target U.S. bases in host countries, while the U.K. Maritime Trade Organization advised caution in key waterways due to increased regional tensions. The Trump administration seeks a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but disagreements persist over uranium enrichment terms. The current climate is tense, with the potential for escalation. Optimism for de-escalation is not high.</p>

          <p>David Hogg stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a "fundamental disagreement" with the party apparatus regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he will now focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision, despite escalating tensions between them. Hogg's departure follows a period of controversy surrounding his plan to support primary challenges against incumbent Democrats. The DNC will proceed with a re-do election for the vice chair position, with Malcolm Kenyatta now running unopposed. The situation has introduced some uncertainty within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is partially evacuating its embassy in Iraq, removing non-essential staff and their families due to heightened security risks amid rising tensions with Iran. U.S. officials indicated that Israel's readiness to potentially launch an operation into Iran is contributing to the decision, as Iran might retaliate against U.S. sites in Iraq. Despite the evacuation, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to meet with Iranian officials for nuclear program talks. President Trump reiterated that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, as the situation remains volatile.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a spending review that allocates an additional Â£29 billion per year to the NHS in England, alongside increased funding for defense and housing. The review prioritizes artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain." However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes. The government hopes increased spending in health and investment in longer-term projects will reassure voters, while Reeves has urged Labour MPs to promote the government's plans. The review reflects a balancing act between investment in key areas and fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>During a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Representative Linda Sanchez (D-CA) accused Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of interrupting her due to her gender, drawing audible groans from the room. The exchange occurred during a tense questioning session regarding the impact of tariffs enacted under President Trumpâ€™s administration. Sanchez claimed that Trump's tariffs were costing households $3,000 more for the same goods, a claim Bessent disputed.

The details, including the star's size, brightness, and color, were documented in a formal report to the Emperor Yongle. The rediscovered memorial has helped modern astronomers narrow down the star's possible position and confirmed the phenomenon as a nova rather than a comet or meteor.

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, emphasizing that the security pact must align with its "America First" agenda. Under the Aukus agreement, Australia is slated to acquire its first nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S., with the allies collaborating on creating a new fleet using cutting-edge technology. The review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending, and some analysts believe that the review may see the security pact shift its focus, away from submarines.

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability rating among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has dropped from 78% to 62%. Overall, the poll indicates that 30% of self-identified voters in the U.S. hold a favorable opinion of Musk, with significant divisions between Republican and Democratic voters. Musk's recent falling out with President Trump may have contributed to the decline in his favorability among Republicans.</p>
