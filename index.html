          <p>House Republicans have passed a major tax-and-spending bill, making permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts while introducing new provisions. The legislation increases the standard deduction, child tax credit, and state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, but also enacts significant spending cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The bill is projected to benefit higher earners while potentially harming low-income individuals who depend on the affected social safety nets. This article provides a detailed breakdown of the key changes and how they could affect personal finances. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's signature tax-and-spending bill, sending the legislation to his desk. The bill, which passed 218-214, makes trillions of dollars in tax cuts permanent and increases immigration enforcement spending, offset by major cuts to programs like Medicaid. The passage followed intense overnight negotiations to secure votes from a few Republican holdouts concerned about the national deficit. Democrats uniformly opposed the measure, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivering a record-breaking speech to decry its impact on lower-income Americans.</p>

          <p>Nissan has issued a recall for more than 480,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada because of a manufacturing defect that could cause the engine to fail while driving. The recall affects certain Altima, Rogue, and Infiniti QX50/QX55 models equipped with specific turbo engines where bearing failures may occur. Drivers might receive advance warning through abnormal engine noises or dashboard indicator lights. Dealers will inspect the engines for metal debris and perform necessary repairs or replacements free of charge, with owner notification letters being sent in August.</p>

          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental score of 269 by captain Shubman Gill. His performance anchored India's first-innings total of 587, putting immense pressure on the hosts at Edgbaston. In response, England's top order collapsed, leaving them at a precarious 77-3 by the close of day two. After their comeback victory in the first Test, England now faces a formidable challenge to avoid a series-leveling defeat against a resurgent Indian team whose bowlers found significant movement.</p>

          <p>In a direct phone call with President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that his military campaign in Ukraine will not cease until Russia's objectives are met. According to a Kremlin readout, Putin rejected the appeal for a ceasefire, emphasizing that Russia is determined to eliminate the 'root causes' of the conflict. The conversation took place shortly after the U.S. announced a halt on some arms shipments to Ukraine, a move some experts warn could embolden Putin. The two leaders also discussed the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>With the passage of the Republican budget bill, significant changes to American healthcare are imminent, particularly through over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid. The legislation introduces work requirements and alters program financing, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could cause nearly 12 million people to lose health insurance. This article argues that by enacting these changes, the Republican party now assumes political ownership of the nation's healthcare system and its ensuing problems. The author predicts these policies will lead to increased costs for all and set the stage for future political battles over healthcare.</p>

The 38-year-old son of the boxing legend was flagged as a public safety threat but was paroled into the country in January.

          <p>Edward Kelley, a Tennessee man who was pardoned by President Trump for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison for a separate federal case. Prosecutors stated that Kelley conspired to attack and assassinate FBI agents and other officials involved in his Jan. 6 investigation in an attempt to incite a 'civil war.' A jury convicted him of creating and distributing a 'kill list' of 36 law enforcement personnel. The presidential pardon did not cover this subsequent conspiracy conviction, and prosecutors argued Kelley showed no remorse.</p>

This article analyzes the current costs of a $150,000 home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While current average interest rates are nearly identical for both products, the key difference lies in their structure; home equity loans have fixed rates, while HELOCs have variable rates that can change over time. The analysis shows how small fluctuations in interest rates can alter monthly payments, highlighting the need for borrowers to consider long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two elderly female tourists, one from the U.K. and one from New Zealand, were killed by an elephant during a walking safari in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia. Police reported that a female elephant with its calf charged the group, and despite safari guides firing shots, they were unable to stop the attack. The victims were identified as 68-year-old Easton Janet Taylor and 67-year-old Alison Jean Taylor. This incident follows two separate fatal elephant attacks on American tourists in Zambia last year, highlighting the dangers posed by wildlife, particularly protective mother elephants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As American households face growing credit card debt with interest rates averaging nearly 22%, certain financial habits can significantly worsen the burden. This article outlines five common mistakes, including making only minimum payments, which can prolong repayment for decades and add thousands in interest. Other costly errors are ignoring the expiration of promotional 0% APR offers, using high-fee cash advances, and closing old credit cards, which can hurt credit scores. Falling even slightly behind on payments can trigger steep penalty APRs, making it crucial for consumers to manage their debt proactively. (not investment advice)</p>

At a time of rapidly rising electricity demand from AI data centers and electric vehicles, the bill removes key incentives for developing cheap, renewable power sources like wind and solar. The author contends this will stifle supply, leading to higher energy prices, more frequent blackouts, and disproportionate economic pain in Republican-leaning states that stood to benefit most from renewable energy projects.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's decision to strike Iran, despite vocal opposition from commentators like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, proves that these figures do not truly speak for the MAGA movement. Polling showed overwhelming Republican support for the strike, exposing the self-styled 'intellectual architects' of Trumpism as political entrepreneurs attempting to co-opt the president for their own agendas. The author asserts that 'Trumpism' is not a coherent ideology but is simply whatever Trump decides it is at any given moment. These commentators are presented as chumps who are used and discarded at the president's convenience.</p>
