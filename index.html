          <p>Bavarian State Premier Markus Söder has issued a stark warning about the rising popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, stating its goal is to divide and weaken the nation. Speaking at a folk festival, Söder cautioned that the AfD's ascent could "destroy" the country and rejected calls for a party ban, fearing it would create a "martyr status." Meanwhile, AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla expressed confidence in winning the 2029 federal election and advocated for mass deportations of migrants.</p>

          <p>China's export growth decelerated significantly in August, increasing by only 4.4% compared to the previous year, a notable drop from July's 7.2% jump. This slowdown is the weakest pace recorded since the beginning of the year, reflecting the impact of trade tensions and tariffs, particularly with the United States. Concurrently, Chinese exports to the U.S. fell by 33%, while imports from the U.S. dropped 16%. The country's substantial trade surplus remains a point of contention with its major trading partners.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim request from the Trump administration, allowing for the temporary removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. This decision pauses a lower court's order that had required Slaughter's reinstatement to her post at the independent agency. The Supreme Court will now take more time to consider the administration's full request. Slaughter had sued President Trump, arguing her removal violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, which specifies limited grounds for a commissioner's dismissal.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting attack occurred at a busy bus stop in north Jerusalem, resulting in the deaths of six people and leaving several others seriously wounded. Two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at the Ramot Junction before being neutralized by security forces at the scene. Israeli leaders condemned the violence, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stating the country is in a "full-scale war against terror." The U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas praised the attack, calling it a response to the ongoing conflict and Israeli military operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has indicated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to return their own citizens who have no right to be in the UK. This potential policy was discussed at a meeting of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance as a coordinated measure to address illegal migration. The announcement comes as the UK faces continued pressure over a significant increase in small boat crossings across the Channel, with over 30,000 arrivals recorded this year.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been discovered on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, and its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest in the city. The piece was quickly covered by authorities, citing the building's listed status, while police investigate the incident as criminal damage. Banksy authenticated the work via an Instagram post, continuing his tradition of creating politically charged and critical public art.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court dismissed Trump's claims of presidential immunity, finding no grounds to reconsider its previous holding on the matter and stating the damages were fair. This ruling pertains to defamatory statements Trump made in 2019 denying Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. The decision follows a separate $5 million verdict against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation in a related lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Amid a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are advising individuals who have lost their jobs on how to manage their student loan debt. Options for federal loan borrowers include enrolling in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower monthly payments, potentially to zero, based on current income like unemployment benefits. Borrowers may also qualify for deferment or forbearance to temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue. Those with private loans have fewer options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the primary factors that lenders consider when determining the terms of a personal loan offer, which many consumers use to consolidate high-interest debt. A strong credit score and history are paramount, as higher scores typically secure lower interest rates. Lenders also assess an applicant's debt-to-income ratio to ensure they can afford new payments, with a ratio below 35% being preferable. Other significant factors include the loan amount, the repayment term length, employment stability, and any existing relationship with the financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report has detailed a tense and profane confrontation between two Trump administration officials, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. At a private dinner, Bessent allegedly threatened to physically assault Pulte, accusing him of speaking negatively about him to President Trump. The feud reportedly stems from disagreements over a plan to privatize government-sponsored mortgage enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The incident, witnessed by other high-ranking officials, highlights significant internal friction within the administration.</p>

          <p>Brazil is experiencing deep political polarization as the Supreme Court prepares to deliver a verdict in the coup trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro. He is accused of orchestrating a plot to overturn the 2022 election results, a charge he denies.

          <p>An inquest into a fatal house explosion in Swansea has heard testimony from a next-door neighbor who reported smelling gas for weeks prior to the incident.

          <p>Officials in Italy are raising alarms after more than 100 people died in the country's mountains since June, an average of three deaths per day. Italy's national rescue organization attributes the high number of fatalities to hikers treating dangerous alpine trails too casually and being unprepared. Experts also point to the warming climate as a major contributing factor, with melting ice and permafrost leading to hazardous conditions like rockfalls and collapsing glaciers. Authorities are urging hikers to use proper equipment, monitor forecasts, and exercise extreme caution.</p>

Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for months, hiding near the course with a rifle before being spotted by a Secret Service agent.
