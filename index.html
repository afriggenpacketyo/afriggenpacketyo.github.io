          <p>China's Defence Ministry has issued a stark warning to the Philippines, cautioning against "self-inflicted destruction" for hosting U.S. missile systems. Beijing views the deployment, part of recent joint military exercises, as binding Manila to the "U.S. war machine" and a move that undermines regional security and stability. The statement escalates tensions over military alliances in the contested South China Sea, with China denouncing the introduction of such strategic weapons into the area.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is making a final push for a significant tax-and-spending bill that includes extending his first-term tax cuts and increasing funds for immigration enforcement. However, the bill's passage through the Senate is uncertain, with no mention of his previous July 4 deadline. The legislation is highly divisive, facing strong opposition from Democrats who have labeled it the "big, ugly betrayal" for its proposed cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, an initiative known as the "cool block" is testing innovative solutions to combat the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense areas become significantly hotter than greener ones. A local environmental group, GreenRoots, is transforming a single block by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting light colors, and painting rooftops white. This urban laboratory serves as a potential template for other cities to adapt to the extreme heat waves exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>The state of Florida is moving forward with the construction of a controversial migrant detention facility in the Everglades, which has been dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The project, which uses federal hurricane relief funds, is facing intense opposition from environmental groups and Native American tribes, who consider the site in the Big Cypress National Preserve to be sacred land. Critics have blasted the plan as a cruel political stunt that misuses emergency funds and threatens a fragile ecosystem.</p>
