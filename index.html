          <p>Korn Ferry Tour golfer Ryan McCormick employed a unique method to control his anger during a tournament round: taping his mouth shut. McCormick, who previously competed on the PGA Tour, admitted to struggling with his composure. He hoped this unusual approach would improve his behavior towards playing partners, communicating with his caddie via pen and paper. Ultimately, McCormick missed the cut, suggesting the method's ineffectiveness in improving his game. &#x3C;br&#x3E&#x3Cem&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C/em&#x3E</p>

          <p>Genetic testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy has raised concerns about the future of its users' genetic data.

          <p>President Trump's continued interest in acquiring Greenland has sparked controversy and legal debate. His statements about acquiring the territory, coupled with actions like sending Vice President Vance to Greenland, suggest a serious intent. Experts argue that seizing Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government would violate international law and potentially trigger a civil-military crisis. Military ethics professors suggest senior commanders have a moral obligation to refuse unlawful orders related to such an action.</p>

          <p>This newsletter discusses the incremental changes and enduring traditions in baseball. While the Yankees are now allowing beards, and fans can enjoy tiramisu in helmet-shaped containers, women still face barriers to playing serious baseball. The newsletter explores the history of women in baseball, the significance of eating during games, and the impact of "Moneyball" on the sport. It also notes the recent abandonment of the Yankees' long-standing prohibition of beards.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's tariffs may not easily lead to a manufacturing renaissance in the US. The tariffs have created uncertainty, and businesses are expected to proceed cautiously. While the tariffs may encourage some reshoring, issues such as workforce availability and a strong dollar remain challenges. The success of the tariffs depends on negotiations with other countries and significant investment in workforce training. &#x3Cbr&#x3E&#x3Cem&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C/em&#x3E</p>
