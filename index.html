          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes, held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park. The race mirrored the Kentucky Derby, with Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza finishing in the same order. Sovereignty's victory marks him as the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness, and then win the Belmont, a feat not seen since Thunder Gulch in 1995. Jockey Junior Alvarado, despite a recent fine, guided Sovereignty to victory in the 1 1/4-mile race, which was shortened due to the venue change, making it the same length as the Derby.</p>

          <p>A dispute between President Trump and Elon Musk has heightened uncertainty over NASA's budget, which is facing significant cuts that could impact numerous science missions. The proposed budget would slash funding for science projects by nearly half, potentially leading to the termination of 40 missions already in development or in space. While funding for Mars exploration has been boosted, other sectors face savings, raising concerns about the agency's overall focus. Experts warn that these cuts could represent a major crisis for the US space program, potentially shifting NASA's priorities towards lunar and Martian missions at the expense of other scientific endeavors.</p>

          <p>Victoria McCloud, a trans former judge, has voiced concerns that a recent Supreme Court ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts transgender people at risk.

She is planning to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the court did not hear from trans people before its decision.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is seeking information from Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding contingency plans if Elon Musk breaches his companies' contracts with the U.S. amid a public fallout with President Trump. Warren expressed concern that the feud could have serious implications for U.S. national security, citing Trump's proposal to terminate Musk's government contracts. She requested information on contingency plans for SpaceX and the impact on U.S. agencies' satellite communications if Musk's Starlink is turned off.</p>

          <p>Undocumented immigrants attending ICE check-in appointments at a federal building in Los Angeles were detained and held in the basement, some overnight. Immigration lawyers reported that hundreds of immigrants were detained, with dozens held in rooms with limited access to food and water. ICE refuted the allegations, stating they treat people in custody with dignity and as mandated by law, while DHS stated that those arrested had final orders of removal. The situation has drawn criticism from immigration advocates who describe the treatment as inhumane.</p>
