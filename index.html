          <p>A historic Gloria funicular cable car in Lisbon, Portugal, derailed and crashed, resulting in at least three deaths and 20 injuries. Emergency services reported that nine individuals are in serious condition, with several people initially trapped in the wreckage. The incident, which occurred near the Avenida da Liberdade, involved the iconic yellow tram overturning and colliding with a building. Opened in 1885, the funicular is a major tourist attraction and a key part of the city's public transport system, connecting the city center to the Bairro Alto neighborhood. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the derailment.</p>

          <p>A Long Island judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing, can be used as evidence in the trial of accused serial killer Rex Heuermann. This landmark decision marks the first time such evidence is admissible in a New York court, potentially setting a new statewide precedent for forensic science. Prosecutors utilized the technology to link hair strands found on victims to Heuermann and his family, a method the defense has challenged as inaccurate. The ruling is considered a significant victory for the prosecution, though the defense has filed a motion arguing the lab used is not licensed in New York.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has initiated a federal lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the rival conservative media outlet of engaging in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly in the right-leaning news market. The complaint alleges that Fox News coerces television distributors into exclusionary agreements that marginalize or block competing channels, thereby harming Newsmax's growth and market value. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction against these practices and triple the amount of damages sustained. A Fox News spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own competitive failures in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol to demand the full release of Justice Department records related to the federal investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The group, led by Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, is using a discharge petition to force a House vote on the matter, arguing that the public deserves complete transparency. During an emotional press conference, survivors shared their stories and urged President Trump to support their cause, countering his description of the issue as a "Democrat hoax."

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is demanding information from eight Democratic-led states regarding the cost of providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants through Medicaid. Citing a Congressional Budget Office estimate of $16.2 billion spent on emergency services for this population during the first three years of the Biden administration, Comer's inquiry seeks to uncover potential waste, fraud, and abuse. The letters, sent to governors in states like California and New York, request detailed data on enrollment and costs dating back to January 2019. The investigation highlights the financial strain that some states have faced due to public healthcare programs available to non-citizens.</p>

          <p>The Sphere in Las Vegas has premiered a 70-minute, technologically enhanced version of 'The Wizard of Oz,' transforming the classic film into an immersive theme-park-style attraction. The experience utilizes the venue's massive 16K LED screens, vibrating seats, and even scented foam to surround the audience in the world of Oz, costing roughly $100 million to adapt. While the spectacle of the tornado scene is a highlight, the review notes that the high-definition and expanded visuals can sometimes detract from the original's charm, making fantastical scenes feel smaller or revealing imperfections. With tickets starting at $114, the show represents a significant financial gamble for the $2.3 billion venue.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has publicly condemned the Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion, labeling the move "a step towards socialism." Paul argued that direct government ownership in private companies is a mistake and diminishes the free market principles of the Republican party. The investment is part of a broader trend of the administration taking a more interventionist role in the private sector, including stakes in other tech and materials companies. The White House defended the action, stating it ensures taxpayers benefit from federal investments aimed at protecting national and economic security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, argues that the United States should reduce its inflammatory rhetoric and defense investments based on the premise of an imminent Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The authors contend that such an invasion is "highly unlikely" due to a combination of strategic, political, economic, and military factors that make its success improbable. This analysis challenges the prevailing narrative in Washington, where officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have cited Chinese President Xi Jinping's directive for his military to be invasion-ready by 2027. The report suggests a shift in U.S. policy towards a more tempered approach to the cross-strait issue.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, savers with a significant sum like $25,000 are better served by certificates of deposit (CDs) or high-yield savings accounts. A comparison shows that for shorter terms, a high-yield savings account currently offers slightly higher returns, while for a six-month term, a CD provides a marginally better yield. However, the key difference is that CD rates are fixed for the term, guaranteeing the return, whereas high-yield savings account rates are variable and likely to decrease following expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. This makes CDs a more secure option for locking in current high rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met with his British counterpart Keir Starmer in London for their first bilateral meeting, signaling a reset in relations five years after Brexit. The leaders were expected to discuss strengthening trade ties, as well as key geopolitical issues including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Ahead of the meeting, Sanchez characterized Western policy on Gaza as a "failure" that risks creating a double standard compared to its response in Ukraine, potentially damaging its global credibility. The talks also come after the UK and Spain reached an agreement to ease border controls and create a customs union for the British territory of Gibraltar.</p>

Other Democrats accused him of seeking to ingratiate himself with tech billionaires like Elon Musk and questioned the relevance of a "fringe politician" from the UK testifying before Congress.</p>

She attributed the error to initial legal advice that did not properly account for a complex trust arrangement involving her family home in Greater Manchester, which was set up to provide for her disabled son. Rayner has stated she deeply regrets the mistake, has contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed, and has referred herself to the Prime Minister's standards adviser for investigation.

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 on September 17, mortgage rates may begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of monetary policy shifts. Historical precedent shows that mortgage rates have previously dropped just before a Fed rate reduction was formalized. With rates already on a gradual decline throughout 2025, and other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield also playing a role, borrowers may see relief sooner than the Fed's meeting date.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields declined after the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed fewer available positions in July than economists had anticipated. The 30-year Treasury bond yield, which had briefly surpassed the 5% mark due to tariff uncertainty and concerns over Federal Reserve independence, fell back to 4.891%. The weaker-than-expected jobs data suggests a potential cooling in the labor market, which can ease inflationary pressures and influence the central bank's interest rate policy. The bond market had previously seen a spike in yields following a federal court ruling against some of the Trump administration's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts suggest Apple might subtly raise prices by eliminating lower-storage entry-level models, forcing consumers into more expensive configurations. The potential price hike would also align with a broader industry trend of rising smartphone component costs and increasing average selling prices globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of over two decades of satellite data reveals that humanity is rapidly depleting freshwater resources, leading to expanding "mega-drying" regions across the globe. The study, published in Science Advances, identifies two main causes: rising global temperatures and the extensive overpumping of groundwater from aquifers. These drying areas, affecting nearly 6 billion people, are losing a volume of water annually that is more than double that of Lake Tahoe. This massive loss of terrestrial water is now a more significant contributor to sea level rise than the melting of mountain glaciers or polar ice sheets, posing dire long-term threats to food production, economic stability, and global security.</p>
