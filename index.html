          <p>Veterinary medicine is experiencing high demand due to increased pet ownership and shortages in the field, but faces challenges such as high student debt and alarming suicide rates among professionals. A recent survey indicated that many shelter animals in California lack adequate veterinary care, leading to overcrowding and euthanasia. The rising costs of veterinary care, driven by corporate investments, also create barriers for pet owners seeking affordable treatment, while students are well aware of the pressures that come with life-or-death decisions for beloved pets. Veterinary students find support through mentors and life experience, which they say is more important than scientific knowledge when it comes to succeeding in the field.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is investigating whether the Trump administration violated an order by deporting migrants to South Sudan, a country with a high risk of crime and conflict. Lawyers claim that at least 12 migrants were deported to the East African country, including one from Myanmar and another from Vietnam, despite court orders requiring due process and safety screenings. During a court hearing, a Justice Department lawyer stated that one migrant was deported to Myanmar, but declined to disclose the destination of the other, citing classified information. The judge warned of potential criminal contempt proceedings for officials who violated his order, and ordered the government to maintain custody of any affected deportees.</p>

EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the significance of Radio Free Europe in resisting authoritarian regimes, noting its role in delivering news to people under communist rule during the Cold War. The EU funding will focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus, aiming to support independent journalism in areas dependent on outside news sources. Radio Free Europe's lawyers have challenged the decision to cut their funding in court, although a temporary pause on the funding termination was blocked by a federal appeals court.</p>

          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but winning the Democratic primary is generally considered equivalent to winning the election in Pittsburgh. Gainey, the city‚Äôs first Black mayor, focused on affordable housing but faced criticisms over police leadership turnover and basic city services. O‚ÄôConnor campaigned on a pragmatic approach, promising to improve city services and rebuild the tax base, while seeking a more conciliatory relationship with local institutions.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the common practice among US presidents, including Joe Biden, of concealing the true state of their health from the public. A new book alleges that the political and media establishment in Washington covered up Biden‚Äôs declining mental health during his presidency. The recent announcement of Biden's aggressive form of prostate cancer has led some medical experts to suggest that the condition was known long before its public disclosure. This practice of hiding health issues is compared to that of aging dictators, raising questions about transparency and the public's right to know.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice due to receiving it as gifts, which was viewed as insensitive amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister. Eto's resignation comes as Ishiba prepares for an election and deals with public dissatisfaction over rising rice prices. The gaffe occurred shortly after the agriculture ministry decided to release rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has opened an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigation follows accusations that Cuomo lied to Congress about his involvement in drafting a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths. This development comes months after the DOJ dropped charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, one of Cuomo's rivals in the upcoming mayoral election. Cuomo's spokesperson denies any contact from law enforcement and calls the investigation "lawfare and election interference."</p>
