          <p>A 10-year-old boy in Houston, Texas, was critically injured after being shot while allegedly participating in a door-knocking prank. Police confirmed one person was detained for questioning following the incident, which occurred late Saturday night. This event mirrors a national 'Door Kicking Challenge' trend, prompting law enforcement in other states to warn parents about the serious consequences of such pranks. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the shooting, highlighting the potential dangers of these activities.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion, providing 30 hours per week for children aged nine months to four years. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a landmark moment for working families, nurseries report long waiting lists and staff shortages. Parents are struggling to secure places, with some even adjusting birth dates to meet eligibility criteria, underscoring significant logistical and financial hurdles in delivering the promised support. The sector requires 35,000 more staff, and rising fees for non-funded hours are deepening regional inequalities.</p>

          <p>Matcha, the green tea powder, is experiencing a global surge in popularity, leading to soaring prices and supply shortages even in Japan. Fueled by its superfood reputation on platforms like TikTok and a post-pandemic tourism boom, Japanese green tea exports quadrupled in a decade. The government is considering subsidies for farmers to increase tencha cultivation, the tea used for matcha, which is labor-intensive and facing a shortage of workers. Retailers are rationing supply, and producers worry that this summer's record heatwave could further impact next year's harvest, pushing prices even higher.</p>

Storms like Amy, Bram, and Chandra will be the first named systems, with selections reflecting diversity and often having personal stories behind them. This naming system, initiated in 2015, helps to communicate severe weather warnings clearly when storms are forecast to cause medium or high impacts, typically due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, or snow. The previous season saw a significant reduction in named storms compared to the year before.</p>

          <p>America's intelligence agencies report that China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) is the world's largest and most active spy agency, posing a significant cyber and human intelligence threat to the U.S. Former diplomat Jim Lewis states the MSS's operations have grown in scale and brazenness under President Xi Jinping, targeting U.S. government, private sector, and critical infrastructure. Beyond external threats, the MSS's primary focus remains surveilling and intimidating Chinese dissidents abroad, as evidenced by the discovery of an alleged overseas police station in New York City. Over 140 individuals have been indicted for China-related espionage and harassment in the U.S. in the last five years.</p>

          <p>Two New Orleans high school seniors, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, independently developed new trigonometric proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem, a mathematical feat previously thought impossible for 2,000 years. Their achievement, which garnered global attention and commendation from figures like Michelle Obama, was presented at an American Mathematical Society conference. Despite their groundbreaking work, both students, who have since graduated with scholarships, do not plan to pursue math careers, though Calcea may minor in the subject.

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), the world's largest spy agency, actively recruits agents in the U.S. to monitor its own citizens and foreign adversaries.

A key coercive tool is threatening family members back in China, a tactic unavailable to Western intelligence agencies.

          <p>A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck southeastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border late Sunday, with its epicenter 22 miles north of Bāsawul. The quake, which had a depth of 6.2 miles, resulted in 15 people being injured and taken to a local hospital. A second, smaller quake of magnitude 4.5 followed approximately 20 minutes later in the same province. Afghanistan is prone to seismic activity due to its location near tectonic plate junctions, having experienced a devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquake in October 2023 that killed thousands.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels stormed the offices of the World Food Programme and UNICEF in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, detaining at least 11 UN personnel. This action occurred a day after Israel claimed to have killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the Houthi prime minister, and other officials in a strike. UN Secretary-General António Guterres strongly condemned the detentions and forced entry, demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all arbitrarily held individuals. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that the strikes against Houthi leadership are "only the beginning" of their campaign, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Rachel, a 61-year-old caller on "The Ramsey Show," sought advice after financing her daughter's $27,000 car, with the loan and insurance remaining in her name a year later. Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey strongly advised against using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or other personal funds to pay off the debt, emphasizing that such generosity had inadvertently hurt her daughter by enabling irresponsibility. He recommended selling the car, covering any shortfall, and helping her daughter purchase a more affordable $5,000 vehicle instead. Ramsey stressed the importance of undoing the costly mistake rather than perpetuating it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, some of whom were already on planes. U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's ruling came after immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit, arguing the deportations would violate legal protections for minors and expose them to potential abuse or persecution. Government lawyers claimed the flights were reunifications requested by parents, but the judge found conflicting narratives. The order, lasting 14 days, mandates that children be deplaned and returned to U.S. custody while the legal process unfolds, highlighting a contentious legal battle over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, asserted that blocking the administration's sweeping tariffs would lead to "the end of the United States," following an appeals court ruling that deemed most of them unlawful. Navarro expressed optimism about appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, framing the outcome as critical for the nation's future. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Trump overstepped his authority in invoking a 1977 act to justify the tariffs, which were set to affect a significant portion of U.S. goods imports. Navarro reiterated Trump's claims that tariffs generate trillions, though economic analyses indicate American consumers bear the cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Anfield, with Dominik Szoboszlai scoring a magnificent 83rd-minute free-kick. Arsenal's conservative approach, despite significant transfer spending, drew criticism for failing to challenge Liverpool's defense effectively. Manager Mikel Arteta cited injuries to key players like Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, but the team's passive play until falling behind proved costly. This defeat extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield in the Premier League to 13 games, marking an early psychological blow in the title race and prompting questions about Arteta's strategy in big matches.</p>
