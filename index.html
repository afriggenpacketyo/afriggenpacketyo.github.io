          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving away from the North Carolina coast but continues to generate hazardous conditions along the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for life-threatening surf and rip currents, prompting officials to prohibit swimming at many beaches from the Carolinas to New England. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., storm surge warnings remain active for parts of the Outer Banks, which have already experienced tropical storm conditions. Gradual weakening is expected as the storm heads toward Atlantic Canada.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a warning to California, threatening to withhold federal funding from any school district that does not comply with the administration's policies on transgender athletes. The statement follows an incident where a high school girls' volleyball team forfeited a match against a team with a transgender player. This conflict highlights the ongoing clash between the administration's executive order, which aims to prevent biological males from competing in women's sports, and California's state laws enacted in 2013. Governor Gavin Newsom's office criticized the move as part of a culture war attacking students' safety and education.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration official. The allegations, publicly promoted by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, center on potential mortgage fraud, specifically claiming Cook declared two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. In response to the pressure, which includes a call for her resignation from President Trump, Cook stated she has no intention of being bullied into stepping down and is gathering information to address any legitimate questions about her financial history.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to patrol Washington, D.C., alongside police and National Guard members to oversee a federal anti-crime initiative. The move comes as the administration has significantly increased the presence of federal law enforcement in the city to address what it calls a crime emergency. However, local police data indicates that violent crime in D.C. has been on a decline for the past year and a half. The president has dismissed these statistics as "phony numbers," insisting that his administration's actions have made the city safer for residents.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom received a record 111,000 asylum applications in the year ending in June, surpassing the previous peak from 2002. Despite the record number of new claims, the government has increased its processing speed, reducing the overall backlog of cases to nearly half its 2023 peak. However, the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has seen a slight increase, remaining a significant challenge for the Labour government, which has pledged to clear the backlog and end hotel use. Most asylum claims came from individuals from Pakistan, while most small boat arrivals were from Afghanistan.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Stephen Miller's Immigration Focus May Undermine Broader Trump Agenda</h2>

          <p>This article presents an analysis arguing that White House advisor Stephen Miller's singular focus on mass deportations may be counterproductive to the Trump administration's broader authoritarian goals. The author suggests that militarized immigration crackdowns create the appearance of a police state without effective repressive capacity, thereby galvanizing public resistance. By prioritizing the removal of undocumented immigrants, Miller's policies are seen as alienating potential voters and generating significant opposition, which could ultimately weaken the administration's consolidation of power rather than strengthen it. The piece concludes that Miller's obsession is more about deportations than strategic political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>With the launch of its standalone ESPN streaming service, Disney has announced it will not publicly report subscriber numbers, a departure from the typical metric used to gauge streaming success. CEO Bob Iger stated that the company's focus will instead be on overall revenue and profits for the entire ESPN division, treating both cable and streaming customers agnostically. This strategy mirrors moves by other major companies like Apple and Netflix, which shifted investor focus away from unit sales or subscriber counts toward core financial performance. The decision aims to prioritize long-term profitability over potentially costly efforts to maximize subscriber growth.</p>

          <p>Retailer WH Smith saw its market value drop by nearly £600 million after its shares plunged 42% following the discovery of a significant accounting error. The company announced that profits at its North American division had been overstated by £30 million, primarily because income from supplier arrangements was recorded in the wrong financial year. As a result, WH Smith has cut its group profit forecast from an expected £140 million to around £110 million.

Simultaneously, many of these firms increased their investments in semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, betting on the long-term growth of artificial intelligence despite geopolitical tensions.

The deeply divided five-justice panel issued a complex series of opinions without a clear majority on the merits of the case.

While companies like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are investing heavily in U.S.-based production, the complexity, cost, and lengthy regulatory approval process for such facilities mean that a rapid onshoring of the pharmaceutical supply chain is not feasible.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the significant disadvantages of reverse mortgages, a financial product often marketed to seniors as a way to access home equity. Key drawbacks include high upfront fees and closing costs that can deplete the funds received. The loan balance grows over time as interest compounds, systematically reducing home equity and potentially leaving little inheritance for heirs. Furthermore, borrowers are still responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance; failing to meet these obligations can lead to foreclosure, posing a substantial risk for retirees on a fixed income.

This shift in consumer habits comes as rising food costs and economic pressures are causing some people to cut back on dining out.

          <p>Author and professor Walter Isaacson has characterized President Trump's recent dealings with chipmakers Intel and Nvidia as a "scattershot method of crony capitalism." Speaking on CNBC, Isaacson argued that this type of state capitalism, where the government favors specific companies, is a recipe for corruption and will not be successful in reviving American manufacturing. His comments come as the Trump administration pressures Intel's CEO to resign and has required Nvidia and AMD to pay a percentage of their China revenues to the U.S. government for export licenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled approximately $12.3 million in federal funding for California's sexual education programs, claiming the curriculum includes "radical gender ideology." The grant supports programs for about 13,000 youths in various facilities, including schools and homeless shelters. Federal officials cited examples from lesson plans that discuss transgender and gender non-conforming identities as being outside the grant's scope. California officials have refused to revise the materials, arguing they are medically accurate and were previously approved by the same federal agency, setting up another legal conflict between the state and the administration.</p>

          <p>The possibility of a direct summit between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky seems to be fading, despite recent diplomatic efforts championed by President Trump. While Moscow has appeared open to talks, it has attached preconditions, such as a Russian veto over Ukraine's security guarantees, that are unacceptable to Kyiv. Similarly, Ukraine insists on security guarantees from its allies that exclude Russia, a non-starter for the Kremlin. With both sides entrenched in their positions and accusing each other of undermining peace efforts, a high-stakes meeting between the two leaders remains unlikely for now.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents, are scheduled for separate parole board hearings this week. The brothers became eligible for parole after a judge recently reduced their sentences from life without parole to 50 years to life. They have long maintained that they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, a claim rejected by the jury at their trial. The Los Angeles District Attorney's office remains opposed to their release, arguing they have never fully accepted responsibility for the killings.</p>

          <p>Powerful waves generated by Hurricane Erin are threatening to destroy two beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, which appear close to collapsing into the Atlantic Ocean. Photos show the structures teetering on their support beams as high tides surge beneath them, highlighting the severe coastal erosion crisis in the Outer Banks. Since 2020, nearly a dozen neighboring homes have been lost to the sea. The National Park Service notes that many of these properties were built on land that is now regularly inundated by ocean water, a problem exacerbated by storms and rising sea levels.</p>

          <p>Though Hurricane Erin is remaining offshore, its outer bands are causing significant impacts along North Carolina's Outer Banks, including coastal flooding and dangerous rip currents. A storm surge warning is in effect, with forecasters warning of water levels up to four feet high, which has already breached dunes and closed Highway 12, the area's main thoroughfare. Evacuation orders were issued for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands, but the road closure has trapped some who remained. The storm is now moving northeast, away from the coast, but its effects are expected to continue impacting the mid-Atlantic.</p>

          <p>A contingent of AI safety researchers, often labeled "doomers," are expressing growing pessimism, warning that humanity has run out of time to implement necessary safeguards against advanced artificial intelligence. They argue the rapid pace of development by tech companies is creating systems that could soon become uncontrollable, with some predicting catastrophic or even extinction-level events within the next few years. This alarmism has been bolstered by recent AI models exhibiting strange and deceptive behaviors in simulations, which these researchers see as early signs of a technology spinning out of control. Their calls for caution contrast with the industry's competitive push to build ever more powerful systems.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the latest Home Office statistics reveals a complex picture of the UK government's asylum strategy. On one hand, officials are processing asylum claims more quickly, which has helped reduce the overall case backlog and lower the total cost of asylum support. On the other hand, the UK has seen a record number of new asylum applications, a significant increase in small boat arrivals, and only modest progress in ending the use of hotels to house asylum seekers. This mixed data presents both challenges and potential points of success for the government as it aims to demonstrate control over the immigration system.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic responds to a recent social media post from President Trump criticizing the Smithsonian for being too "WOKE." The piece humorously envisions Trump's perfect museum, one that avoids any mention of slavery or other difficult aspects of the past and instead focuses on "Success, Brightness, and the Future." The imagined exhibits include hoverboards, lightsabers, and a room full of mirrors that make visitors look thin. The satire critiques the president's perspective on American history and his desire for cultural institutions to present a purely positive and uncomplicated narrative of the nation.</p>

In a letter to the new company's CEO, Reps.

          <p>The Pentagon is actively recruiting its civilian employees to form a "volunteer force" to support the mass deportation operations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to a job posting and an internal email, the Department of Defense is asking staff to sign up for deployments of up to 180 days at immigration facilities across the U.S. to assist with tasks like data entry and logistical support. This initiative stems from a June memorandum authorizing the use of DoD civilian personnel to help DHS fulfill the president's immigration enforcement priorities, marking a significant expansion of the government's deportation infrastructure.</p>
