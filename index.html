          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking financial results for the second quarter, with operating profit soaring 68% and revenue hitting a new high. The surge is primarily attributed to sustained, strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. As a leading supplier to major tech companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix's performance highlights the ongoing boom in the AI sector and its significant impact on the global supply chain.

The plan also seeks to expedite the construction of data centers by easing environmental regulations and to promote the export of American AI technology, framing the initiative as a crucial competition against rivals like China.</p>

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in May that his name was mentioned multiple times in Department of Justice documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the full files, citing unverified hearsay and sensitive information about numerous high-profile individuals. The White House has dismissed the story as fake news, while the DOJ stated the briefing was routine and that nothing in the files warranted further investigation, though it has moved to unseal grand jury transcripts.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump's administration has implemented an aggressive immigration enforcement strategy, described as a "shock and awe" campaign. Fueled by a historic domestic enforcement budget passed by Congress, the administration is pursuing a mass deportation effort aimed at migrants living in the U.S. without legal status. This approach marks a significant and rapid shift in federal immigration policy, fulfilling a key campaign promise and dramatically altering the landscape of enforcement across the country.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's public pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy but a dangerous power play to subordinate the central bank to political needs. The author contends that while Powell's past performance has been flawed, forcing the Fed to lower interest rates to accommodate government borrowing—a concept known as fiscal dominance—historically leads to inflation and instability. The article concludes that the real issue is excessive government spending, and targeting the Fed's independence is a misguided approach that could erode market confidence.

          <p>Tesla has reported its second-quarter earnings, revealing a 12% drop in revenue to $22.5 billion and a 42% decrease in operating income compared to the same period last year. This marks the second consecutive quarter of declining financials for the electric vehicle maker. The company attributes the downturn to lower vehicle deliveries, reduced revenue from regulatory credits, and a decrease in the average selling price of its cars. Analysts suggest the brand's image has been negatively impacted by CEO Elon Musk's political activities, contributing to the sales slump.</p>

          <p>An inquest has concluded that former Sheffield United and Premier League footballer George Baldock died by accidental drowning. The 31-year-old was found deceased in the swimming pool at his home in Glyfada, Greece, in October 2024. A post-mortem examination found no traces of drugs or alcohol in his system. Baldock, a Buckinghamshire-born Greece international, had recently joined Greek club Panathinaikos after a seven-year tenure with Sheffield United, having also made over 100 appearances for MK Dons earlier in his career.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock fell sharply after the company lowered its same-store sales forecast for the year, now anticipating flat growth instead of a previously projected increase. The revision comes after the burrito chain experienced a second consecutive quarter of declining customer traffic, with same-store sales shrinking by 4%. Executives attribute the slowdown to a broader consumer pullback amid economic concerns, though they noted that sales trends began to turn positive in June and have continued into July, driven by new promotions.

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes which countries might intervene in a potential military conflict between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, concluding that very few would commit forces. On China's side, only treaty ally North Korea is obligated to help, while strategic partner Russia is unlikely to offer direct military aid. For the U.S., even close allies like Japan and the Philippines would likely offer limited, cautious support, such as patrols or logistical access, rather than full-scale combat involvement.

          <p>A report delves into the history of the word "OK," one of the most universally recognized terms on the planet. Scholars trace its origin to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston, where it first appeared in print as a playful, misspelled abbreviation for "oll korrect" (all correct). The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently matched the initials. Its simplicity and versatility allowed it to thrive in the telegraph age and spread globally with American influence.</p>
