          <p>Colombian senator and presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head during a campaign event in Bogot√°, raising concerns about a return to political violence ahead of the 2026 elections. The 39-year-old politician, a staunch critic of incumbent President Gustavo Petro and a prot√©g√© of controversial former president √Ålvaro Uribe, was attacked by a 15-year-old, and his condition remains serious after undergoing surgery. The incident has sparked condemnation across the political spectrum, with some blaming Petro for the country's deteriorating security situation, while others compare the attack to a dark era of political violence in Colombia's past. The Ministry of Defense has offered a substantial reward for information related to the assassination attempt.</p>

          <p>David Kirp argues that institutions are engaging in 'anticipatory compliance' by preemptively bending to Donald Trump's will, thus smoothing the path to autocracy. He advocates for 'anticipatory noncompliance' as a counter-strategy, highlighting examples of universities, states, and companies pushing back against Trump's demands. The article cites instances where institutions have challenged Trump's actions in education, law, and business, and points to rising popular opposition. The author emphasizes the need for sustained resistance through various tactics to restore democracy, drawing on James Baldwin's message that change requires facing challenges head-on.</p>

          <p>Kenneth L. Marcus argues that the recent surge in antisemitic violence in the United States is linked to Hamas and its terrorist ideology. He cites incidents such as the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado, and the murder of Israeli Embassy staff as examples of organized violence. Marcus contends that campus protests are part of a coordinated effort by professionals to carry out Hamas' plans of violence and the eradication of Jews and Israelis. He calls for a shift in strategy to hold perpetrators accountable for their criminal actions and disrupt the support and resources that enable these campaigns.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions through the discovery and distribution of misoprostol, a drug initially designed for stomach ulcers. Activists connected and spread the word about misoprostol, enabling women to end pregnancies despite legal restrictions in most Latin American countries. They established hotlines and published manuals, providing information and support for women seeking abortions. Accompaniment networks like Las Libres in Mexico and Socorristas en Red in Argentina emerged, offering comprehensive support throughout the abortion process and contributing to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>

          <p>In the case of Ames v. Ohio, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, was discriminated against when she was demoted and replaced by a gay man. The court's opinion, written by Justice Jackson, underscores the importance of treating individuals as individuals rather than as members of a group. This ruling is relevant to the debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) and the extent to which the law should provide assistance to targeted groups to increase diversity and overcome systemic discrimination. The ruling emphasizes the need to cease malicious discrimination but raises questions about affirmative action.</p>

          <p>In Vietnam, 'Cali' has become a derogatory term used by nationalists to criticize those perceived as opposing state policy or influenced by American imperialism. This trend is evident in reactions to the flag of South Vietnam, viewed as a symbol of American influence, and attacks on a U.S.-backed university. The government's control over media and education, along with the use of cyber troops, has bolstered nationalistic sentiment. While the government sometimes tries to rein in extreme nationalism, it also faces the challenge of balancing it with maintaining ties with the U.S.</p>

Columnists Anita Chabria and Mark Z. Barabak debate whether this is long-overdue introspection or just annoying self-pity. While Chabria argues that Democrats should focus on fighting for their ideals rather than self-immolating, Barabak suggests that self-reflection is good to a point but warns against over-interpreting the significance of one election.

          <p>Experts are increasingly concerned about the dire risk that near-shore tsunamis pose to California's heavily populated coastal communities. These tsunamis, triggered by earthquakes just offshore, could bring life-threatening waves in as little as 10 minutes. Data shows that locally generated tsunamis could reach heights of up to 30 feet in some areas, leaving little time for warning or evacuation. Despite the potential for devastation, many communities face challenges in evacuating quickly, and public confusion during a recent tsunami warning highlighted the need for better preparedness.</p>

          <p>A major tsunami poses a risk to the entire California coast, with potential for over 680,000 people in hazard areas and $12.6 billion in damage. The state faces two main types of tsunami scenarios: distant-source tsunamis from far-off earthquakes and near-source tsunamis that can strike within minutes of a local earthquake. Southern California could see over 350 casualties from a distant-source tsunami if evacuation is delayed, while the Bay Area could face over 1,300 casualties. The North Coast, particularly Del Norte County, is most exposed to tsunami risk due to its proximity to the Cascadia subduction zone.</p>
