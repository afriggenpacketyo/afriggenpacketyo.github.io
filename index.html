          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprise pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, narrowly beating Red Bull's Max Verstappen. This marks Russell's first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix and a significant result for Mercedes at a track where they haven't secured pole since 2018. The qualifying session was dramatic, with Russell brushing a wall on his fastest lap and Verstappen being impeded by Lando Norris, which may have cost him the top spot. The result sets up an intriguing race, with championship leader Oscar Piastri starting third.</p>

          <p>Israel has deported 137 international activists to Turkey following their detention during an attempt to break the maritime blockade of Gaza with an aid flotilla. The activists, part of the "Global Sumud Flotilla," were intercepted in international waters, an action condemned by world leaders as a breach of international law. Israel has labeled the participants "provocateurs" and alleged links to Hamas, claims which the activists deny. The interception and deportations have sparked large-scale protests in several countries, including Italy and Spain, in support of the Palestinian cause.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat known for its embedded green olives and pimentos, has largely vanished from American delicatessens and lunchboxes after its peak popularity from the 1940s to the 1970s. Once a cheap and visually distinct option for working-class families, its decline began in the 1970s with growing health concerns about processed meats, sodium, and preservatives. Changing consumer preferences towards fresher, more natural foods, along with the rise of microwaveable meals, further diminished its appeal. While some retain a nostalgic fondness for it, experts believe a significant comeback for the divisive deli meat is unlikely.</p>

While proponents highlight benefits like lower transaction costs, critics raise concerns about privacy, market volatility, and the potential for systemic financial crises. The article contrasts different regulatory approaches, from the UK's model seeking a balance between safety and innovation to Europe's state-involved strategy and the US's more hands-off approach. Experts warn that without robust oversight, a future crash involving private digital money is inevitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tony Blair's Potential Role in Post-War Gaza Meets with Regional Criticism</h2>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly being considered for a leading role in a post-war Gaza administration as part of a peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. This potential appointment has drawn significant criticism from Palestinian leaders and others, who point to Britain's troubled historical mandate over Palestine and Blair's controversial role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. Despite his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, his previous eight-year tenure as a Middle East envoy was widely seen as ineffective and biased towards Israel.

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza ceasefire proposal outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. In response, Israel stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, and President Trump urged an immediate halt to the bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe return of hostages. While Hamas's response is viewed as a positive step by the U.S., some elements of the deal, particularly concerning the future governance of Gaza, remain subject to further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. The plan calls for a phased Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of a technocratic Palestinian body to administer the territory.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human smuggling charges may constitute illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted an evidentiary hearing after Ábrego García's lawyers presented evidence suggesting the charges were brought against him because he successfully sued the Trump administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Judge Waverly Crenshaw highlighted "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general and the timing of the indictment, which followed a Supreme Court decision in Ábrego García's favor. The case underscores the intense partisan conflict surrounding the Trump administration's immigration and deportation policies.</p>

The attack involved two strikes, with the second occurring during the evacuation process, which Ukrainian Railways called a "vile" attempt to disrupt frontline communications.

          <p>A significant drop in international student enrollment is creating severe economic challenges for small U.S. college towns that rely on the revenue these students bring. The decline is attributed to several factors, including lingering effects of the pandemic and, more recently, the Trump administration's stricter screening processes and crackdown on campus protests, which has created fear of arrest and deportation. Universities like Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have seen international student numbers plummet, leading to potential losses of over $100 million for the local economy. This trend threatens the financial stability of smaller schools and the vitality of the communities they support.</p>

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, was unable to be sworn into Congress this week by Speaker Mike Johnson, leaving her constituents without representation. Grijalva suspects the delay is politically motivated, as her signature is the final one needed on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move opposed by Johnson and Donald Trump. While the House was not in full session due to the government shutdown, a brief procedural session was held where she could have been sworn in, as two Republicans were previously. A spokesperson for Johnson indicated she will be sworn in when the government reopens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 U.S. states have charged 412 people with "pregnancy-related crimes," according to new research from the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice. The majority of these cases involve low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy, often using laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which critics warn could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals for a wide range of behaviors. Experts express concern that the U.S. may be following the model of countries like El Salvador, where pregnancy is aggressively policed.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has emerged as the court's most prolific dissenter, using her written opinions to issue stark warnings about threats to the rule of law in the United States. In a notable dissent against a ruling that expanded presidential power, she decried the decision as an "existential threat" and cited a book analyzing the legal structure of Nazi Germany, drawing a parallel to the current judicial drift. Legal scholars interpret her forceful dissents not just as legal arguments but as direct messages to the American public and lower courts about the dangers of unchecked executive power and a judiciary that enables it.</p>

Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's powerful vision, which included an obsessive focus on the customer experience and a bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000. Risher, who became a senior vice president, was instrumental in expanding Amazon beyond books into new categories like music and movies. Amazon ultimately surpassed Bezos's goal, hitting $1.6 billion in revenue in 1999, validating Risher's risky but rewarding career change.</p>

Authorities have not yet identified who is responsible for the incursions, which have raised security concerns among European leaders.

          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is rapidly expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This revival is driven by the projected electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, coupled with a looming ban on Russian uranium imports by 2028. After a decade of decline following the Fukushima disaster, the industry is now facing a supply gap, prompting Urenco to increase its capacity by 15%. However, the entire nuclear supply chain, particularly uranium conversion, faces bottlenecks that must be addressed to support ambitious national goals for nuclear energy expansion.

Leader Kemi Badenoch has failed to generate momentum, and the party is struggling to define itself as the main opposition, with the Labour government focusing its attacks on the rising Reform UK party. Internal criticism is mounting over Badenoch's leadership style and pace, with some members suggesting she is not connecting with voters or the party base. The conference is seen as a crucial opportunity for Badenoch to assert her vision and convince both her party and the public that the Conservatives still matter.</p>

Her diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma, without any prior symptoms, highlights the importance of personal risk awareness and self-advocacy.

          <p>A public controversy over the use of pre-made and semi-processed foods in Chinese restaurants has erupted, raising concerns about transparency and quality in the nation's catering industry. The debate was ignited when a well-known influencer accused the popular Xibei restaurant chain of serving "disgusting" pre-made meals at premium prices. This has put the industry under intense scrutiny as it struggles with slowing growth compared to previous years. While restaurant owners defend the practice as a necessary cost-saving measure to survive, consumers are increasingly demanding to know whether their meals are freshly prepared or simply reheated from a package.</p>

Her journey began as a young woman with no college experience who convinced anthropologist Louis Leakey to let her study chimpanzees in Africa. Her groundbreaking discovery in 1960 that chimps make and use tools shattered the long-held belief that this was a uniquely human trait, forcing a redefinition of humankind. Goodall's work extended beyond research into global conservation efforts, establishing animal sanctuaries and forest preservation programs, leaving a legacy of empathy and interspecies connection.</p>
