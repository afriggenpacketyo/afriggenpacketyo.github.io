          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council reports that Sudanese people are resorting to eating leaves and charcoal to survive after fleeing an attack on the Zamzam camp near El-Fasher. People are dying of thirst and exhaustion while traveling to Tawila, with reports of bodies along the route. One family recounted the story of a girl who was repeatedly subjected to sexual assault during her journey and later died from her wounds. El-Fasher remains the last city in Darfur under army control, while the RSF denies atrocities despite attacking the Zamzam camp, which has been completely destroyed.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI for allegedly obstructing an immigration arrest operation, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from Eduardo Flores Ruiz, an undocumented immigrant, allowing him to initially evade arrest. While Flores Ruiz was later apprehended, Patel stated that Dugan's actions created increased danger to the public. The arrest highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the potential for conflicts between federal agents and local officials.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos faces sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, arguing that Santos lied, stole, and defrauded voters and donors, making a mockery of the election system. Santos, who helped Republicans secure the House in 2022, was ousted from Congress after the House Ethics Committee detailed his misconduct. He faces a stiff sentence and has requested solitary confinement, and he agreed to pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he has spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping "many times," amidst conflicting reports regarding trade talks and tariff reductions. Trump hinted at potentially cutting tariffs "substantially" from 145%, but China denied any ongoing consultations or negotiations. The comments follow days of back-and-forth between the countries over whether they are in direct talks about reducing the tariffs, which have rattled global stock markets and upended supply chains.

Scientists believe the case helps the caterpillar feast on the spider's meals without being detected.

          <p>Wildlife charities are enlisting volunteers to locate glow-in-the-dark caterpillars at night using ultraviolet lights, aiming to expedite butterfly and moth surveys and uncover details about their behavior and evolution. The surveys are part of a conservation initiative covering Bernwood Forest, the River Ray, and Otmoor Basin near Oxford. The new technique could change our understanding of their biology, distribution, abundance and ecology. The first group of volunteers searched for caterpillars of the UK's five species of hairstreak butterfly.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to the internet via an unsecured commercial line, known as a "dirty line." This line lacked the firewall protections of the Defense Department's systems, potentially making it susceptible to monitoring. The revelation follows Hegseth's denial of sharing classified war plans over Signal and accusations of mismanagement within his office. The use of an unsecured line raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities and the handling of sensitive information.</p>

This decision allows the FDA to take action against pharmacies making compounded versions, protecting patient safety and Novo Nordisk's market share.
