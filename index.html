          <p>This article discusses the benefits of air conditioning, arguing it's more than just a luxury in today's world. Air conditioning saves lives by preventing heat-related deaths, boosts productivity in workplaces and schools, and improves sleep quality. It has also enabled technological advancements like movie theaters and microchips, and has allowed for the development of cities in hot climates, offering people more choices in where they live. The author concludes that better, more efficient air conditioning is needed rather than less, especially as the world warms. The author points out that the choice to use air conditioning should be a personal one.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with failing heart function and an LVAD, received a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, after facing dangerous heart rhythms and high antibody levels, which made finding a matching heart difficult. Dr. Pareg Patel and his team decided on the liver transplant to reduce the antibodies, making her eligible for a heart transplant, a procedure never before done on someone with an LVAD. Baker's surgery was successful, and she was also able to donate her healthy liver to another patient, but she is now facing financial difficulties after her husband's sudden death and ongoing medical expenses. Her story highlights the potential for innovative solutions in transplant medicine and the financial challenges faced by many patients after receiving lifesaving treatments.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, reducing reliance on foreign software and enhancing small satellite performance. The Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat used OpenHarmony for over 1,000 hours of in-orbit testing, demonstrating faster data updates and improved stability. The satellite also ran on a domestically produced chip, achieving a fully home-grown hardware-software solution. Yu Xiaozhou and colleagues are proposing national technical standards to promote the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in Chinese satellite missions.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans in the U.S. face potential deportation due to the Trump administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS), causing fear and uncertainty within the Afghan community.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 07:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested that Japan raise its defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, a demand that may lead to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting between the two countries. The request was made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, who had previously advocated for a 3% target. The increased demand is likely to cause Japan to postpone a meeting of foreign and defense chiefs, scheduled before the upcoming House of Councillors election. The U.S. continues to assert that the U.S.-Japan security treaty is one-sided, with plans to ask Tokyo to increase payments for American troops stationed in Japan.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the Minnesota shootings, where a gunman killed a former state house speaker and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife, arguing that the tragedy reflects the divisive character of the Trump era. The author criticizes the immediate right-wing response that falsely linked the shooter to the left, and examines the shooter's background, linking him to anti-abortion extremism and the New Apostolic Reformation. The author also contrasts the shooter's background with that of Senator Mike Lee, who promoted disinformation after the shooting, arguing that both men embody parallel lives that have intersected at the tragedy under the influence of Trump.</p>

          <p>This article examines how Donald Trump has commercialized politics, blurring the lines between business and the presidency to an unprecedented extent. Trump's business ventures, such as the launch of Trump Mobile, are seen as reinforcing his political persona and playing off Maga patriotism. The article highlights concerns about the lack of separation between power and profit, as well as the acceleration of post-ethical politics. The article also mentions Trump's various branded products, real estate projects, and the involvement of his family in financial ventures, noting that these activities contribute to his image as a results-oriented executive blending capitalism with populism.

          <p>This article reviews Pip Adamâ€™s novel 'Audition,' which uses the setting of outer space to explore alternative forms of human connection and escape the prejudices and hierarchies of Earth. The story follows three giants confined on a spaceship, forced to speak to power the ship while their language is corrupted and transformed into a means of exploitation. As they approach a black hole, they realize the shared damage and violence that bonds them, and ultimately find a new world where they can form unheard-of associations and discover unknown pleasures. The review contrasts this vision with the utopian dreams of billionaires like Bezos and Musk, suggesting that true possibility lies beyond the cages that separate and constrain life on Earth.</p>

          <p>This NPR article reviews Celine Song's film 'Materialists,' a romantic drama about a matchmaker caught between two men, and critiques its use of a sexual assault subplot. The author finds the inclusion of a client's sexual assault jarring and questions its purpose as a plot device to facilitate the protagonist's emotional growth. While not as exploitative as other films, the author suggests that the film's use of trauma feels cynical and undermines its rom-com marketing. Despite these shortcomings, the author remains eager to see Song's future work.</p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now asserts that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon "within weeks," a shift from her previous congressional testimony stating Iran was not actively building such weapons.

Gabbard's initial testimony has faced criticism, with Trump dismissing her claims and US intelligence agencies later asserting Iran's advanced nuclear capabilities.

The author contrasts the team's current actions with the support shown by other members of the Dodgers family, such as Maria Valenzuela and Jaime JarrÃ­n, and criticizes the lack of response from current players.</p>
