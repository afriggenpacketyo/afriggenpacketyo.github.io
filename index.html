        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed U.S. law, Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is causing concern on Wall Street due to its potential to transform trade disputes into capital wars by taxing foreign holdings of U.S. assets. Investment banks and law firms are warning that this bill, which has passed the House and awaits Senate approval, could significantly alter the treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. The legislation targets entities from "discriminatory foreign countries" that impose levies disproportionately affecting U.S. companies, such as digital services taxes. France's 3% tax on online platform revenues, aimed at tech giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, exemplifies the type of levy targeted by this bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Doyle, a former Royal Marine, appeared in Liverpool Crown Court facing multiple charges, including wounding with intent and dangerous driving, related to an incident after Liverpool FC's trophy parade where his car drove into a crowd injuring 79 people, including two children. Doyle did not respond to the charges, and a plea and trial preparation hearing is scheduled for August 12, with a provisional trial date set for November 24. The investigation is ongoing, and the charges may change as authorities continue to interview witnesses and review footage.

The agreement, announced on May 12, had lowered tariffs on imports between the two countries. Trump stated that he made a "fast deal" to "save China" from economic difficulties caused by his tariffs, but now claims China has "totally violated its agreement."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies have given rise to two market trends: "Taco" (Trump always chickens out) and "Tina" (There is no alternative). The Taco trade involves selling at-risk assets when Trump threatens high tariffs and rebuying them when he backs down, capitalizing on the expected value increase. Despite market volatility caused by Trump's tactics, many investors still believe there is no alternative to investing in US assets, thus trusting in "Tina". The S&P 500's performance has reflected this pattern, declining after tariff announcements and rebounding after pauses.</p>

O'Leary has been with Ryanair since 1988 and has served as chief executive since 1994, spearheading the airline's growth into Europe's largest low-cost carrier. Ryanair emphasized that the share price aspect of the bonus is only one of two conditions, with the other being O'Leary's continued employment with the airline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has fired tenured professor Francesca Gino for falsifying data in multiple published papers, marking the first time in at least 80 years that the university has taken such action. The accusations against Gino, whose academic focus was honesty in business, surfaced in 2023 with a series of posts on Data Colada detailing her apparent data manipulation. Gino's denials were unconvincing, and her subsequent lawsuit against Harvard and the Data Colada authors was dismissed. Harvard's handling of the Gino case is seen as a positive step towards addressing scientific fraud, though it highlights the need for academia to improve fraud detection and punishment.</p>

After a recent agreement in Switzerland to roll back tariff increases for 90 days, the U.S. has continued tech restrictions on Beijing, while China has yet to ease restrictions on rare earths. Bessent believes the complexity of the talks necessitates leaders to weigh in, noting Trump and Xi's good relationship.

          <p>Enormous wildfires in Canada's prairie provinces are causing dangerous air quality across eastern North America. The largest fires, the Bird River fire and the Border fire, are uncontained in northern Manitoba, leading to the evacuation of over 17,000 people. Weather forecasts predict smoke will continue to spread into the United States, potentially worsening air quality in cities like Chicago and Washington DC. The fires have been intensified by prolonged warm and dry conditions, worsened by climate change, and have already impacted First Nations communities and oil production in Alberta.</p>

          <p>Zhou Zhongpeng, a former Peking University doctoral student turned tech engineer, has deciphered Inter-universal Teichmueller Theory (IUT), a complex mathematical framework that has baffled experts for years. Zhou's breakthrough may transform the ABC conjecture from a conceptual abstraction to a computationally usable tool. The feat was achieved during weekends between grueling 14-hour shifts as an algorithm engineer. Professor Ivan Fesenko, a leading IUT authority, declared that Zhou's results are infinitely stronger than Andrew Wilesâ€™ famed 1995 proof of Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly attempting a "reverse Nixon" strategy, aiming to draw Russia closer to the United States to gain an advantage over China. The goal is to isolate China, guarantee European security, and solidify American global primacy. However, this plan could backfire, given the existing strong ties between Russia and China, including economic links. Experts suggest that Putin may not be willing to break free from China, and the effort could ultimately strengthen both Putin and Xi's positions against the United States.</p>

          <p>Christina Ramberg, an artist affiliated with the Chicago Imagists, explored the artifice of the female body and the contradictions of femininity through her paintings. Her work often featured torsos in corsets, feet in high heels, and intricate updos, rendered in a crisp, flat style that lacked faces. These images, while sensual, are also depersonalized and often off-kilter, reflecting the taming and unruly forces that divide women's bodies. Ramberg's art probes the commodification of female sexuality and the artificiality inherent in self-presentation.</p>

          <p>NiccolÃ² Machiavelli is often viewed as advocating ruthless pragmatism, but this interpretation is incomplete, according to political philosopher Erica Benner. Benner argues that Machiavelli's famous work, The Prince, is not a manual for tyrants but a satirical critique of authoritarian power. She suggests that Machiavelli was a republican who believed in shared power and cautioned against the dangers of inequality and partisanship. Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy further supports this view, espousing a deep belief in republicanism and representative government.</p>

The report identifies the Amazon Fire Stick as a key device used to access illegal streams.

Founded in 2015 as a research lab focused on safe and beneficial AI, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to attract investors. However, the success of ChatGPT has led to concerns about the company's original mission, resulting in a proposed transition to a for-profit structure, which was later revised to maintain nonprofit control. Critics, including Elon Musk and Nobel laureates, question whether the current structure can effectively ensure the safe and beneficial development of AI.</p>
