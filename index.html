          <p>An article highlights the growing trend of young entrepreneurs using "search funds" to acquire existing small and medium-sized businesses, rather than starting new ventures. This investment vehicle allows individuals to raise capital to buy established companies, often from retiring baby boomers who lack succession plans. The model offers lower risk and significant returns, revitalizing local economies and providing a practical path to business ownership and wealth creation for a new generation.

          <p>European stock markets are broadly anticipated to open higher on Friday, as investors keenly await a crucial U.S. jobs report expected to influence Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations. Global equities and bonds initially saw a sell-off earlier in the week due to concerns over government debt, but sentiment brightened following Thursday's U.S. payrolls data. This data boosted market bets on a September Fed rate cut without fueling fears of a severe economic downturn, leading to hopes for another "Goldilocks" reading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Official figures indicate that UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, surpassing analysts' predictions. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) cited sunny weather and the women's Euro football tournament as key drivers for this boost. Despite this monthly rise, sales over the three months to July showed a slight decline, with strong online and clothing sales partially offsetting a fall in supermarket and household goods spending. The ONS director general apologized for past data errors, assuring improvement plans are in place.</p>

          <p>Italy is becoming a favored destination for the ultra-wealthy, thanks to its investor-friendly environment and an accommodative flat-tax regime on foreign income. This policy has spurred a real estate boom, particularly in Milan and surrounding lake regions, with property prices reaching all-time highs. While other nations are tightening regulations on the super-rich, Italy's approach is drawing significant investment and fostering new businesses catering to this affluent influx. This trend, however, has raised questions about worsening wealth inequalities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's order to cease operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, allowing it to continue holding detainees. The facility, built by Governor Ron DeSantis' administration to support President Trump's deportation efforts, faced a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe over a lack of federal environmental review. Despite the temporary reprieve, plaintiffs vow to continue their legal challenge, arguing the facility harms the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and will ultimately be shut down.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department is exploring the possibility of authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges to address a backlog of over 3.4 million cases. This initiative follows the Trump administration's loosening of job requirements for these roles, allowing a broader group of government lawyers to participate. Critics, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association, warn that this move could undermine due process and the integrity of the immigration court system due to the complexity of immigration law and the lack of specialized experience among military lawyers.</p>

          <p>This article critically examines President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense to the "Department of War," arguing it's a performative and inane move. It provides historical context, noting the post-WWII shift to "Defense" reflected a broader national security understanding and was supported by combat-veteran presidents like Truman and Eisenhower. The author suggests the change reflects a simplistic "tough guy" image, contrasting it with the thoughtful decisions of past leaders and the naming conventions of other major global powers like China and Russia.</p>
