            <p>French luxury brand Hermès will be increasing its prices in the United States starting in May to counteract the impact of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The price adjustments will specifically target the American market, with no planned increases in other regions. The company is best known for its Birkin and Kelly handbags, as well as its scarves, which retail for hundreds of dollars. The price increase is intended to offset the 10% tariff imposed by the White House in early April.</p>

            <p>The family of Mohd F. Hijaz, who died after an encounter with San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies, is suing the city and the Sheriff’s Department, alleging excessive force and wrongful death. Deputies responded to a report of a person "in distress and behaving erratically" and used tasers and baton strikes on Hijaz, who was unarmed. The lawsuit claims the deputies slammed Hijaz's head onto the pavement, leading to his death. The family's lawyer alleges the autopsy report, body camera footage, and surveillance footage have not been released.</p>

            <p>Southern California home price growth has slowed, with the average home price rising only slightly in March. Economists attribute this trend to high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and economic uncertainty related to tariffs. Zillow reports that the housing market is no longer a seller's market, with more owners listing their homes. Some experts predict that home prices could decrease in the coming years due to rising inventory and potential economic recession.</p>
