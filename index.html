          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, scheduled to take effect on August 1, 2025. President Trump stated the decision followed a national security assessment, emphasizing copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other key technologies. The United States currently imports nearly half of its copper, with Chile being the primary supplier. This move follows a national security probe into copper imports that was initiated by the administration earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the second such attack in two years, with the first occurring on New Year's Eve 2024. The homeowner plans to install a security system rather than remove the displays.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, effective next month, in a move President Trump linked to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump described the legal action against his political ally as an "international disgrace" and a "Witch Hunt." The letter also criticized Brazil for alleged unfair trade practices and attacks on American digital companies. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has indicated that his country will respond with countermeasures based on its economic reciprocity law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's stringent animal cruelty laws for egg-laying hens are causing inflated egg prices nationwide. The suit claims that state ballot initiatives mandating larger enclosures for hens are preempted by federal law and constitute "unnecessary red tape." The administration contends these laws have decreased egg production and increased prices, while supporters argue they are vital for preventing inhumane conditions. Governor Gavin Newsom's office dismissed the lawsuit as a political move by the president.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents for their roles in the security failures during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, affect personnel from supervisory to line agent levels. This disciplinary action follows a Department of Homeland Security review which found the Secret Service had become "complacent" and was not performing at elite levels. The shooting incident resulted in the death of a firefighter and the then-candidate being injured.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Wales are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations against two former figures of the Church in Wales, including a convicted bishop. The investigation involves Anthony Pierce, a former Bishop of Swansea and Brecon who was jailed earlier this year for child sexual abuse, and another former vicar. One victim has spoken publicly, questioning how Pierce was promoted to bishop despite concerns being reported to church officials as early as 1986. Victims are now calling for a full independent inquiry into abuse within the Church in Wales.</p>

          <p>The cost of all-inclusive family package holidays from the UK has significantly increased for popular destinations like Spain, Cyprus, and Turkey. According to data compiled for the BBC, a one-week trip to Cyprus in August is now 23% more expensive than last year. The United Arab Emirates saw the largest price jump at 26%. Travel industry experts attribute the increases to higher operational costs for hotels and restaurants, including energy, food, and wages. In response, some holidaymakers are opting for shorter trips or mid-week travel to manage expenses.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging the state violates Title IX by allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's and girls' sports. The complaint argues this policy illegally discriminates against female student-athletes by denying them equal athletic opportunities. The lawsuit names the California Department of Education and the state's interscholastic sports governing body. This legal action aligns with a recent executive order from President Trump banning transgender athletes from women's sports and is part of a broader national debate on the issue.</p>

Menzies, who was convicted for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker, chose execution by firing squad decades ago. His lawyers are appealing the decision, arguing his cognitive decline is so severe that he cannot rationally understand his sentence, which could make his execution unconstitutional.

Although still considered a risk asset, Bitcoin's rise reflects a broader "risk-on" sentiment among investors. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential for crypto-friendly legislation could continue to fuel bullish sentiment for the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the ongoing political complications for the Trump administration arising from conspiracy theories surrounding the late Jeffrey Epstein. Before taking office, some high-ranking officials had fueled theories about a "deep state" cover-up of Epstein's connections. Now in power, the Department of Justice has stated there is no secret information to release, a declaration that only deepens the conviction of conspiracy theorists. This situation creates a difficult paradox for the administration, as it must now debunk the very narratives that some of its allies once promoted.</p>
