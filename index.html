The program aims to seed index fund accounts with $1,000 for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, with additional contributions allowed annually, and the funds can be used for expenses like college or a down payment on a home.

          <p>In response to ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, approximately 700 Marines have been activated to join around 2,100 National Guard soldiers, forming Task Force 51.

They are not authorized to patrol streets, engage with protesters, or detain rioters on behalf of the police. The deployed personnel are equipped with ammunition for self-defense but are not using rubber bullets or pepper spray, according to U.S. officials, and the activation comes amid heightened tensions following recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the city.</p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over its demand that school districts ban transgender athletes from competing in sports, alleging that the federal agency has overstepped its authority. Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the Trump administration is demanding that schools violate state law and discriminate against students. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the constitutionality of California's anti-discrimination laws protecting transgender athletes and prevent the federal government from retaliating against schools that do not comply with the administration's directive. The legal battle highlights the growing conflict over transgender rights and equal protection under the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Rugby league legend Billy Boston is set to be knighted at Buckingham Palace, marking the sport's first knighthood in its 130-year history. The honor is being awarded early due to concerns about Boston's health, and the Cardiff-born player, now 90, was a star for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy called the knighthood an "historic milestone," and Boston is expected to be accompanied by his family and representatives from his former club.</p>

          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, expressing concerns that research is being politicized and that budget and staff cuts are hindering the agency's work. The letter calls for the reinstatement of staff and the restoration of funding, with signatories stating they have tried to raise these concerns internally without success. The NIH scientists are concerned about the risk of not speaking up and are calling for change, particularly as NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya is set to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, and demonstrators have clashed with police in downtown LA, where five self-driving vehicles were set on fire. Governor Newsom has sued the Trump administration, claiming the federal government illegally federalized the National Guard, and the situation has drawn criticism and concern from state and local officials.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on the set of the film *It Ends with Us*. Lively filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios in December 2024, alleging she was sexually harassed on set and that Baldoni retaliated against her for bringing those complaints, among other allegations. The judge determined that Baldoni and his company had not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion and had not proved defamation. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication for Lively.</p>
