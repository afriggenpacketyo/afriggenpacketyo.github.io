        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's attorney is requesting that the appeal of his New York hush money conviction be moved from state appellate courts to federal court, arguing that a federal officer is entitled to a federal forum. The attorney argued that the Supreme Court's ruling granting presidential immunity for official acts should apply, potentially preventing the conviction. The Manhattan district attorney's office contends that it is too late to move the case and that the trial involved discussions about actions before Trump became president. The appeals court will consider the arguments before making a ruling, and the case could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The conviction would remain even if the appeal moves to federal court.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a deal with China has been reached, pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. According to Trump, China will supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US will roll back threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. The agreement follows intense talks in London to resolve conflicts that emerged after a truce in May. While details are limited, officials suggest the agreement will not alter the broad outlines of the May truce, which lowered tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disney and Universal have jointly filed a lawsuit against AI image company Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement for the unlicensed use of characters from movies like Star Wars, The Simpsons, Shrek, and Despicable Me. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney used and distributed AI-generated images of these characters without permission and disregarded requests to stop. The studios included numerous examples of AI-generated images in the suit and are demanding a jury trial, arguing that Midjourney is a "copyright free-rider" whose actions threaten copyright law. Both companies claim they sent letters to Midjourney's counsel to prevent further copyright infringement, but the company continued to release new iterations of its image generator.</p>

This practice allows children to build credit history with each purchase, potentially improving their credit score. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of a good credit score for securing better rates on mortgages, car loans, and even employment opportunities. Parents are advised to pay bills in full and on time to avoid negatively impacting their child's credit score and to monitor for unauthorized purchases.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the UK government's Spending Review, outlining budgets for departments over the next three years, with a focus on public services. England's schools will receive increased funding, particularly for infrastructure, while the NHS will see a 3% annual real-terms increase in spending. Long-term investment in transport infrastructure is also central to the plan, including upgrades to rail lines and bus services.

This move is part of Google's ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since laying off 12,000 employees in 2023. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are mandating office returns for remote workers. The buyouts come as Google aims to drive more cost-cutting while expanding its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A bison gored a 30-year-old man in Yellowstone National Park after he approached too closely, resulting in minor injuries. This incident marks the second such clash in a month, highlighting the dangers of disregarding warnings about approaching wildlife. Park officials emphasize the importance of maintaining a safe distance from large animals like bison, elk, moose, and bears, as bison can be aggressive and unpredictable. Visitors are required to stay at least 25 yards away from most large animals and 100 yards from bears and wolves.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate increased slightly in May, with grocery inflation offsetting lower gasoline prices. Economists anticipate President Trump's tariff policy will increase consumer prices in the coming months. The consumer price index rose 2.4% in the 12 months through May, up from 2.3% in April. While the monthly inflation rate showed a modest increase, economists suggest tariffs will have a more noticeable impact later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>EU and US Grapple with Child Labor Issues</h2>

          <p>Despite progress in reducing child labor globally, challenges persist, particularly in the EU and US, with 138 million children involved in child labor in 2025. Child labor remains a significant issue in agriculture and informal sectors, often hidden within marginalized communities. While the EU has implemented directives to protect young workers, concerns remain regarding supply chains and the enforcement of labor standards. The US has seen an increase in child labor violations, especially in agriculture, where standards are lower.</p>
