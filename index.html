          <p>A fundraising campaign for the funeral of a four-year-old boy, Zaahir Jan, has raised over £5,500. The child was fatally struck by a bus outside a hospital in Margate, Kent, where he had been visiting his grandmother. His father described him as the "cutest, smartest, charmed boy" and expressed profound grief, while his mother launched the GoFundMe appeal to give him a proper burial.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any peace deal that would involve ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. His statement comes in anticipation of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sparking concerns in Kyiv that Ukraine could be sidelined. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that any agreement reached without Ukrainian participation would be a "dead solution" against peace. This reaffirms Ukraine's sovereign stance amid high-stakes international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a notable increase in tourists from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), 72% of Chinese tourists expressed a desire for long-haul travel to the continent, a figure significantly higher than other key markets like the US and Japan. This resurgence in travel is providing a welcome boost to Europe's tourism industry as it enjoys a busy summer season.

          <p>The term "grifter" has become a prevalent insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of profiting from their beliefs through shady or dishonest means. This analysis notes a significant increase in the word's usage, suggesting a deep-seated public suspicion of politicians' motives, fueled by past scandals and the rise of online influencer culture. The article posits that in an "Age of Grift," characterized by online scams and a fascination with con artists, the public is increasingly paranoid and quick to label political figures as disingenuous operators.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has firmly rejected the possibility of U.S. military operations within its territory to combat drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum's statement follows reports that U.S. President Donald Trump had signed a directive authorizing potential military force against these groups on foreign soil. Sheinbaum clarified that while Mexico collaborates with the U.S. on security, a military "invasion" is "absolutely ruled out." This comes after Trump designated several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations, escalating diplomatic tensions over sovereignty and security cooperation.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has ended his attempt to switch to the NFL, a move attributed to a combination of injury, coaching changes at the Jacksonville Jaguars, and new opportunities in rugby.

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil is not expected to derail ongoing EU-India free trade negotiations. Experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and that a greater pressure on India comes from the threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. This American pressure may paradoxically push India to seek a more stable and predictable economic partnership with the EU. The complex geopolitical dynamic highlights the challenges of enforcing sanctions on Russia's war funding without disrupting global trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>
