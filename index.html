          <p>Ireland's public broadcaster, RTÉ, has announced it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to compete, citing the ongoing conflict and loss of life in Gaza. The broadcaster stated that taking part under such circumstances would be unconscionable. Several other national broadcasters, including those from Slovenia, Iceland, and potentially Spain, have expressed similar concerns or intentions to withdraw. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the event, is currently consulting with its members on how to manage geopolitical tensions surrounding the competition, with a final decision on participation expected later this year.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The incident occurred while Kirk was taking questions from a crowd, with a single shot believed to have been fired from a nearby building. Law enforcement has recovered a high-powered rifle and is searching for a suspect described as college-aged, releasing images of a person of interest. The assassination has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from President Trump and former presidents, sparking a national conversation about rising political violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>The FBI is appealing to the public for help in identifying a person of interest in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Authorities have released two images of the individual and confirmed the recovery of a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to be the weapon used in the targeted attack at Utah Valley University. Investigators have tracked the suspect's movements, indicating he arrived on campus, moved to a rooftop to fire the shot, and then fled. The assassination has intensified political discourse, with President Trump blaming rhetoric from the left for the violence.</p>

          <p>New estimates based on August inflation data suggest that millions of Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would increase the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54, a modest rise from the 2.5% boost in 2025 but lower than the record highs seen in recent years. The official announcement is expected in October, but retirees remain concerned that such adjustments may not keep pace with rising costs for essentials like Medicare premiums and other living expenses.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is facing questions regarding the purchase of his £885,000 constituency home in Clacton, which was bought in his partner's name without a mortgage. A BBC investigation challenges Farage's claim that his partner, Laure Ferrari, could afford the property due to her family's wealth, finding little evidence to support this. The arrangement allowed for the avoidance of over £44,000 in second-home stamp duty, opening Farage to accusations of hypocrisy after he recently criticized another politician for similar tax avoidance.

          <p>The Hostages and Missing Family Forum, representing the 48 hostages still held by Hamas, issued a statement of grief following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The forum praised Kirk for his powerful and unwavering support for Israel and the families of the hostages, stating his solidarity was deeply felt. Kirk, 31, was a vocal advocate for the release of individuals abducted during the October 7, 2023 attacks. His death comes at a sensitive time, just after President Trump met with hostage families and following an Israeli strike on Hamas leadership in Qatar that has complicated negotiation efforts.</p>

          <p>A former executive at Verily, Alphabet's health tech subsidiary, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging the company improperly used the health data of over 25,000 patients and concealed the violations. The lawsuit claims Ryan Sloan was fired after he reported multiple breaches of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to senior management. According to the complaint, an internal investigation confirmed breaches of agreements with major clients like Walgreens and Delta Air Lines, but Verily delayed notifying them to avoid negative publicity and secure contract renewals. Verily has stated the allegations are without merit and intends to defend itself fully.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of scientific organizations, allowing the Trump administration to terminate over 1,600 National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants valued at more than $1 billion. The cuts, orchestrated by the administration's "department of government efficiency," have particularly targeted grants aimed at improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM fields. The plaintiffs argued the terminations were unlawful, but the court found it likely lacked jurisdiction and that the groups failed to show irreparable harm.

Known for his fluent debating style and provocative social media presence, Kirk promoted controversial views on race, gender, and climate change, alongside conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose by 2.9% in August compared to a year earlier, marking the fastest pace of inflation since January. Economists attribute the acceleration primarily to rising prices for consumer goods and groceries, with President Trump's tariff policies cited as a significant contributing factor for items like apparel and household furnishings. Prices for services have also remained elevated, particularly for electricity and travel, offering little counterbalance to the rising cost of goods. This trend is expected to continue, presenting a challenge for the Federal Reserve as it considers interest rate cuts to support a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

This article reflects on Kirk's personal practice of observing the Jewish Sabbath, an act of stepping away from the relentless pace of modern political conflict. It draws a parallel to the Jewish mourning ritual of shiva, which creates a structured space to process loss and hold complex, often contradictory, feelings about the deceased.

          <p>NATO members are deploying additional troops and air defense systems to the alliance's eastern flank after several Russian drones were shot down over Poland in an unprecedented incursion. The Netherlands and the Czech Republic are sending forces and equipment to Poland, while Germany will enhance air policing over the region. The incident, which Polish and other European leaders believe was a deliberate provocation, has prompted Poland to request a UN Security Council session. The incursion has heightened anxiety in Eastern Europe, occurring just as Russia and Belarus are set to begin major joint military exercises.</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as ambassador to the United States following the release of new documents detailing his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The documents included an email in which Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal" and suggested his first conviction was wrongful. The British Foreign Office stated that this new information revealed a relationship materially different from what was known at the time of his appointment. The dismissal comes at a sensitive time, just before a state visit from U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>A French parliamentary commission has recommended banning children under 15 from social media and implementing an overnight "digital curfew" for older teens, following a six-month inquiry into TikTok's psychological effects.

The inquiry was initiated after families alleged the platform's content contributed to youth suicides.

          <p>Chelsea FC has been charged by the Football Association with 74 alleged rule breaches concerning payments to agents between 2009 and 2022, a period when the club was owned by Roman Abramovich. The charges, which focus on transfers involving players like Eden Hazard and Willian, relate to rules on agents, intermediaries, and third-party investments. The club's new ownership group discovered the potential breaches during their due diligence process and self-reported the issues to regulators. While sanctions could include fines or a transfer ban, Chelsea's cooperation is expected to be a mitigating factor.</p>

          <p>Medicare's "3-day rule" is a critical regulation that can significantly affect out-of-pocket costs for seniors requiring post-hospital care. The rule mandates that a beneficiary must have a medically necessary inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days for Medicare Part A to cover subsequent care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Time spent in the hospital under "observation status" does not count toward this requirement, a distinction that can leave patients with unexpected, substantial bills.
