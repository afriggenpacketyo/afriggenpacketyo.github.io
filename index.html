          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, with some already on planes prepared for takeoff. The judge's 14-day order ensures these vulnerable minors receive legal protections and due process, which their attorneys argued were being circumvented by a rushed process. Lawyers expressed serious concerns that the children could face abuse, neglect, or persecution if returned without proper legal review. This ruling underscores the intense legal and humanitarian debate surrounding U.S. immigration enforcement and the welfare of migrant children at the border, highlighting a significant challenge to the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration undertook a significant redecoration of the Oval Office, incorporating extensive gold accents on trim, door frames, and even sculpted cherubim, a style he termed "Trump touches." This lavish "goldening," reportedly paid for personally by Trump, has elicited strong reactions, with some praising it as a symbol of a new American era while others criticized it as "vulgar" or "gaudy." The article places these changes within a historical tradition of presidents customizing the office, though noting the unprecedented scale of Trump's aesthetic transformation. This reflects a president's personal style impacting a highly symbolic national space.</p>

          <p>An aid flotilla, carrying Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and other activists, has set sail from Barcelona bound for Gaza. The mission, involving at least 20 vessels transporting humanitarian aid, aims to establish a humanitarian corridor and protest what organizers describe as an "ongoing genocide." This marks Thunberg's second attempt to reach Gaza after a previous deportation. The journey highlights severe international concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where a famine was recently confirmed, despite Israel's rejection of the report. The Spanish government has pledged diplomatic protection for its citizens on board.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared Washington D.C. a "crime-free zone" on Truth Social, attributing the achievement to his federal crackdown initiated two weeks prior. This operation involved declaring a public safety emergency, placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, and deploying hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents. According to preliminary data cited in the article, these efforts have resulted in a 40% drop in robberies and auto break-ins, alongside over 700 arrests and the seizure of 91 illegal firearms. The administration frames this as a significant success in restoring public order.</p>
