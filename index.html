          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as Shane D. Tamura, reportedly left a note blaming a head injury on the NFL, whose offices are located in the building. He drove across the country from Las Vegas and had a documented mental health history. The attack has been condemned by officials as a senseless act of violence, prompting calls for stricter national gun control laws.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to revoke the 2009 "Endangerment Finding," a key EPA determination that classifies greenhouse gases as harmful pollutants. This move would severely limit the federal government's ability to regulate carbon emissions from sources like power plants and vehicles to combat climate change. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the decision as a major deregulatory action to boost economic prosperity, while critics warn of devastating environmental consequences and expect legal challenges.

          <p>A new trade deal announced by the Trump administration imposes a 15% tariff on most E.U. imports while eliminating tariffs on U.S. exports to the bloc. The agreement also includes a pledge for the E.U. to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion by 2028. While the White House claims the deal will boost U.S. manufacturing, some economists argue it is an unbalanced pact that will raise consumer prices and reduce the E.U.'s GDP.

          <p>Just 11 days after her mother and younger sister were killed in a plane crash near Washington, D.C., 14-year-old pianist Anne Valerie "A.V." Ter won a major piano competition. She performed a piece that her mother had particularly loved and dreamed of her playing with an orchestra. Despite the immense grief, Ter found solace in her music and delivered what she called her best-ever performance, fulfilling her mother's wish and finding a moment of normalcy for her grieving family.</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that Britain will recognize Palestine as a state at the U.N. in September unless Israel takes significant steps toward a ceasefire in Gaza. This move, which follows a similar announcement from France, is intended to protect the viability of a two-state solution, which the U.K. government says is in peril. The Israeli government condemned the decision, calling it a "reward for Hamas" that undermines efforts to secure a hostage release.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has formally proposed a plan to revoke its authority to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicle emissions, a move that would dismantle strict tailpipe standards. This follows the administration's successful efforts to revoke California's ability to set its own tougher emissions rules and to remove fines for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards. The proposal is a victory for the oil industry but is expected to face significant legal challenges from environmental groups who warn of increased pollution and long-term costs for drivers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are skeptical about the feasibility of the energy component of the new U.S.-E.U. trade deal, which includes a non-binding pledge for the E.U. to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy by 2028. The European Commission cannot force member states or private companies to buy U.S. energy, and significant market and logistical constraints exist for tripling current purchase levels of oil and LNG. This sets up a potential future conflict if the ambitious targets are not met, as the White House has reserved the right to adjust tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear a critical case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, that challenges the president's legal authority to impose broad tariffs without congressional approval. The lawsuit, brought by small businesses and 12 states, argues that President Trump improperly used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the levies. A ruling against the administration could significantly curtail the president's ability to unilaterally set trade policy and impact ongoing negotiations with other countries.</p>
