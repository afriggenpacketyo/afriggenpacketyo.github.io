          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline is a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the Salton Sea's exposed shoreline accounts for less than 1% of the small particle pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. Researchers suggest that the numerous other pollution sources, like agriculture and diesel exhaust, mean that focusing on indoor air filtration may be more effective for public health. This challenges the long-held belief that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the area's severe respiratory health issues.</p>
