          <p>Wall Street experienced a significant downturn after President Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on critical software, set to begin November 1. This intensified trade threat caused the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to suffer their worst single-session declines since April. Meanwhile, Nvidia had a volatile week, facing competition from AMD and concerns over cloud margins, though CEO Jensen Huang expressed confidence in long-term profitability and U.S. AI dominance.

          <p>Scottish National Party members have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, based on the precedent set for the 2014 referendum. Despite a proposal for a de-facto referendum based on pro-independence votes, Swinney emphasized his commitment to delivering independence for Scotland through a clear electoral victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand items, driven by growing awareness of its massive carbon footprint and environmental impact. Fast furniture, characterized by cheap, mass-produced decor designed for short lifecycles, contributes significantly to landfill waste due to its unrecyclable materials and rapid style changes. This generation's preference for reuse and the emotional connection formed with refurbished pieces offers a clear antidote to the industry's environmental toll, fostering a more sustainable approach to home decor.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress and the President fail to agree on budget funds, halting non-essential government operations based on the Antideficiency Act. This current shutdown, the 21st since 1976, has led to an estimated 750,000 federal employees being furloughed and impacted public services like national parks. While military and critical functions continue, the dispute over healthcare policy, particularly Obamacare and Medicaid, leaves the duration uncertain, with potential for permanent layoffs and financial hardship for workers.</p>
