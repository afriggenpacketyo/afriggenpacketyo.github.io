          <p>The Russell 2000, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, has officially entered a bear market, falling over 20% from its November high. This downturn follows a broader market sell-off triggered by President Trump's aggressive tariff policies.  The small-cap sector's sensitivity to economic shifts and increased debt servicing costs contribute to its vulnerability.  Analysts predict further declines, raising concerns about a potential recession, highlighting the economic impact of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Ed Martin, faces intense scrutiny for his past legal work defending January 6th Capitol riot defendants.  His Senate questionnaire highlights these cases, while Democrats raise concerns about his potential bias and undermining of the office's independence.  Martin's past advocacy against Joe Biden's election win and his firing of prosecutors involved in January 6th cases further fuel opposition to his nomination.  The position's significance in prosecuting cases involving Congress and federal agencies adds weight to the controversy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's newly revealed tariff formula aims to address the U.S. trade deficit by raising prices of imported goods to reduce demand.  The formula suggests a direct correlation between the trade deficit with a country and the tariff rate imposed.  However, the formula's assumptions regarding price increases and demand elasticity are subject to debate among economists.  The analysis highlights the administration's explicit acknowledgment of tariffs' impact on prices, a departure from previous statements, and raises concerns about the accuracy and potential economic consequences of its calculations.
