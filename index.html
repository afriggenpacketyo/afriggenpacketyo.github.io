          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, achieved a resounding victory in the recent general election, securing 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats and increasing its vote share to 65.57%. This election marked Wong's first as prime minister, with key issues including cost of living, job prospects, and economic growth dominating the campaign. Wong emphasized that the results signal trust, stability, and confidence in the government, particularly important given the current turbulent global landscape and slowing economic growth, as the country navigates the immediate uncertainties arising from U.S. tariffs and related global developments. The U.S. State Department and European Commission have already congratulated Wong on the PAP's victory, expressing eagerness to collaborate with the new government.</p>

Designer Steven Stolman, who assisted Kentucky's first lady with her Derby outfit, emphasized the importance of a hat complementing the wearer, rather than overshadowing them. While the weather complicated matters, the crowd of over 147,000 attendees embraced the tradition of wearing hats, displaying a wide range of styles from understated elegance to extreme creativity. Some attendees had to make adjustments to their outfits and hats due to the weather, but the party atmosphere managed to come through.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Democratic Party seeks to regain support, an uncomfortable question has arisen in California: are their leaders simply too old? Some party activists are advocating for a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders, spurred by concerns over leaders remaining in power past their prime, reminiscent of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein's tenure. While the proposal faces opposition, it reflects broader anxieties about age and leadership, particularly following President Biden's perceived decline. The debate highlights a tension between valuing experience and creating opportunities for younger candidates, a sentiment echoed nationally by activists advocating for generational change in politics.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's recent election victory as Prime Minister of Canada was significantly influenced by his stance against Donald Trump's trade policies and perceived threats to Canadian sovereignty. He emphasized the need to stand up to Trump's "betrayal" and protect Canada's economy, exemplified by rallies near the US-Canada border. His strategy resonated with voters, including those from Quebec separatists, who prioritized Canada's independence from the US. Carney's approach combines crisis economics with public oration, promising to govern with econometrics and defend Canada's interests against external threats.</p>

This decision contrasts with an earlier ruling that would have allowed VoA to resume broadcasting while the appeal played out, but it maintains the freeze on funding for other publicly funded broadcasters, impacting their staffing and content.</p>

          <p>As Europe commemorates VE Day, concerns are growing about the impact of President Trump on transatlantic relations, with some viewing him as a threat to shared values and security. While Russia's role in World War II is acknowledged, Trump's apparent respect for Putin and his questioning of NATO commitments have alarmed European leaders. The war in Ukraine has heightened these anxieties, as Europeans fear Trump's attitude may embolden Putin and leave them vulnerable. Many Europeans now view the White House as a threat to peace and security, prompting increased defense spending and a reevaluation of reliance on the U.S.</p>

Reform's success is concentrated in areas characterized as 'left-behind' Britain, where globalization and university expansion have had less impact, and conservative views on immigration are more prevalent, presenting a challenge for both Conservative and Labour parties.</p>
