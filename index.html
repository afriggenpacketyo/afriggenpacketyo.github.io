          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark, New Jersey. According to the article, Alina Habba, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, stated that Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials to leave the facility. The arrest occurred during a protest at the facility, where at least three U.S. House Democrats from New Jersey were also present. Baraka's administration had previously filed a lawsuit to block the opening of the detention center, arguing that it lacked proper permits.</p>

Edelman emphasizes the need to plan for a lifespan of 100 years or more, citing advancements in health technology.

The article explains that the long-awaited resentencing hearing will take place over two days, on May 13 and 14. The brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1996, and their case has remained a subject of public interest. The new district attorney opposes resentencing, citing a lack of "full insight" into their crimes.</p>
