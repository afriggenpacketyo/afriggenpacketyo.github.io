          <p>Two Republican senators on the Banking Committee have stated they will not consider a replacement for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook until her lawsuit against President Trump is resolved. Trump recently attempted to fire Cook, a move she is challenging in court. The senators' stance is significant as their support is crucial for confirming any new nominee, creating a potential stalemate and highlighting the political tensions surrounding the independence of the central bank. This development leaves Cook's position in limbo pending a final court decision on the matter.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended a recent military strike against a Venezuelan drug cartel vessel, stating the U.S. will no longer "sit back" and tolerate narco-terrorism. The strike, which reportedly killed 11 members of the Tren de Aragua gang, represents a significant shift from the previous policy of seizing vessels and apprehending suspects. Rubio emphasized that these organizations pose a direct national security threat by trafficking drugs, arms, and people. He confirmed this aggressive new strategy will continue to be employed against such groups in the region.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares declined by 4% in extended trading despite the company reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst estimates. The stock's drop was attributed to a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, which fell short of Wall Street's expectations. While Salesforce raised its full-year earnings outlook, its revenue growth has remained in the single digits for over a year. The guidance suggests the company continues to face challenges in translating its AI investments into significant financial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced plans to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates, a move that would make Florida the first state in the nation to do so. The policy would eliminate long-standing requirements for vaccines against diseases like measles and polio for school attendance. The announcement drew immediate criticism from medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned that it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases and endanger public health. The state will also create a new commission to promote "medical freedom."</p>

          <p>Following a major military parade in China, U.S. President Donald Trump described the display as "very, very impressive" but expressed concern that the United States was not credited for its role in helping China gain its freedom. In remarks from the Oval Office, Trump stated that he believed the U.S. should have been mentioned during President Xi's speech. Earlier, Trump had posted on social media congratulating Xi while also accusing him of conspiring with Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un against the United States, reflecting a complex diplomatic stance.</p>

          <p>Stage 11 of the Vuelta a Espana cycling race was abruptly ended three kilometers from the finish line due to disruptions caused by pro-Palestinian protesters. Race organizers made the decision to neutralize the finish, meaning no stage winner was declared, to ensure rider safety. This incident follows several other protests targeting the race, including one that caused a crash in a previous stage. Riders and cycling's governing body, the UCI, expressed frustration and condemned the actions, stating that endangering athletes is not a constructive way to advance a political cause.</p>

          <p>The remains of Seaman 2nd Class Jerome M. Mullaney, an 18-year-old sailor killed during World War II, have been officially identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Mullaney died in June 1944 when his ship, the USS Glennon, struck a mine off the coast of France shortly after D-Day and was subsequently shelled by German artillery. His remains were recovered from the wreckage in 1957 but could not be identified at the time. Using modern DNA analysis, scientists finally confirmed his identity, allowing for his burial in his hometown.</p>

          <p>A new survey from PwC predicts that American consumers will reduce their holiday spending by an average of 5%, the most significant drop since 2020. The report suggests that persistent inflation and economic uncertainty are causing shoppers to be more deliberate with their budgets. Gen Z is expected to cut back the most, with a projected 23% reduction in their holiday spending. This anticipated pullback could pose a challenge for retailers, who rely heavily on the November and December shopping season for a substantial portion of their annual revenue.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court ruled that the current situation at the border does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the legal standard required to invoke the wartime law. The decision is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure statute to bypass standard immigration proceedings. The ACLU hailed the ruling as an important check on executive power.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is reportedly being considered for a position in the Trump administration as part of a plan to persuade him to drop his reelection campaign. The strategy is believed to be an effort by Republicans and centrist Democrats to consolidate opposition against the progressive Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani, potentially clearing the path for independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. While Adams did not definitively deny the discussions, his campaign issued a statement insisting he is not dropping out, adding another layer of intrigue to the city's mayoral election.</p>

          <p>A major illegal sports streaming platform known as Streameast has been shut down following a coordinated global raid involving law enforcement from the U.S. and Europe. The network, which had accumulated 1.6 billion views in the last year, was a major source of pirated content for events like UFC pay-per-views. The raid, conducted in Egypt, resulted in two arrests and the seizure of assets, uncovering evidence of a broader money-laundering operation.
