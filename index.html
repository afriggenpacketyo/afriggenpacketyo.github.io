          <p>Police in Somerset are reviewing footage of performances by rap groups Bob Vylan and Kneecap at the Glastonbury Festival. The review follows controversial on-stage comments, including chants from Bob Vylan calling for the death of the Israeli military, which were broadcast live by the BBC. The government strongly condemned the remarks, prompting the BBC to issue an on-air warning and remove the performance from its on-demand iPlayer service. Authorities will now assess the footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed during the sets.</p>

          <p>Medical researchers and cancer patients are raising alarms over layoffs and budget cuts at the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute, which they say have been pushed by the Trump administration. Scientists argue that these financial reductions are jeopardizing critical research and imperiling clinical trials for new treatments and vaccines, turning a once bipartisan issue into a political battle. Patients involved in these trials express concern that the cuts threaten their own contributions to finding a cure and could halt progress on life-saving medical advancements.</p>

During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his MLB career at 101.7 mph but was unable to contribute offensively, going hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts. Despite his strong performance on the mound, the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss.

          <p>Civil servants across China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent and constantly changing local austerity campaigns that can be stricter than central government regulations. This shift in lifestyle is a result of what is known in Mandarin as "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control, as local department heads impose their own bans to ensure compliance. An official in Sichuan province noted that their superior announced a dine-out ban in May, reflecting a broader trend of cautious behavior among government employees to avoid scrutiny under the intensified anti-corruption and austerity drives.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major domestic policy and spending package cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate, advancing after a dramatic late-night vote. The motion passed 51-49 after several Republican holdouts eventually voted in favor, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The contentious 940-page bill now moves to a final vote, which is expected early next week. However, its passage remains uncertain as it must also be approved again by the House, where some Republicans have already voiced opposition to the Senate's version.</p>

          <p>A wildfire, dubbed the Lake fire, has rapidly grown to 478 acres in San Bernardino County, forcing evacuations and road closures near the Silverwood Lake State Recreation Area. The blaze, which is currently 0% contained, broke out late Saturday afternoon and forced over 100 people at the reservoir to flee, with some evacuated by boaters. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for areas south of Highway 138. Firefighters are battling the flames from the ground and air, with officials warning that stronger wind gusts forecasted for Monday could pose additional challenges to suppression efforts.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Samuel Woodward guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who was involved with the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, targeted Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The verdict, which came after a nearly three-month trial, means Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Bernstein's family expressed relief at the verdict, stating it holds Woodward accountable for the brutal and violent murder of their son.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's decision to halt rare earth exports is accelerating efforts to establish alternative production capabilities in other countries, though the process is expected to be costly and challenging. American firm REalloys announced plans for a US$50 million facility to produce high-performance magnet materials, sourcing ore from Brazil and processing it in Canada. Analysts suggest that building a non-Chinese supply chain will be a protracted endeavor due to technical hurdles. It may also require government subsidies and tariffs to compete with China's long-standing dominance in the global rare earths market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, slowly releasing it as heat, which raises air temperatures, especially at night. The lack of vegetation and water, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the effect. As climate change leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves, urban populations are particularly vulnerable to the dangerous impacts of extreme heat and associated air pollution.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong habits and empower the next generation to protect themselves from harmful UV exposure.</p>
