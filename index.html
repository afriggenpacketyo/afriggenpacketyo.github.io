          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to be sworn in as Germany's Chancellor, leading a coalition government facing significant challenges including economic slump, strained international relations, and the rise of the far-right AfD. Merz has tapped several individuals from the private sector for cabinet positions, a rare move in German politics, including Karsten Wildberger as digitization minister and Katherina Reiche as Economy Minister. Despite these unorthodox choices, analysts believe the parties are trying to deliver on promises of political change, balancing new faces with loyalty to party leaders, in this article.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has become the Chancellor of Germany at a critical juncture, facing economic stagnation, strained relationships with the United States, and the rise of a nationalist party. Despite lacking executive government experience, Merz has taken aggressive steps to address these challenges, including criticizing President Trump and relaxing fiscal restraints to invest in national defense. His supporters view him as an agile politician capable of delivering on key issues, while critics point to his broken promises and fluctuating popularity, with his decisions alienating conservative voters and causing his party to sag in the polls. This article highlights Merz's background, political career, and the complex challenges he faces as Germany's new leader.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a cornerstone of the nation's economy, faces potential disruption due to proposed U.S. tariffs. While President Trump paused the tariffs, the possibility of reinstatement worries the millions of workers dependent on the industry. The garment sector has transformed since the Rana Plaza collapse, improving working conditions and consolidating operations, yet a 10 percent tariff could still impact the low-margin business. This article examines the potential economic consequences and the resilience of Bangladesh's garment factories, highlighting the reliance of the country on its labor force.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to end a tariff loophole has disrupted the flow of inexpensive goods from China to the U.S., potentially affecting delivery companies like UPS and FedEx, and Chinese e-commerce businesses. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, is now gone, leading to potential tariffs of up to 145 percent on Chinese goods. While some companies anticipate a decline in revenue, others are adapting by shifting to locally based sellers and fulfilling orders within the U.S., as this article states.</p>

          <p>The UK government is investing £102m to upgrade and expand over 1,000 GP surgeries, aiming to tackle long waiting times and improve patient services. This investment, the largest in facilities for five years, is intended to create additional space for doctors to see more patients and address the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments. The initiative comes as patient satisfaction with NHS GP services has significantly declined, driven by fewer in-person appointments, with the hope that improved facilities will shift care from hospitals to the community, as described in the article.</p>
