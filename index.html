        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. This assessment contrasts with claims from the Trump administration that the program was "obliterated." Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the technological knowledge and industrial capacity to restart its activities, highlighting the need for inspectors to regain access to the sites. The situation remains uncertain, with questions lingering about whether Iran moved its enriched uranium before the strikes occurred.</p>

          <p>The UK's public inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic has begun examining its devastating impact on the social care sector, particularly in care homes. Bereaved families and care staff are seeking answers to key questions, such as the controversial decision in early 2020 to discharge hospital patients into care homes without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus. The inquiry will also investigate issues like "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies. This phase is a critical moment for accountability, with nearly 46,000 care home residents having died with Covid in England and Wales.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were fatally shot after being ambushed while responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office described the incident as an active shooter situation, with law enforcement taking sniper fire from one or more suspects in the mountainous terrain. Authorities are investigating whether the fire was deliberately set to lure first responders to the scene, a possibility that adds a sinister layer to the attack.

          <p>Police in Istanbul detained more than 50 people who attempted to participate in an LGBTQ+ Pride march, which authorities had banned for the ninth consecutive year. The city's governor cited risks to "social peace, family structure, and moral values" as the reason for the ban. Despite a heavy police presence, activists gathered with rainbow flags before being dispersed by officers. The event highlights the increasingly hostile environment for the LGBTQ+ community in Turkey, where President Erdogan's government has intensified its harsh rhetoric and policies against them, even as homosexuality itself is not a crime.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that followed his opposition to President Trump's major spending and tax bill. Hours before his announcement, Trump had criticized Tillis on social media and threatened to support a primary challenger against him for not backing the legislation. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, suggesting that independent thinking is increasingly punished within political parties. His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a traditionally Republican state.</p>

Her boss, former chief prosecutor Kentaro Kitagawa, has been indicted but recently changed his plea from guilty to not guilty, claiming the encounter was consensual.

This article explores the national obsession, following dedicated seekers who spend significant time and money using trail cams and searching for evidence in the Tasmanian bush. The story also delves into a high-tech "de-extinction" project backed by millions in funding, which aims to bring the creature back by editing the DNA of its closest living relative. The enduring hope reflects a mix of folklore, passion, and perhaps remorse for the predator's original extinction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has raised concerns about the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), warning that its structure could cause some savers to withdraw less money than they initially invested. LISAs offer a 25% government bonus on savings for a first home or retirement, but early withdrawals for other reasons incur a penalty that erodes the original capital. The Treasury Committee report described the product as "complex" and potentially "inferior" for individuals who might be eligible for benefits, as LISA savings can affect their eligibility, unlike traditional pensions. The committee is calling for reforms to the program. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump stated his administration could soon issue letters to Japan and other trading partners unilaterally informing them of tariff rates, suggesting a 25% tariff on cars as a possibility. He reiterated his view that the trade relationship is unfair, citing the large number of Japanese cars sold in the U.S. compared to American cars sold in Japan. These comments come as a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs approaches its expiration. (not investment advice)</p>

This article details concerns from former and current employees, such as the late John Barnett, who claimed that pressure to speed up production led to substandard parts being used and safety procedures being ignored. While Boeing insists the aircraft is safe, the claims involve issues like missing parts, defective wiring, and improper fuselage joints.

On the court, however, Sky rookie Angel Reese dominated with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle.

The CBO also estimated that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill passes.

          <p>Chinese authorities are conducting a widespread crackdown on authors of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction, with dozens of young female writers reportedly arrested since February. The writers, who publish on a Taiwan-based platform called Haitang, are accused of producing and distributing obscene material, a crime that can carry a lengthy prison sentence. The crackdown has sparked a debate on social media about China's restrictive pornography laws, which are seen as disproportionately targeting queer content. The arrests have outed the writers, who often work anonymously, leading to social shame in addition to legal peril.</p>

The official focus also appeared to shift from facility destruction to achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

While the blanket ban is lifted, restrictions on food from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, will remain in place.
