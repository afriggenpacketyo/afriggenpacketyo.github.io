          <p>Authorities have increased the reward to $50,000 for information leading to the arrest of Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves, two inmates who remain at large after escaping from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16th. Eight of the ten escapees have been apprehended, but Massey and Groves are still on the run, prompting law enforcement to seek public assistance. Police Superintendent Col Robert Hodges stated that they have strong leads, but tips are still needed due to the fugitives' movement, and he warned that anyone aiding the fugitives will be prosecuted. Crimestoppers of Greater New Orleans has received nearly 700 tips related to the escape, leading to the arrest of three inmates.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old man from Liverpool has been charged with intentionally causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving after allegedly ramming a car into crowds celebrating Liverpool's Premier League title victory.

          <p>The Trump administration has claimed that former First Lady Jill Biden is complicit in a cover-up regarding former President Joe Biden's alleged mental decline. Meanwhile, President Trump's global tariff policy has encountered a setback as a federal court ruled he lacks the authority to unilaterally impose certain levies. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, arguing it could lead to a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and undermine the president's leverage in trade negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the administration will work to "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities as the dispute with Harvard continues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to take its tariffs case to the Supreme Court, unless a recent order that struck down many of President Donald Trump's new import taxes is put on hold. This action follows a second court ruling that Trump had overstepped his power in imposing the tariffs, which has sparked concerns from Trump officials. The White House asserts that the decisions represent judicial overreach and threaten sensitive trade negotiations. Challenges to the tariffs center on the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with critics arguing it does not grant the president such broad authority over trade policy.</p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate student, Fangzhou Jiang, expressed concerns about the uncertain atmosphere on campus as the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to restrict international students. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement gave the school 30 days to challenge the administration's revocation of certification to enroll international students. Tensions escalated further with the announcement that officials would begin to "aggressively revoke" the visas of some Chinese students.</p>

          <p>Synopsys has withdrawn its full-year guidance, citing a letter from the U.S. Commerce Department regarding restrictions on sales of its products in China, causing the stock to drop.

Synopsys reported a slowdown in China during its fiscal second quarter, with approximately 10% of its quarterly revenue coming from Chinese customers.

          <p>Twenty-two young Americans have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that its anti-environment executive orders violate their constitutional rights to life and liberty. The lawsuit contends that the administration's promotion of oil and gas production and suppression of carbon-free energy breaches congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health. Plaintiffs argue that these actions have violated the state-created danger doctrine, which is meant to prevent government actors from inflicting injury upon their citizens. The lawsuit specifically targets three pro-fossil fuel executive orders signed by Trump.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that even if global temperatures stabilize at current levels, many of the world's glaciers are destined to shrink significantly over the next few centuries. The research indicates that glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose roughly one-third of their mass, contributing to sea level rise and increasing the risk of floods and landslides. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels could save approximately twice as much ice compared to a 2.7-degree Celsius warming scenario. Scientists emphasize that every tenth of a degree less of warming will help preserve glacial ice.</p>

          <p>In France, survivors and family members are seeking change following the trial of a doctor sentenced to 20 years in prison for assaulting nearly 300 patients, mostly children. The case has raised questions about institutional failures and the need for better protection for children. Advocacy groups are calling for legislative reform to impose tougher sentences for serial rapists, as the current maximum sentence for aggravated sexual assault is limited to 20 years. Survivors express disappointment with the limited attention the case has received compared to other sexual assault trials.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve issued a rare statement asserting its independence after Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump, emphasizing its nonpartisan role in setting monetary policy based on economic data. Powell assured Trump that the Fed will make decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis to support maximum employment and stable prices. This statement follows Trump's public pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, despite concerns about economic instability caused by Trump's trade war. The Fed's firm stance highlights its commitment to maintaining independence from political influence.</p>
