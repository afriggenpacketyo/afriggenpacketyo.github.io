          <h2>International Community Concerned Over Alleged War Crimes in Gaza</h2>

          <p>The BBC reports that Israel is facing accusations of war crimes in Gaza, prompting scrutiny from international bodies and governments. Despite the Geneva Conventions mandating the humane treatment and protection of civilians during conflict, there is mounting evidence suggesting violations by Israel. The article highlights challenges in obtaining accurate information from Gaza due to restricted access for international journalists, and quotes lawyers who believe that Israel followed war crimes, committed by Hamas when it attacked Israel, with very many of its own, including the crime of genocide. The piece emphasizes the growing international concern over Israel's actions, with potential legal and political ramifications for the country and its leaders. The situation has caused alarm among humanitarian organizations and Western diplomats, who fear complicity in future criminal investigations if they remain silent about the situation in Gaza. Optimism remains low given the ongoing conflict and alleged violations of international law.</p>

          <p>Following citywide ICE operations and numerous arrests, protests have erupted across Los Angeles, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. In response, President Trump has invoked Title 10 Authority to deploy at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory and an erosion of public trust. The protests initially centered around federal buildings and locations where ICE officers were conducting operations, with demonstrators alleging that detainees were being held unlawfully. Amidst the unrest, a senior union official was arrested, further escalating tensions between immigration advocates and federal authorities. The situation remains volatile as local officials work with federal authorities to navigate the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump is utilizing a rarely invoked power to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests. This decision bypasses the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has criticized the move as inflammatory. The deployment is authorized under Title 10, which allows for the activation of National Guard troops for federal service. Critics, including constitutional law scholars, argue that using the military to suppress dissent is a chilling development and raises concerns about the administration's response to protests. The action follows a series of immigration raids and escalating tensions between protesters and federal agents in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, successfully restoring sight and granting "super vision" to blind animals. The device, composed of tellurium nanowire implants, enabled genetically blind mice and a monkey to see visible and infrared light. Tellurium's excellent photoelectric properties allow it to convert light into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement presents a promising avenue for treating human blindness, offering the potential to restore sight and enhance visual capabilities. The study highlights China's growing role in scientific innovation and the potential of rare minerals in medical applications.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority has sparked legal debate and criticism. Constitutional law scholars argue that using the military domestically to quell protests is a concerning overreach of federal power. Title 10 allows for the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but its use in this context is considered rare and has raised concerns about the suppression of dissent. Critics have also warned against invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which could further escalate the situation and undermine local law enforcement authority. The ACLU has cautioned against the misuse of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing demographic challenges. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China's rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system highlight the urgency of addressing declining fertility rates. The study also reveals that traditional expectations placing the burden of childcare on women persist in China and other East Asian countries, conflicting with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its original emoji set after 26 years, marking the end of an era for the visual language of digital communications. The company's Android smartphones and feature phones will no longer include the Docomo emoji set, with Google's emoji becoming the standard. Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji became widely popular in Japan and later gained global recognition. The set of 176 emoji was even included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

          <p>Recent studies have challenged earlier findings suggesting the presence of biosignatures on the distant planet K2-18b. While initial observations hinted at the existence of molecules produced only by living things, new research indicates that these compounds could also form without life. Astronomers have raised concerns about the quality of data and modeling used in the original study, leading to conflicting results. The debate highlights the complexities of searching for extraterrestrial life and the high burden of proof required to confirm such discoveries. Further observations and research are needed to determine whether K2-18b truly harbors signs of biological activity.</p>

By treating AI as children, people may be more inclined to become better role models and guide AI's development in a positive direction. De Kai's perspective shifts the focus from a US-China technological race to a global challenge of shaping AI's ethical and societal impact.</p>
