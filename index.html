          <p>The White House criticized Amazon following a report that it planned to display tariff costs on product listings, calling it a hostile and political act. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt referenced a previous report about Amazon's partnership with a Chinese propaganda arm, suggesting Americans should buy American. Amazon denied the plan, stating it was never approved and would not happen. The White House's response underscores the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and the e-commerce giant, despite Amazon's efforts to establish a working relationship with the president.

Carney emphasized that he would only visit Washington when there is a serious discussion to be had, rejecting the idea of Canada becoming the "51st state" of America, which Trump has repeatedly mentioned. While open to a mutually beneficial deal with the US, Carney stressed the importance of diversifying trading relationships with the European Union and the UK.

Golf course staff noticed the bear in a tree and contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife and Fisheries division, which advised that the bear was not a danger. The golf course closed the holes to give the bear space, and staff expected it to move along on its own. The bear was last seen napping in the woods on April 28, and it is presumed to have left the property.</p>

          <p>Introverts often communicate more effectively due to their tendency to listen and speak with precision, according to workplace psychology expert. Their brains perform best when forced to confront discomfort, leading them to think more deeply and choose their words carefully. Introverts are more likely to admit what they don't know, value others' perspectives, and ensure thoroughness before making assumptions. They also help defuse tensions by tuning into what people aren't saying, fostering clarity and accelerating progress in decision-making.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by economic uncertainty due to tariffs and executive orders, leading to market instability and concerns about a potential recession. Despite promises of a "golden age" of prosperity, Trump's policies have created confusion among businesses and consumers, particularly due to high tariffs on imported goods. The administration's protectionist policies and strained ties with allies have undermined confidence in the US as a stabilizing economic force. Critics argue that Trump's unpredictable approach is inflicting significant economic, social, and diplomatic damage.</p>

UPS chose to reduce package volume from Amazon to focus on revenue quality and increase domestic operating margin and profitability.
