        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate a sharp fall in UK retail sales last month, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), sales volumes dropped by 2.7% in May, marking the largest monthly decline since December 2023. The ONS noted indications of reduced alcohol and tobacco sales as consumers opted for cutbacks amidst rising costs of living. Separate data from the ONS revealed an increase in government borrowing, reaching the second-highest level for May since records began in 1993, with borrowing at £17.7bn, up £0.7bn from May of the previous year. The article highlights the impact of inflation-linked uplifts to benefits on government spending.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed disappointment with the Ninth Circuit Court's decision to allow President Trump to maintain control of the California National Guard, but emphasized a portion of the ruling as a victory. Newsom stated that the court rejected Trump's claim of unchecked authority over the National Guard and affirmed that the President is not above the law. The court's ruling prevented Trump from federalizing the California National Guard at will and avoiding judicial scrutiny, which Newsom's office hailed as a crucial check on presidential overreach. Despite this, the conflict continues as Trump retains control of the National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to manage riots during demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

While officially recognizing six children with three different partners, Durov has fathered over 100 children through sperm donations to a fertility clinic. The article also mentions that Durov's children will not have access to their inheritance for 30 years, as he wishes them to live like normal people and build their own lives independently.

          <p>China's coastguard employed a water cannon to expel a Philippine government vessel from the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, marking the latest confrontation between Beijing and Manila. According to a Chinese Coast Guard spokesman, the Philippine vessel ignored repeated warnings and intruded into Chinese waters near the strategic shoal. In response, the China Coast Guard implemented standard enforcement measures, including verbal warnings, close monitoring, and water cannons. The confrontation occurred a day after China accused the Philippines of illegally operating in waters near the disputed Half Moon and Royal Captain shoals, further escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>A family from Bolton experienced a traumatic holiday in Cancun, Mexico, after a shootout occurred at their hotel, the Riu Palace Costa Mujeres. Colin Nulty, his wife, and his 14-year-old daughter were relaxing by the pool when gunfire erupted nearby, forcing them to take cover. One man was killed in the shooting, which was reportedly a confrontation between a cartel and undercover police. The family was transferred to another hotel, but encountered news of another shooting en route, leading them to return to the Riu Palace. The article details the family's distress and their attempts to seek compensation from the holiday firm TUI.</p>

          <p>Brazilian women who have experienced sexual assault face significant obstacles in accessing legal abortions, despite the procedure being permitted in cases of sexual assault, life-threatening risks to the pregnant woman, or if the fetus has no functioning brain. A 27-year-old woman in Brasilia was denied access to a legal abortion and resorted to a home abortion with medication purchased on the black market. Advocates and experts cite factors such as lack of facilities, disparities between clinic protocols, and resistance from medical personnel as barriers. The legal uncertainty is exacerbated by a political landscape where far-right politicians seek to further restrict the limited provisions within the country's penal code.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, who honored Juneteenth in his first four years as president, remained silent about the holiday this year. This contrasts with his previous acknowledgements, including a claim that he made Juneteenth "very famous." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Trump would not be signing a Juneteenth proclamation, deviating from earlier guidance. In previous years, Trump issued statements recognizing the end of slavery and the contributions of African Americans.
