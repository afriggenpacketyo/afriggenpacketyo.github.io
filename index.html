          <p>President Trump announced a "kinetic strike" in the Caribbean Sea that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers from Venezuela. The operation targets what the administration calls narco-terrorist organizations, adding to escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas. While Trump allies see this as a move against Nicolás Maduro's regime, some experts view the military buildup as political signaling rather than a prelude to a full-scale intervention. The individuals killed were reportedly members of the Tren de Aragua crime group.</p>

The court decided that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser or the Android operating system. While Google must end certain exclusive contracts and share some search data with rivals, investors reacted positively, viewing the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant and a sign that the market had anticipated more draconian measures.

          <p>The 42-story One California Plaza tower in downtown Los Angeles has been placed into receivership after its owners defaulted on a $300-million debt. The building's value has plummeted by 74% from its peak, now appraised at just $121.2 million, with its occupancy dropping to 62%. This event highlights the severe challenges facing the downtown L.A. office market, which is struggling with high vacancy rates from remote work, elevated interest rates, and public safety concerns, contributing to significant devaluations of commercial properties.

          <p>While China prepares for a major military parade to showcase its modernized forces, some of its most advanced and potent weapon systems will be conspicuously absent. The article notes that cutting-edge assets, such as the next-generation J-36 and J-50 stealth fighter jets, remain hidden from public view. These systems are either still under development, considered too strategically sensitive to reveal, or are not suitable for inclusion in a parade format, indicating the full scope of China's military capabilities extends beyond what is publicly displayed.</p>

          <p>A retired command sergeant major with combat experience in the Middle East writes about the unsettling sight of armed National Guard soldiers patrolling civilian spaces in Washington D.C. The author argues that deploying young, inexperienced soldiers for urban policing is a dangerous misuse of the military, risking an erosion of trust between the public and the armed forces. He warns that normalizing such deployments blurs the line between protector and occupier, a trend he has witnessed in failed states abroad, and undermines the foundations of American democracy.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, Abbe Lowell, the lawyer for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, stated that his client never committed mortgage fraud and argued that President Trump lacks legal cause for her termination. The filing contends that the federal government and the White House were aware of the alleged inconsistencies in her mortgage applications before her Senate confirmation in 2022. Lowell frames the firing as a pretext for Trump's true goal of pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, thereby threatening the central bank's independence.</p>

The petition, led by Rep. Thomas Massie, aims to bypass leadership and is creating fractures within the GOP, with Massie claiming he has the votes despite pressure from Donald Trump. Johnson argues the House Oversight Committee's investigation is a better approach, as it allows for the redaction of sensitive information to protect victims.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff have formally requested that the Department of Defense provide a detailed breakdown of the recent deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles. The California Democrats are seeking information on the specific missions, costs to taxpayers, and any law enforcement activities undertaken by the troops, who were deployed over the objections of state and local officials. Their letter comes as a federal judge ruled the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars using the military for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of employees at California's Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon national parks have overwhelmingly voted to unionize with the National Federation of Federal Employees. The move comes amid significant turmoil within the National Park Service, which has faced unprecedented staff and budget cuts under the Trump administration, leading to overworked and demoralized staff. Organizers say the successful union drive was fueled by employee concerns over reductions in force, threats to workplace protections, and the strain of managing the parks with inadequate resources.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which allowed Prime members to share their free two-day shipping benefits with one person outside their household. The company has begun notifying users that the program will end on October 1, 2025. Going forward, users who want to share benefits must live at the same residential address under the Amazon Family program. The move tightens access to Prime perks and comes amid reports that U.S. signups for the service during the recent Prime Day event fell short of targets.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff revealed that the company reduced its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 people due to the implementation of artificial intelligence. He explained that "AI agents" have automated certain customer service tasks, increasing efficiency and reducing the need for human support engineers. This confirms that AI is already replacing some jobs in the tech sector, as companies invest heavily in the technology to cut costs and streamline operations. Benioff noted that many affected employees were redeployed to other roles within the company.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight increase on Tuesday, rising above the $110,000 mark while the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The market turbulence was driven by concerns over the legality of U.S. tariffs, which also propelled gold to a new record high above $3,500. While Bitcoin benefited from some safe-haven interest, its performance lagged behind gold, partly due to a recent investor rotation into Ethereum, which has been the crypto market leader for much of the summer.

The family's stake of 22.5 billion tokens remains locked and cannot be sold yet. This venture highlights President Trump's increasing embrace of digital assets during his second term, a shift that has raised concerns among watchdog groups about potential conflicts of interest between his family's business ventures and his administration's policies.

Vowing to continue his work for peace and justice, Mahdawi stated that the government's attempt to silence him had failed and made him more outspoken, though he expressed disappointment in the university's lack of support.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has authorized approximately 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges to address a massive case backlog and a shortage of judges. This move follows a recent change that lowered the qualification requirements, removing the need for prior immigration law experience. The rapid pace of arrests under the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies has overwhelmed the court system, which has also lost over 100 judges in the last nine months, prompting this unusual measure to fill the gap.</p>
