        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many California residents are struggling with high transportation costs, making car ownership unaffordable for some. Franchescoli Andrade, a South Los Angeles resident, spends 90 minutes each way commuting to work via bike, train, and bus after being unable to afford car repairs. A United Way study indicates that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living costs, including transportation, which can exceed $12,000 per year for car ownership. While moving to more affordable areas might seem like a solution, it is often impractical due to family and community ties, leaving many families like Andrade's struggling to make ends meet. The article highlights the increasing financial burden of transportation, along with housing and childcare, nationwide. </p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's account was temporarily suspended on Bluesky, a social media platform seen as a liberal alternative to X, shortly after he joined. Bluesky stated that the suspension was due to automated systems flagging the account as a potential impersonation attempt, as there had been previous attempts to impersonate Vance. The account was reinstated within 20 minutes and verified. Vance's initial posts included a screenshot of Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion on a Tennessee law banning sex change surgeries on minors, sparking debate and mockery from conservatives who viewed the suspension as evidence of censorship.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" makes over six figures annually by reporting idling trucks and buses through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. This program allows citizens to report vehicles idling for more than three minutes, a violation of New York City law, and receive 25% of the fines, which range from $350 to $600. George Pakenham, who helped create the law, emphasizes that it addresses a public health issue, reducing air pollution. Trucking Association of New York lobbyist Zach Miller argues that truck drivers face challenges that make it difficult to simply shut off their engines, but Pakenham maintains the importance of reducing vehicle idling for public health.</p>

          <p>The Buss family is reportedly selling a majority ownership stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in a deal valuing the team at $10 billion. Walter's TWG Global group's acquisition marks the richest transaction in sports history, with Jeanie Buss remaining as Lakers governor. Since Walter's acquisition of the Dodgers in 2012, the team has consistently made the playoffs, winning multiple division titles and World Series championships, contrasting with the Lakers' more sporadic success. The move is expected to bring significant investment in infrastructure, coaching, and scouting, potentially reshaping the team's approach to player acquisition and long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a decision with broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth. In a 6-3 ruling, the court rejected the challenge that the law violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, concluding that the state's measure does not violate the 14th Amendment. The court found that Tennessee's law is not subject to heightened judicial review and satisfies the rational basis standard. Dissenting justices argued that the law discriminates against transgender adolescents and conditions the availability of medications on the patient's sex.</p>

The Financial Times notes that the US "holds the key" to destroying Iran's underground nuclear sites. The Times says the UK is weighing military support for the US in the event of a strike, while the Daily Telegraph reports that the Attorney General warned UK involvement "could be illegal."</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a case that has garnered national attention. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene, but convicted her of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The trial, which had previously collapsed due to a hung jury, saw Read's defense argue she was framed. Read was greeted by supporters outside the courthouse, while the O'Keefe family expressed their disappointment and maintained the prosecution was tainted by lies.</p>

          <p>President Trump approved attack plans on Iran but has not made a final decision on whether to strike, according to intelligence and defense sources. The decision is pending Tehran's potential agreement to abandon its nuclear program. Trump stated he would make the final decision at the last moment due to changing circumstances, and that he may or may not act. Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, while maintaining that it will "respond to any threat with a counter-threat."</p>

          <p>A California appeals court sided with a former middle school student who sued the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect her from bullying. Eleri Irons, now in her 20s, was awarded a $1-million jury verdict in 2022, which the district must now pay after losing the appeal. The lawsuit claimed that Irons was bullied and verbally assaulted by three students while attending El Segundo Middle School, with the bullying escalating after she sought help from a school counselor and other school officials. The appeals court rejected the district's arguments that it was immune to liability and that Irons failed to prove injuries caused by employee negligence.</p>

Researchers also uncovered widespread racial misclassification, with 41% of AI/AN deaths incorrectly classified, predominantly as “White.” Accurate data collection and reporting are essential to ensure equitable health resources and policy attention for AI/AN communities.</p>

The decision will be influenced by various factors, including sluggish economic growth, persistent inflation, and global tensions. Economists hold differing views, with some projecting two more rate cuts this year, while others expect only one due to persistent wage growth and the inflationary effects of government spending.</p>

The disagreement has fueled divisions within Trump's "America First" movement over whether the US should intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict.
