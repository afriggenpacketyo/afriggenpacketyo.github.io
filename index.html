          <p>Overnight Israeli airstrikes across Gaza resulted in at least 54 Palestinian deaths, according to hospital directors, including a strike on a school in Gaza City housing displaced families from Beit Lahia. The Hamas-run Civil Defence reported 20 bodies recovered from the school, many severely burned, with the Israeli military claiming the area was a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center used to plan attacks. Residents described widespread fires and charred bodies, while local reports identified a Hamas police official among the dead, along with his family; a separate strike in Jabalia killed 19 people. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the Jabalia strike.</p>

Armstrong drew inspiration from figures like Zuckerberg, Altman, Andreessen, and Thiel, as well as tech-centric podcasts, to create characters that embody the arrogance and philosophical approach of Silicon Valley barons.

          <p>Peter R. Orszag, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, argues that it's time to worry about the national debt due to rising deficits and interest rates. He notes that annual federal budget deficits are at 6% of GDP, and the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare. Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and focusing on fiscal savings in entitlement programs. He concludes that recognizing the elevated fiscal risks is the first step toward fiscal health and reducing the budget deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has begun allowing Taiwanese individuals marrying Japanese citizens to list Taiwan as their place of origin in the family registry system, a change welcomed by Taiwan but opposed by China. Previously, the registry listed Taiwanese individuals as being from China. The Justice Ministry's revision aligns the family registry with Japan's residence registry, aiming to protect the rights and interests of Taiwanese in Japan. This decision reflects Japan's stance of maintaining non-governmental relations with Taiwan while respecting China's claim over the island.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defends Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," arguing they have a "moral component" because those who "refuse" to work are "defrauding the system." He insists the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP, but focuses on fraud, waste, and abuse. Johnson claims many able-bodied workers are taking advantage of the system and putting them to work will benefit them and the community. The bill faces opposition in the Senate, with concerns about the impact on low-income individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dual US-German citizen, Joseph Neumeyer, has been charged with attempting to attack the US Embassy in Tel Aviv using Molotov cocktails. Neumeyer was arrested after a confrontation with a security guard, who recovered a backpack containing the devices. He had traveled from the US to Canada and then to Israel, and allegedly made threatening social media posts before the incident. Israeli officials deported Neumeyer to New York, where he faces federal charges.</p>

          <p>Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president, has proposed creating a large "buffer zone" in Ukraine to protect Russian territory from Western weapons. The proposed zone would encompass nearly all of Ukraine, excluding a small area near the Polish border. Analysts estimate that at Russia's current rate of advance, achieving this goal would take approximately 91 years and cost 50 million soldiers, highlighting the impracticality of the proposal.</p>
