          <p>Sarah Lin, a high school senior from the Bronx, is advocating for the Open Captioning Accessibility Act in New York, aiming to make movie theaters more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Inspired by her mother's progressive hearing loss, Lin is collaborating with the Hearing Loss Association of America's New York Chapter to push for the bill's passage before the end of the legislative session. The act would mandate that movie theaters offer some showings with open captions, providing a more reliable option than current assistive devices, which are often faulty. Lin hopes New York's action will influence other states to adopt similar measures, urging people to contact their local representatives to support the act. Optimism is present as the act seems likely to pass. </p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced $499 smartphone, the T1, will be manufactured in the U.S., experts suggest it will likely be produced in China. The phone, running Google's Android operating system, is advertised as "built in the United States," but analysts believe it will be designed and manufactured by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). Experts cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the impracticality of establishing large-scale production quickly as reasons for this prediction. This comes after Trump's previous scrutiny of Apple's supply chain and his desire to see more electronics manufacturing in the U.S. There is skepticism around the actual production of the phone. </p>

Announced during the Cannes Lions festival, the two new features aim to assist brands in leveraging discussions on the platform, powered by an engine called Reddit Community Intelligence. The company announced Reddit Insights, a "listening tool" providing real-time insights for marketers to identify trends and launch campaigns, along with Conversation Summary Add-ons, enabling brands to display "positive" user content under their ads. The company emphasizes that these tools are designed for a new era of community marketing, allowing brands to tap into Reddit's authenticity and connect meaningfully with high-intent communities globally. The launch of these tools seems to be a positive direction for the company. </p>

          <p>The June CNBC Fed Survey reveals that respondents anticipate weaker economic growth and higher inflation, with uncertainty surrounding tariff policy remaining high, although the probability of a recession in the next year has decreased from 53% to 38%. Respondents expect the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady at the June meeting, with rate cuts anticipated in September, projecting two rate cuts this year and one next year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end. While a majority expect the U.S. to strike a new trade deal with China within five months, concerns remain about the inflationary impact of tariffs.

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, viewing the regime as an existential threat. While Israel's strikes have targeted Khamenei's inner circle, killing top generals and security advisors, experts note that Iran's theocratic system has a process for maintaining stability. Despite Netanyahu's call for Iranians to rise up against their leadership, analysts suggest that internal tensions, rather than external pressure, are more likely to cause a regime change. Even if Israel's actions don't immediately topple Iran's rulers, they could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their clerical leaders, potentially at one of the ayatollah's weakest moments. This is a tense and uncertain situation. </p>

          <p>As an extreme heat warning is issued for parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada, Americans are being advised to limit coffee consumption to avoid dehydration. The National Weather Service encourages people to stay hydrated, use sunscreen, and plan outdoor activities during cooler parts of the day, while cautioning against alcohol, caffeine, and heavy foods. Registered dietitian-nutritionist Lauren Manaker notes that while moderate caffeine consumption is generally safe, larger quantities can act as a mild diuretic, increasing the risk of dehydration. Manaker suggests milk as a surprising hydrating alternative, packed with electrolytes, carbohydrates, and protein, which helps the body recover and retain fluids after exercise.

This decision comes amid pressure from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to replace synthetic dyes with natural alternatives. While 10% of Kraft Heinz's products currently contain artificial dyes, the company has been investing in removing or replacing them with natural colors, with many products already using natural or no colors. The FDA is also working to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026 through voluntary efforts from the food industry. The move towards natural dyes is a positive step. </p>

          <p>Former Senator Bob Menendez reported to the Federal Correctional Institution, Schuylkill, in Pennsylvania, to begin serving an 11-year sentence following his conviction on federal bribery charges. Menendez was convicted last year of accepting bribes in exchange for political favors, including protecting New Jersey business owners from criminal investigations and assisting Egypt in accessing U.S. military aid. FBI agents found $480,000 in cash, gold bars, and a luxury convertible in his home. Menendez, who resigned his seat after his conviction, has maintained his innocence and appeared to be angling for a pardon from President Trump. This is a downfall for the former senator. </p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is monitoring the construction of a new facility at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex, which is similar to a known uranium enrichment site. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi expressed serious concern over North Korea's undeclared enrichment facilities, stating that the continuation and further development of the DPRK's nuclear program violate UN Security Council resolutions. Analysts suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sees an even greater atomic weapons capability as critical to the survival of his regime. The situation raises concerns about regional proliferation, with potential implications for South Korea's own nuclear deterrent. The construction is a cause for concern. </p>

The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent directors and can veto the other two choices, giving the president significant control over the company's decisions.
