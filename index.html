          <p>James E. Ryan, the president of the University of Virginia since 2018, has resigned from his position. The move comes after the Trump administration reportedly pressured the university to remove him over its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the administration aims to eliminate from higher education. In his resignation letter, Ryan stated he could not unilaterally fight the federal government and risk jobs, funding, and student aid, noting he had already planned for the next year to be his last. The decision has drawn criticism from Democratic senators, who called it an "outrageous" move driven by culture wars.</p>

          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Following his win, moderate business leaders and politicians began strategizing to oppose him in the general election, with some considering backing an independent candidate to challenge his progressive platform. In contrast, prominent progressives like former Mayor Bill de Blasio have dismissed concerns about Mamdani's electability, arguing his win legitimizes his positions. Mamdani himself is engaging with concerned business leaders, aiming to build a broad coalition ahead of the November election.</p>

The pandasâ€”a 24-year-old female named Rauhin and her three offspringâ€”were transported to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, who are also scheduled to return to China by February of next year. The Wakayama zoo, which has had a successful breeding program since 1994, expressed hope in preparing to accept new pandas in the future.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber targeted a military convoy in the North Waziristan district of northwestern Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 soldiers. The attack, which also injured 29 others including civilians, occurred when an attacker rammed a vehicle filled with explosives into the convoy. The Hafiz Gul Bahadur armed group, an affiliate of the Pakistani Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the bombing. This incident is part of a significant increase in violence in the regions of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan since the Taliban regained power in Kabul in 2021.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian explores President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the conflict between Israel and Iran. The author, Gary Nunn, argues that while unconventional for a president, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many observers. The article suggests that the public is tired of overly polished and scripted political speech, and that judicious, genuine use of strong language can sometimes make politicians appear more human and trustworthy. It contrasts this with the private swearing of past presidents, noting that Trump's public use breaks a long-standing norm in political discourse.</p>

          <p>American consumers may face higher prices and potential shortages of fireworks for this year's Independence Day celebrations due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. relies on China for nearly all of its consumer and professional fireworks, which were hit with significant tariffs this spring, forcing some importers to halt deliveries. The American Pyrotechnics Association warns that people will likely get "a little less bang for their bucks" and encourages early shopping. The industry is particularly concerned about 2026, the nation's 250th birthday, as continued high tariffs could severely impact the scale of celebrations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unexpectedly postponed its decision on a contentious Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case, Louisiana v. Callais, centers on whether a new map with a second majority-Black district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, a map the state legislature claims was a politically motivated move to protect incumbents. This delay leaves the future of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against racial discrimination in elections, uncertain. Legal experts are now watching closely, as the eventual ruling could significantly alter how race is considered in redistricting nationwide.</p>

The administration celebrated a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies, and a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including dozens of trade deals facing a July deadline and the uncertain fate of his major tax and policy package, dubbed the "one big beautiful bill," in the Senate.

          <p>In response to intensified Russian airstrikes using modernized Shahed drones, Ukraine is ramping up its use and production of specialized interceptor drones. These new Russian drones can fly at higher altitudes, making them difficult for mobile air defense units to target, prompting a strategic shift. Experts and military officials state that interceptor drones are a more effective and cost-efficient solution, with a single drone costing around $5,000 compared to anti-aircraft missiles that can cost up to $1 million. Ukraine is now collaborating with partners and domestic manufacturers to mass-produce these drones and train pilots to defend its cities and infrastructure.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the current system is overly complex and needs "more doers and fewer checkers."

More than 30 embassies and numerous members of the European Parliament have voiced their support for the event.

          <p>A growing divide on energy policy has emerged within Germany's coalition government, particularly concerning the role of nuclear power. The dispute became public after Economy Minister Katherina Reiche attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official phase-out of nuclear energy. Environment Minister Carsten Schneider, whose party opposes nuclear power, criticized the move, emphasizing Germany's commitment to renewable energy. This disagreement reflects a broader tension over how to achieve climate neutrality, with factions supporting different energy sources and raising concerns about the feasibility of the government's climate goals.</p>

          <p>According to a top economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment systems like WeChat and Alipay give the country a "comparative advantage" in the developing field of stablecoins. Chief Economist Peng Wensheng argued that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and are supported by a mature regulatory framework. He noted that these systems are extensions of legal tender with strong safeguards, including backing by central bank money. This analysis comes as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain competitive in the global financial technology race. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts emphasize that a car's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature can rise three to five times faster than an adult's. To prevent these tragedies, safety officials recommend the "ACT" acronym: Avoid leaving children unattended, Create reminders, and Take action immediately by calling 911 if you see a child alone in a car.</p>

Holland, an industry veteran, stated he missed the excitement of having all teams, prospects, and their families together in one arena.
