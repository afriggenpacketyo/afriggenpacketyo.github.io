        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Victoria McCloud, a trans former judge, expressed concerns that the Supreme Court's ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts transgender people at risk. McCloud is planning to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing the court did not hear from trans people before its ruling. She fears that the ruling, which defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law, endangers trans individuals in public spaces, citing personal safety concerns. McCloud feels unsafe using male restrooms and believes the policy is dangerous, while others argue for the safety and privacy of women's spaces. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses Justice Clarence Thomas's long-held belief in individual rights over group rights and how it has influenced the Supreme Court's recent decisions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Thomas has consistently argued that American law should protect individual rights rather than group rights, criticizing the use of social science evidence in cases like Brown v. Board of Education. The recent Supreme Court decision in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, which Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote, signals a shift away from DEI programs that favor certain groups, aligning with Thomas's view that American law protects individual rights. Thomas suggests that DEI initiatives have often led to discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are working to adhere to President Xi Jinping's austerity measures, ensuring modest offices and proper meal receipts, as inspectors conduct checks. The campaign, running since 2012, targets overspending among Communist Party and government bodies to improve the party's image, combat corruption, and reduce wasteful spending. Analysts suggest the campaign aims to ensure wise spending in China's rivalry with the United States and identify loyal cadres for promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to strict media control and the difficulty of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>

          <p>Six Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli gunfire near a Gaza aid distribution center, according to Hamas officials. The incident occurred as people gathered to collect food supplies, with reports suggesting Israeli forces opened fire when individuals approached the site.

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the department's plans following the House settlement agreement with the NCAA, which allows schools to directly pay athletes. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing, maintaining Olympic sports programs and current scholarship limits for at least a year. Revenue will be shared primarily with football and men's basketball players, following a formula similar to the back-payment model. The ability to pay players directly could help UCLA compete with other Big Ten schools and narrow the resource gap.</p>
