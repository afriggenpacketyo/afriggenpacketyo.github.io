          <p>Jalen Brunson's stellar performance, with 39 points and 12 assists, propelled the New York Knicks to a 121-113 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 4, putting them one win away from their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 25 years. The Celtics, defending champions, now face a daunting 3-1 deficit and a potential injury to All-Star Jayson Tatum, who was carried off the court with a leg injury. Despite leading by double digits early in the game, the Celtics faltered in the second half as the Knicks rallied, setting up a decisive Game 5 in Boston. The Knicks' resilience and Brunson's leadership were key to their victory, delighting fans who haven't seen their team in the conference finals since 2000.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' aviation council has ruled that Russia is responsible for the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in the deaths of all 298 people on board, including many Dutch and Australian citizens. The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) stated that Russia failed to uphold its obligations under international air law. While the ICAO lacks regulatory powers, this ruling is a significant step towards achieving justice and accountability for the victims and sends a message that states cannot violate international law with impunity. The Netherlands and Australia are seeking reparations from Russia for the incident, which involved a Russian-made BUK missile.</p>

          <p>Jacqueline Ma, a former San Diego County educator and once named teacher of the year, has been sentenced to 30 years to life for grooming and sexually assaulting two young boys in her elementary school classroom. Ma exploited her position as a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher to manipulate her victims with gifts and special attention, even creating an unsanctioned after-school program for one boy. She performed sexual acts on the boy in her classroom over a three-month period, while his parents thought he was participating in an after-school basketball program, prosecutors said. The case came to light after a mother discovered inappropriate messages between her son and Ma, leading to an investigation that uncovered a second victim.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended the White House's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating that the U.S. has helped Qatar significantly over the years and that accepting the jet would be a "very nice gesture." The potential value of the plane, estimated at $400 million, has raised legal and ethical questions, particularly concerning the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics from both sides of the political spectrum have expressed concerns about the deal, with some calling for investigations into the matter, while the White House maintains that any gift will be accepted in full compliance with applicable laws.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance for local municipalities to address homeless encampments, emphasizing that there are "no more excuses" for inaction. Newsom is also announcing new funding for treatment and housing, urging cities and counties to do their part in addressing the homelessness crisis. The model ordinance stipulates that policies must prioritize shelter and services and not unduly limit local authority to clear encampments, while also adhering to the principle that no person should face criminal prosecution for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his final term amid speculation about his political future.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, have dismissed the traffic charges that led Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student who has lived in the United States since she was four. The Dalton Police Department admitted that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle, as the vehicle that made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving. Despite the dismissal of charges, Arias Cristobal remains in ICE custody and faces deportation, along with her father, who was also arrested following a traffic stop. This case highlights the Trump administration's expanded enforcement of immigration laws, leading to the arrest of undocumented immigrants without criminal records.</p>

          <p>The auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York revealed a cautious art market, with many objects presold and a lack of enthusiastic bidding, reflecting economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Louise Riggio consigned nearly 40 works from her collection built with her late husband, Barnes & Noble founder Leonard Riggio. While the collection totaled $272 million with fees, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. The top lot, a Mondrian painting, sold for $47.6 million, less than the previous record for a Mondrian. Despite some signs of life with paintings by Richter, Van Gogh, and Frankenthaler selling above estimates, the overall sale indicated a market correction from the peak in 2022.</p>

          <p>Asian shares experienced gains after China and the United States announced a 90-day truce in their trade war, but these gains were tempered by lingering uncertainties. The agreement involves cutting tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from as high as 145% by the United States, and China reducing its tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. While the outcome surpassed expectations, analysts cautioned that President Trump's policies could still quickly change. The S&P 500 in the United States also saw a significant increase, pulling back within 5% of its all-time high, fueled by hopes of further trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan's improved security situation and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return. This decision reverses the Biden administration's extension of TPS for Afghanistan, which cited a humanitarian crisis following the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Advocates have criticized the move, arguing it will have long-lasting ripple effects. The administration has also sought to roll back TPS for Venezuela, but a judge halted that move.</p>

Ley, from the moderate faction of the party, won by a narrow margin against Angus Taylor, who advocated for restoring conservative values. The Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, attributed to polarizing leaders and policies that alienated women and young people. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, acknowledging that many feel neglected by the Liberal Party.

          <p>House Republicans have proposed sharp restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aiming to limit funding and benefits as part of a package to advance President Trump's tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding for food stamps and impose stricter work requirements on beneficiaries, potentially causing millions of low-income families to lose access to the program. Republicans argue that these changes will improve the program and control costs, while critics contend that they would deepen hunger and poverty. The proposed changes include expanding work requirements to recipients up to age 64 and limiting aid to U.S. citizens and green card holders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed funding cuts threaten to end decades of critical scientific research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including the ongoing collection of CO2 samples. This program, which began with Professor Charles David Keeling, has been monitoring CO2 levels since the 1960s and provides crucial data on climate change. Ralph Keeling, Charles's son, warns that these cuts would eliminate funding for NOAA's global CO2 program, degrading the nation's ability to project future climate change impacts. The elimination of this program would be detrimental to understanding the unchecked rise of carbon dioxide.</p>

To foster lasting trust, China must demonstrate openness, consistency, and a commitment to multilateral dialogue, particularly regarding South China Sea disputes. The Global Security Initiative promotes resolving disputes through peaceful dialogue, but translating this vision into reality requires genuine commitment and transparency.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking the highest rate of growth since 2014, excluding the COVID-19 rebound, driven by the oil and gas sector and strong growth in tech and finance. The World Bank expects this growth to slightly increase in 2025 to 3.7%. This growth comes amid President Bola Tinubu's economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira currency. However, the reforms have resulted in a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with nearly half the population living in poverty and inflation expected to remain high at an average of 22.1%.</p>

After being captured in 1966 and spending six and a half years in the "Hanoi Hilton," Peterson decided to "leave his hate at the gate" and contribute to reconciliation. As ambassador, he sought accountability for missing Americans and negotiated a key trade agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam.

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs, driven by factors like unpredictable US trade policy, geopolitical uncertainty, and fears of inflation. While gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations, and major surges have been followed by significant falls in the past. Central banks have also been net buyers of gold, adding to their official reserves. Experts warn that the recent surge may be forming a market bubble, and investors should consider diversifying their portfolios rather than putting all their eggs in a golden basket.

GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat, but their use should be considered for people with excess visceral fat who have begun to suffer its consequences. The article emphasizes the importance of considering waist size and blood-lipid patterns over BMI as measures of metabolic health. It calls for the FDA to require pharmaceutical companies to gather data on long-term use and safe discontinuation of GLP-1 drugs, and advocates for a more nuanced approach to treating metabolic disease.</p>
