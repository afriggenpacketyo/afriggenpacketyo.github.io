          <p>President Trump's contemplation of joining Israel in striking Iran has revealed deep rifts among his supporters, pitting isolationist and hawkish factions against each other.

The indictment says the defendants watched as a Brinks truck was loaded with jewels and then followed the truck for approximately 300 miles (485 km) from San Mateo to Lebec, California.
