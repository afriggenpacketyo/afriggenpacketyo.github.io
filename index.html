          <p>China's military monitored US and UK warships transiting the Taiwan Strait, condemning the action as a "harassment and provocation" that undermines regional stability. The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command stated the passage sent "wrong signals" and that its forces remain on high alert to safeguard national sovereignty. This event follows a similar transit by Canadian and Australian warships a week prior, which also drew a warning from Beijing, highlighting ongoing tensions in the strategically important waterway.</p>

          <p>A new border wall, erected as part of a demarcation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has physically divided the Armenian village of Kirants. This development, following Azerbaijan's control over Nagorno-Karabakh, has resulted in villagers losing access to their land and property, causing economic hardship and emotional distress. While the wall has brought a halt to local gunfire and increased a sense of security for some, many residents remain anxious about the long-term stability and the loss of their homeland.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo began with athletes facing grueling heat and humidity, with temperatures climbing to 30°C. Japan celebrated its first medal as Hayato Katsuki won bronze in the men's 35km race walk, a poignant moment for the host nation after the spectator-less 2020 Olympics. The challenging conditions led to several competitors collapsing, prompting organizers to adjust start times for upcoming marathon events to mitigate health risks for the athletes.</p>

This score surpassed his previous personal high of 18 on a hole, set in 1998, and broke the previous tour record for the highest score on a single hole by three shots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday album is a relic of a pre-feminist culture where the sexual exploitation of young girls by adult men was normalized in media and society. The author, Rebecca Solnit, recounts examples from 1970s and 80s films and music that portrayed such relationships as acceptable, framing the "sexual revolution" as often serving male desires. The piece concludes that feminist movements have been crucial in challenging these norms, insisting on consent and exposing the power dynamics that enable abuse.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing pressure over his initial defense of Lord Mandelson, who was later dismissed as ambassador to the US due to newly revealed emails with Jeffrey Epstein. According to reports, government officials were aware of the emails' existence before Starmer defended Mandelson, though the Prime Minister himself had not seen their contents. The emails, which showed a supportive relationship with the convicted sex offender, led to Mandelson's sacking and have prompted criticism of the government's vetting process.</p>

          <p>The upcoming super middleweight title fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford is being billed as an era-defining clash with significant implications for both fighters' legacies. Crawford, moving up two weight classes, aims to become the first male boxer in the four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three divisions. The bout presents a classic contrast in styles, pitting Álvarez's power and experience at higher weights against Crawford's speed, technical skill, and undefeated record.</p>

          <h2>Missouri Legislature Passes Republican-Drawn Congressional Map</h2>

          <p>The Missouri state legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan, backed by former President Trump, which is expected to create an additional Republican-leaning district. The new map redraws the Kansas City area, making the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver more competitive and potentially shifting the state's delegation from 6-2 to 7-1 in favor of Republicans. The move, part of a nationwide push for mid-decade redistricting, was immediately met with a legal challenge arguing it is an unconstitutional gerrymander.</p>
