          <p>The recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a national conversation about political violence and its professional consequences. Several employees across various industries, including media and transportation, have been fired for their public statements regarding Kirk's death. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for comments that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. This situation highlights the limited First Amendment protections for workers in the private sector when expressing views on controversial topics.</p>

          <p>American Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from his semi-final race at the world championships following an incident on the home straight. Officials ruled that Hocker was guilty of "jostling" after he pushed through a tight pack of runners, making contact with Germany's Robert Farken, to secure a second-place finish. Hocker stated he was trying to find a gap and get through as cleanly as possible but was boxed in. Despite an appeal from the US team, the disqualification was upheld, preventing him from advancing to the final.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:02:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued the shift would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, a sentiment previously echoed by figures like Warren Buffett. Supporters of the current quarterly system maintain that it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors. The proposal aligns U.S. practices more closely with those in the U.K. and European Union, though critics argue it would reduce valuable market insight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has reported that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, had an apparent "obsession" with the conservative influencer. Investigators are examining Robinson's digital footprint and online chats to determine if there was a wider network or if others were aware of his intentions. DNA evidence found at the crime scene has linked Robinson to the crime, and President Trump has publicly called for the death penalty. The suspect's father reportedly played a key role in his son's surrender to authorities.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the gross negligence manslaughter of their infant daughter, Victoria.

          <p>A violent attack at a pool hall in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, has resulted in seven deaths and four injuries, marking the second such massacre in the city in under a month.

This incident is part of a broader wave of violence sweeping the nation, which serves as a key transit point for cocaine trafficking. Ecuador has experienced a significant increase in homicides this year amid ongoing struggles with powerful drug gangs, some with ties to international cartels.</p>

In a social media post, Trump called the endorsement a "shocking development" and suggested that federal funding for the city could be at risk if Mamdani wins the November election. Mamdani, a democratic socialist state lawmaker, won a surprise victory in the Democratic primary.

          <p>Following widespread youth-led protests against corruption that led to the prime minister's resignation, former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. The 73-year-old is known for her integrity and anti-corruption stance, having previously jailed a government minister for corruption during her time on the Supreme Court. Her appointment is seen as a reflection of growing trust in female leadership in the nation. Karki's primary challenges will be to restore normalcy, oversee the rebuilding of destroyed government buildings, and conduct fresh elections scheduled for March 2026.</p>

This surpasses their own previous record of 25 straight wins, a streak that was ended by New Zealand in the 2022 World Cup final. The team has not lost a match since that final and has been dominant, with their last defeat to any team other than New Zealand occurring in 2018.</p>

          <p>Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, is visiting Germany amid deep-seated mistrust and ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two nations. A key point of contention is Nawrocki's demand for war reparations from Germany, an issue he has emphasized since his election campaign. However, recent security concerns, prompted by Russian drones breaching Polish airspace, may shift the focus toward a potential German-Polish security partnership. Despite swift support from European NATO partners like Germany, Nawrocki's administration has historically prioritized its security relationship with the United States, creating a complex dynamic for the visit.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve rate cut expected this month, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers on how to strategically approach the changing market. Key recommendations include getting a freshly updated pre-approval to reflect increased buying power and promptly comparing offers from various lenders to secure the best terms before locking in a rate. Experts caution against assuming one's current lender will offer the best deal or trying to time the market by waiting for further rate drops. They also stress the importance of not overextending one's budget, even if qualifying for a larger loan, to maintain long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are experiencing confusion and frustration as their loans are transferred to new servicing companies, often with little direct notification. One borrower reported their loans were moved from Nelnet to a new servicer, Central Research, Inc. (CRI), and placed into an administrative forbearance without their request. Experts advise that during such transfers, borrowers should set aside their payment amounts but wait until the new account is fully active to avoid lost payments. It is also recommended to check credit reports after the transfer to ensure no payments were incorrectly reported as late.</p>

          <p>U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their highest weekly inflows since mid-July, pulling in approximately $2.3 billion. The sustained demand across five trading sessions was led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. This surge in investment aligns with growing expectations of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and has coincided with Bitcoin's price recovering above $115,000. Analysts suggest this indicates a clear demand impulse and growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a long-term asset class within standard investment portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

He criticized his former party for what he described as a "rule of failure," citing bigger government and higher taxes.

          <p>The watermelon has emerged as a prominent symbol of Palestinian solidarity, largely due to its colors—red, green, black, and white—which mirror the Palestinian flag. Its use as a protest symbol dates back to the 1980s, when Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in occupied territories. Artists and activists adopted the fruit as a subtle way to represent national identity. In the modern era, the watermelon emoji is widely used on social media to bypass censorship and express support for the Palestinian cause, connecting a new generation to a long history of cultural resistance.</p>

          <p>While AI tools are increasingly popular for job applications, career experts caution against over-reliance on them, which could harm a candidate's chances. A major pitfall is AI's tendency to "hallucinate" or fabricate information when asked to tailor a resume to a job description for which the candidate isn't a perfect match. Recruiters also note that AI-generated applications often lack authenticity and share a uniform structure, making them less impactful than those written in a candidate's own voice. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial generation, and always proofreading for errors.</p>
