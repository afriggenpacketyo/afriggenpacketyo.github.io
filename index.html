        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Secretary has announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively criminalizing membership and support of the group. This decision follows a protest in central London where arrests were made and vandalism at RAF Brize Norton, where activists spray-painted military planes red. The Home Secretary cited the group's "long history of unacceptable criminal damage" and threats to national security. The ban is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect other lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine or the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The White House asserts that U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have successfully destroyed Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the administration is confident the strikes "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities, including the Fordo site. The strikes targeted locations where Iran's enriched uranium was stored, preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon. This action follows concerns about Iran's nuclear program and its potential threat to global security.</p>

Prime Minister Modi clarified that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between the Indian and Pakistani militaries, emphasizing India's stance against external mediation. Experts suggest Trump's unpredictability and transactional approach to foreign policy are straining the relationship.

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has called on Iran to pursue diplomacy and return to the negotiating table following US strikes on its nuclear program. Lammy warned Iran against retaliating by attacking US bases or blockading the Strait of Hormuz, emphasizing the need for serious engagement with the E3 (UK, Germany, France) and the United States. The UK government maintains it was not involved in the US strikes but acknowledges the failure of previous diplomatic efforts to curb Iran's uranium enrichment. Lammy stressed that a nuclear-armed Iran would lead to nuclear proliferation and global instability.</p>

          <p>Financial experts address the common question of whether credit card debt can be inherited, clarifying that it generally cannot unless you are a co-signer or joint account holder. The deceased person's estate is typically responsible for settling debts, and if the estate lacks sufficient funds, the remaining balance may go unpaid. Spouses in community property states may be responsible for debt incurred during the marriage. It's advised to consult with an estate attorney to clarify legal responsibilities and avoid potential financial headaches.</p>

          <p>President Trump has hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran following US airstrikes on the country's nuclear facilities. This comes as both US and Israeli officials suggest military action could trigger an uprising against the Iranian regime. Israel has expanded its targets to include sites linked to the ruling theocracy's domestic authority, while Iran has launched missiles at Israel, leading to disruptions in electricity supply. The IAEA has called for a ceasefire to allow for inspections, while Iran vows "everlasting consequences."</p>

          <p>Uranium, a radioactive element more common than gold, is found in trace amounts in the environment. It has silver-white-gray finish and is very dense.

Exposure to high concentrations of uranium can be life-threatening, causing cancer and organ damage. The majority of the world's uranium production comes from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia.</p>

The strikes, which used high-tech American "bunker-buster" bombs, have caused an international outcry, with the UN's nuclear watchdog calling for an inspection.

          <p>Novo Nordisk is terminating its collaboration with Hims & Hers due to concerns about the company's sales and promotion of cheaper, unapproved versions of the weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk accused Hims & Hers of failing to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization and engaging in deceptive marketing practices. The drugmaker will continue offering Wegovy through telehealth organizations that share its commitment to safe and effective medical treatment.</p>
