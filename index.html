          <p>Netflix's stock has achieved an unprecedented 11-day winning streak, trading at all-time high levels since its 2002 IPO. This surge follows a strong earnings report revealing a 13% revenue increase in Q1 2025, driven by subscription and advertising growth. Netflix has outperformed traditional media stocks, which have been negatively impacted by market volatility stemming from Trump's trade policies. Despite price hikes, Netflix seems to have maintained its value proposition for consumers, although the company has stopped sharing membership numbers. The article suggests that Netflix's resilience in the face of economic uncertainty has bolstered investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's downturn, fueled by optimism surrounding potential trade discussions. However, anxieties persist among investors regarding the economic ramifications of President Trump's policies, particularly tariffs. The S&P 500 has recovered to pre-tariff levels, supported by a positive jobs report and indications of willingness from both the U.S. and China to engage in trade talks, though a deal remains distant. Despite this recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, and companies are struggling to forecast future performance due to trade policy uncertainty. The article underscores the market's sensitivity to the Trump administration's economic policies.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist after a three-year investigation. The BfV cited the party's actions against the constitution's fundamental principles, including human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law. This designation is likely to further isolate the AfD, despite its electoral strength as the country's largest opposition party. The article notes that mainstream parties have shunned the AfD, denying it governing coalition roles, and the BfV's decision may strengthen efforts to keep the AfD out of key parliamentary roles.</p>

          <p>Amid the largest measles outbreak in 25 years, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will direct federal health agencies to explore potential new treatments for the disease, including vitamins. This decision has drawn criticism, as experts fear it will undermine public confidence in vaccines, which are proven to be highly effective. Critics argue that Kennedy is focusing too much on untested treatments rather than promoting vaccination. Doctors have encountered measles patients who have delayed critical medical treatment in favor of unproven supplements.</p>

          <p>Paramilitary forces in Sudan are accused of killing more than 100 civilians in an attack on the city of Nahud, according to an association of doctors. The Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.) reportedly carried out a "large-scale massacre," with 21 children and 15 women among the dead. Communication with the city has been largely cut off, and the claims could not be independently verified. The article highlights the ongoing violence and humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with the U.N. reporting that at least 542 civilians have been killed in the region in just three weeks.</p>

          <p>Fuerza Regida, the multiplatinum corrido stars, have released their most spiritually minded album yet, “111XPANTIA,” marking a decade into their career. The album, recorded in their hometown of San Bernardino, delves further into the quintet’s Mexican heritage, encapsulating the group’s hustle, vision and evolution. The album title itself is made up of two parts: the first is a palindrome, “111,” which some regard as an “angel number,” or a lucky sign; the second is the Nahuatl word for manifestation, “ixpantia.” The article highlights the band's journey from playing covers at local parties to achieving success in the Latin music industry.</p>
