          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is in last-minute negotiations with the Treasury regarding her department's budget before Wednesday's Spending Review, despite receiving an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding. The impasse raises the possibility that the Treasury may impose a settlement on the Home Office prior to the review. Other government departments are also vying for increased funding, including the NHS, schools, and scientific research. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that modest growth rates necessitate sharp trade-offs in spending decisions, and Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticizes the government's spending priorities (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements experienced a significant drop in value last month, decreasing by nearly half compared to the previous year, reflecting Beijing's capacity to leverage its dominance in the critical mineral supply chain. The official data coincides with analysts suggesting that China's export controls over large quantities of critical minerals serve as a key bargaining chip in trade negotiations with the United States. May's value also represented a 13.7 percent monthly decline, from US$21.7 million in April. Despite this recent decrease, the cumulative amount of exported rare earths in the first five months of the year remains slightly higher than the same period last year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>According to a career coach, the U.S. job market is currently difficult for recent college graduates and experienced job seekers alike, with economists noting a steady erosion in the job market. CEO confidence has plummeted, with uncertainty around geopolitical instability and trade policies cited as major business risks. While businesses added more jobs than expected in May, overall gains have slowed significantly, indicating employers' reluctance to hire in an uncertain economic climate. An Indeed Hiring Lab economist suggests that the current low-hiring, slow-growth environment cannot continue indefinitely, as employers may eventually be forced to lay off existing employees (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs is currently on trial facing federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, with the concept of coercive control emerging as a key element, though not explicitly discussed in court. Coercive control involves a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse, which some experts believe played a significant role in Combs's relationships. While coercive control is not a widely recognized legal concept in the U.S., coercion as an individual act is crucial to the charges against Combs, with witnesses testifying to instances of physical and emotional coercion. The case highlights the ongoing debate about codifying coercive control in the legal system and the challenges of identifying and addressing nonphysical forms of abuse.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests began after Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations. Demonstrators have clashed with police, set vehicles on fire, and reportedly looted businesses, while authorities have declared an "unlawful assembly" in downtown LA and used riot gear, flash-bang grenades, and pepper spray to control crowds. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned Trump's actions as an "illegal" act and threatened to sue, while Mayor Karen Bass blames the administration for provoking chaos.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend a ban on ocean bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The proposed expansion would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasizing the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France, where countries are urged to ratify a treaty to protect a third of international waters by 2030.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that artificial intelligence is a "great equalizer" because it allows anyone to program using everyday language, making computing more accessible. Speaking at London Tech Week, Huang explained that AI programming now involves simply asking the computer to perform tasks, such as writing a poem or generating images, in a conversational manner. He highlighted that this new approach eliminates the need for specialized programming knowledge, as users can interact with AI systems in a way that mimics training a person. Huang's remarks underscore the transformative potential of AI in democratizing technology and empowering individuals to create and innovate.</p>

Trump's federalization of the guard troops marks the first time an American president has used such power since the 1992 LA riots without a request from the governor since 1965.

          <p>Democrats are reevaluating their organizing and turnout efforts after a lackluster performance in the recent election, with a study finding that a letter-writing campaign had no effect on turnout. This has prompted calls for more candid conversations about what works and what doesn't, as well as concerns that some turnout operations may inadvertently boost support for opposing candidates. While conventional turnout methods can still be effective in low-turnout races, the parties have seen diminishing returns on each individual mobilization tactic in presidential elections. Some believe that the party needs to invest in deeper engagement with voters, starting long before an election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed policy bill is facing opposition in the Senate, with Republicans divided over balancing tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and defense spending. The bill would increase the national debt by almost $2.6 trillion and potentially slash Medicaid benefits, drawing criticism from some Republican senators and Elon Musk. The bill's tax cuts disproportionately benefit the rich, while millions could become uninsured due to changes in ACA tax credits and Medicaid work requirements. The bill also includes provisions targeting immigrants and imposing new fees on asylum-seekers (not investment advice).</p>

The cuts prioritize "practical, quantitative" applications while slashing climate change studies and astrophysics, undermining the administration's professed goals.
