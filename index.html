          <p>Ryan Ferguson, wrongfully convicted of murder in 2005 and incarcerated for nearly a decade, has been awarded over $43 million by a Missouri judge. This follows a 2014 federal civil rights lawsuit where Ferguson was initially awarded $11 million. The recent judgment is against the city's insurer, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, after the officers involved could only pay $2.7 million. Ferguson's attorney stated that he was thrilled with the outcome, nearly as much as when his conviction was overturned. The officers involved will receive a percentage of the award.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise interest rates. The core inflation figure, which excludes fresh food costs, exceeded economists' expectations and surpassed April's rate of 3.5%. Rice prices saw a dramatic surge of 101.7% year-on-year, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. Despite the rising inflation, the BOJ has maintained its current interest rate of 0.5%, but Governor Kazuo Ueda indicated potential future rate hikes contingent on underlying inflation approaching the bank's 2% target.

The exact depth and reinforcement of the facility, located deep inside a mountain, are not fully known. Joe Cirincione, a nuclear proliferation researcher, notes that while an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it entirely.

          <p>A judge has denied Blake Lively's motion to keep text messages with Taylor Swift confidential in her legal battle against "It Ends With Us" co-star Justin Baldoni. The judge stated that since Lively indicated Swift had knowledge of complaints about the film's working environment, the messages are relevant to the case. Baldoni's team had subpoenaed Swift earlier this year but withdrew it after the singer's representatives dismissed it as a fishing expedition. Lively's representative claims Baldoni's actions are an attempt to exploit Swift's popularity and distract from accusations of sexual harassment.</p>

          <p>New ICE rules for Congress members visiting detention centers have been met with criticism, with experts claiming they are illegal. Several members of Congress have been denied entry to immigrant detention facilities, leading to accusations of obstructing congressional oversight. A federal statute states that funds cannot be used to prevent members of Congress from entering detention facilities for oversight purposes. ICE argues that the new guidelines are necessary for safety and security, but lawmakers and experts contend that they violate congressional authority.</p>
