            <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell is set to meet with Rev. Al Sharpton following criticism and calls for a boycott after the retailer scaled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Sharpton will consider calling for a boycott if Target doesn't reaffirm its commitment to the Black community and invest in Black-owned businesses. Target's decision to end DEI goals and reduce engagement with diversity-focused groups has led to a slowdown in foot traffic. This meeting highlights the ongoing tension between corporate policies and social activism, as well as the pressure companies face to maintain DEI initiatives. </p>

            <p>A memo reveals the Trump administration established broad criteria for detaining migrants at Guantanamo Bay, including those without criminal records, contradicting initial claims that only 'the worst' offenders would be held there. The agreement allows officials to send migrants with final deportation orders who have a 'nexus' to transnational criminal organizations, broadly defined, to the base. This policy has faced criticism for potentially targeting migrants who paid smugglers to enter the U.S. The ACLU has alleged that migrants were initially held incommunicado and described detention conditions as deplorable, though the administration has taken steps to improve access to lawyers.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly announced positive results from the first late-stage trial of its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, which helped Type 2 diabetes patients lower blood sugar and body weight. The pill demonstrated a weight loss of 7.9% on average after 40 weeks and a reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels. The side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, were generally mild to moderate, and the pill is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval by the end of the year for obesity. If approved, orforglipron could offer a needle-free alternative in the growing weight loss market. (not investment advice)</p>

Polling data suggests a potential shift in voter sentiment, with concerns about rising prices and the economy's overall health. While Trump maintains support among Republicans and some independents, Democrats are struggling to capitalize on economic discontent.

            <p>Scientists have found tentative evidence of life on the distant planet K2-18b, detecting molecules that, on Earth, are only produced by simple organisms. The James Webb Space Telescope identified chemical signatures of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the planet's atmosphere, gases produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria. While more data is needed to confirm these results, this is the second and more promising time that chemicals associated with life have been detected on the planet. The team hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon, but independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.</p>
