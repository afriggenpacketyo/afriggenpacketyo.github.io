          <p>A catastrophic flash flood in Texas resulted in at least 120 deaths over the July Fourth weekend, with dozens still missing. The disaster, exacerbated by the region's geography and a severe weather system, has prompted scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of official warnings and evacuation orders. While massive search efforts are underway, officials have cited the unprecedented nature of the "100-year flood" and public resistance to a costly warning system.</p>

          <p>The Salvadoran government informed the United Nations that Venezuelan migrants deported by the Trump administration to its CECOT maximum-security prison remain under U.S. jurisdiction. This assertion, based on a financial agreement, contradicts claims by U.S. officials that they cannot compel the migrants' return, potentially impacting ongoing court cases. Advocacy groups argue this reveals a lack of transparency and could influence legal challenges fighting the deportations.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump is set to make significant changes to the U.S. student loan system, which could make college more expensive for many. The law eliminates popular income-driven repayment plans like SAVE, replacing them with a less generous option, and imposes new borrowing caps that may hinder access to graduate and professional degrees. Critics argue that while the system is simplified, it will likely lead to higher monthly payments and greater financial strain for low-income students and families. (not investment advice)</p>
