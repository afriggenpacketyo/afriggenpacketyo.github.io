This message reinforces ideals of intensive mothering, especially stay-at-home mothering.

The article explores the challenges of reconciling Christianity with a liberal state and the potential for the task force to promote a vision of American Christian dominance.

          <p>Cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod discusses the biological roots of belief and whether ideology can be reduced to the brain. Zmigrod argues that political beliefs are neurological signatures influencing how individuals judge others and interact with the world. The interview explores how cognitive flexibility and rigidity impact one's comfort with change and ambiguity, and how ideologies serve as coping mechanisms for dealing with uncertainty. The conversation delves into the fine line between principles and dogmas, and how fear of uncertainty can drive rigid thinking. The article examines the intersection of biology, psychology, and political ideology.</p>
