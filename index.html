          <p>As fan enthusiasm for the show "The Summer I Turned Pretty" escalates into hostility, a board-certified psychiatrist has weighed in on the concerning trend. The show's network, Prime Video, even launched a campaign to promote kindness online after actors received threats from viewers who were intensely debating the main character's romantic choices. The psychiatrist suggests this behavior indicates a blurring of lines between fiction and reality, pointing to a psychological phenomenon known as parasocial relationships, which may be amplified by a societal void in human connection.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have arrested a suspect in the assassination of pro-Western politician Andriy Parubiy and claim a "Russian trace" in the killing. The suspect, allegedly disguised as a courier, shot Parubiy eight times in the city of Lviv. Parubiy was a key figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements and a vocal opponent of Russian influence, making his death a politically charged event. The assassination is viewed by Kyiv as another instance of Russia's hostile actions amid the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS signal disruption while approaching Bulgaria, an incident the EU suspects was caused by Russian interference. The pilots were forced to land the aircraft safely using alternative, non-satellite-based navigation methods. This event is seen as part of a pattern of Russian intimidation and has prompted the EU to reinforce its commitment to bolstering its defense capabilities and its support for Ukraine, as such interference poses a serious risk to aviation safety.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck a remote, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, killing more than 800 people and injuring nearly 3,000, according to the United Nations. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue operations struggle to reach the area, where entire villages have been flattened and access is blocked by landslides. The disaster compounds an already severe humanitarian crisis in the country, prompting the Taliban government to appeal for international aid to address the devastation.</p>

This stance represents a reversal of his administration's previous hardline position and has caused confusion among allies who view the students as potential security risks.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced a goal for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030, but the plan is met with considerable skepticism.

Critics argue the ambition is unrealistic and potentially dangerous without first addressing these fundamental economic and technological vulnerabilities.</p>
