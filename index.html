          <p>President Trump has issued another 90-day extension for the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S., marking the third such delay since January. The administration cites ongoing efforts to finalize a deal separating TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to ensure American users' data is secure. Trump expressed confidence that China would approve the deal, noting his past popularity on the app, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that TikTok was not discussed during recent trade talks with China. Congress passed the law last year due to national security concerns, giving ByteDance until January 19 to sever ties with TikTok or face a ban from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by masked ICE agents at federal immigration court while observing hearings, leading to dropped charges and widespread condemnation. According to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the charges against him have been dropped. Lander stated he was escorting a defendant out of court to prevent ICE arrest and expressed concern for the individual's due process rights. The ACLU of New York and other officials decried the arrest as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy, emphasizing the importance of protecting immigrants' rights to access public resources.</p>

          <p>Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to block the release or transfer of anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration detention center in Louisiana, arguing that courts lack the authority to intervene in the executive branch's detention decisions for noncitizens facing removal proceedings. The DOJ cited an ICE official's affidavit, which revealed that the ICE facility in Elizabeth had 355 detainees, meaning it was over capacity by 51 people. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, was arrested in March outside his apartment at Columbia University, and an immigration judge deemed him removable based on a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio citing Khalil's anti-Israel activism. First Amendment advocates have argued that the government is suppressing free speech by revoking the green card of a noncitizen who opposes the Israeli government. </p>

          <p>The Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a significant legislative victory for the crypto industry. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, sets guardrails including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and opens the door for various issuers like banks and retailers to launch stablecoins. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates the U.S. stablecoin market could grow to over $2 trillion in the next few years, expanding U.S. dollar usage globally. The bill now heads to the House, where reconciliation with its version, STABLE, will be needed due to differences in regulatory oversight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering adjustments to a key tax bill, potentially leading to a clash with the House. The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text addressing Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, aiming to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. The Senate version maintains the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while the House bill proposed lifting it to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000. The Senate version also includes deductions for tips and overtime pay, but with income phase-outs, and would boost the debt limit by $5 trillion, differing from the House's $4 trillion figure.

          <p>The Broadway musical “Real Women Have Curves” will end its run on June 29, less than two months after its official debut on April 27. Despite positive reviews, the show struggled at the box office, failing to reach full capacity and grossing below the expected amount for a large-scale Broadway production. The musical, adapted from Josefina López’s 1988 play and the 2002 HBO film, explores the American Dream through the story of Ana García, a driven teen working in a garment factory in Boyle Heights. Producers expressed pride in representing immigrant communities on Broadway, hoping the show could impact conversations surrounding immigration.</p>

          <p>High-ranking officials from the United States and China recently concluded trade talks in London, but details remain scarce, leading to speculation about the discussions' content and implications. The silence surrounding the talks suggests potential tensions, shifts in power dynamics, and the fragile state of global trade. China's tactics regarding export controls on rare earth elements, a key focus of the talks, may have caught the U.S. delegation off guard, adding complexity to the already delicate discussions.

While there is no full agreement among Trump's advisors, the issue was discussed in a meeting with his national security team. Israel has alleged Iran is making rapid progress toward building nuclear weapons, though a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year stated Iran is not currently building nuclear weapons. Trump has publicly supported TikTok and reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.</p>

Although some Democratic politicians have shown promise, the party as a whole struggles to unify and present a cohesive front against the Trump administration.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has informed employees that artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to a reduction in the company's corporate workforce in the coming years. In a memo, Jassy urged staff to embrace AI, stating that the technology will drive efficiency gains, resulting in fewer people needed for some current jobs. The tech giant is investing heavily in AI, joining other firms anticipating job losses, especially in entry-level office roles. While the majority of Amazon's 1.5 million employees work in warehouses, approximately 350,000 hold office positions.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates AI robots, or agents, will replace humans in the company's offices, leading to a reduced corporate workforce in the coming years. Jassy stated that Amazon is investing expansively in generative AI technology, and the company expects to need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today. Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, and some software engineers have reported an intensified work environment with pressure to use AI to increase productivity. Amazon's increased participation in generative AI began with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer explained that he quickly picked up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit because he feared the reaction of the White House security team if anyone else intervened. The incident occurred while Starmer and Trump were discussing a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer described as a “huge relief” for workers at Jaguar Land Rover and in the firm's supply chain. The trade deal removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and cuts the levy on cars exported from the UK to the US, but negotiations over steel import charges are ongoing. The pact has drawn criticism from opposition parties in the UK, with Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch calling it a "tiny tariff deal".</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 1,100 cases recorded and a significant outbreak in West Texas leading to the deaths of two children. The CDC reports infections in at least 32 states, highlighting the highly contagious nature of measles and the potential for severe complications, including death, especially among unvaccinated individuals. Health experts attribute the increase to lower vaccination rates, with data showing a decline in measles vaccination coverage among kindergarteners. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voiced support for vaccination as the deadly outbreak spread in the Southwest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and data storage is projected to drive up electricity consumption, leading to higher electricity bills for consumers. The spread of data centers across the U.S. is expected to increase electricity demand significantly, with AI searches using ten times more electricity than normal internet searches. Utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models, potentially compromising the reliability of the grid. Experts also note that rising natural gas prices, inflation, and the electrification of buildings and vehicles contribute to surging electricity prices, with potential budget cuts exacerbating the issue.</p>

          <p>Two Illinois-based toy companies are urging the Supreme Court to swiftly review the legality of President Trump's tariffs, citing the significant impact on businesses and consumers. The companies argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs. Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, described the tariffs as an “unbearable” tax increase and emphasized the separation of powers issues. The lawsuit is separate from another challenge to Trump’s tariffs that was filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, which permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff on virtually every U.S. trading partner.</p>

          <p>Channel smugglers are changing tactics, using 'taxi boats' to pick up migrants waiting in the sea off the French coast, making it more difficult for police to intervene. French police are struggling to halt a surge of people reaching the UK in small boats, with smugglers launching from hidden locations and cruising the coastline to collect paying customers. The French authorities focus on intercepting boats before they launch, but the smugglers are adapting quickly. An unintended consequence of the taxi boat system is that it gives young men an advantage over women and children, who often struggle to climb onboard from the sea.</p>

Charges were also filed against William Rubio, who allegedly threw fireworks at officers, and others accused of firing a laser pointer at a police helicopter and breaking into an Apple store.

          <p>A federal appeals court is weighing whether President Trump can continue deploying California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations, with judges appearing skeptical of the state's arguments against the deployment. The Justice Department argues that Trump's decision to call National Guard troops into federal service is unreviewable by courts, while California contends that the president circumvented Gov. Gavin Newsom and that the presence of troops would escalate tensions. The case involves whether the president exceeded his authority when he invoked Title 10 to call forth the California National Guard in response to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The new law will prevent women who terminate their pregnancy outside the current legal framework from being investigated by police, while still penalizing anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion outside the legal framework. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, was passed by a majority of 242 votes. The current law in England and Wales states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy and beyond that in certain circumstances.</p>
