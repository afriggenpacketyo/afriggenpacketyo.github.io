          <p>Shedeur Sanders, the former Colorado quarterback, was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. Sanders, who was projected to be a first or second-round pick, experienced an unexpected slide through the early rounds, making his eventual selection a major storyline of the draft. Despite multiple opportunities for other teams to draft him, Sanders remained available until the Browns picked him. Sanders expressed gratitude and excitement for the opportunity to play the game he loves, posting messages on social media after being drafted.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological sex. The guidance states that trans women should generally not be permitted in women's facilities in places like hospitals and shops, while emphasizing that trans people should not be left without any facilities. It clarifies that identifying as trans does not change a person's sex under the Equality Act, and provides examples of situations where trans individuals may be excluded from single-sex spaces based on reasonable objections. The EHRC plans to launch a consultation to seek feedback and update its code of practice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras and the mother of a one-year-old to Cuba, prompting legal challenges and accusations of violating due process.

The ACLU and other groups have condemned the deportations as a shocking abuse of power, while a federal judge has scheduled a hearing to investigate the deportation of the U.S. citizen. Trump has also expressed desire to deport violent criminals who are U.S. citizens to El Salvadoran prisons, raising concerns about constitutionality.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Iran has resulted in multiple fatalities and hundreds of injuries. The explosion, suspected to be a chemical blast, caused widespread damage, blowing out windows and roofs of nearby buildings.

While Iranian officials are investigating the incident, some analysts speculate that the fire may have been related to improperly handled solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles.</p>

          <p>A review of Charles Burnett's film "Killer of Sheep," which depicts the everyday lives of working-class Black families in Watts, Los Angeles in the 1970s. The film, now hitting theaters in a 4K restoration, presents a mood rather than a conventional narrative, focusing on the pain and resilience of its characters. The film features blues, R&B, and jazz on the soundtrack, serving as a fittingly soulful counterpoint to its critical portrait of inequality. "Killer of Sheep" shows us a part of that America, the invisible rendered visible, from sea to shining sea.</p>
