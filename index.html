          <p>Honda expects U.S. tariffs to significantly impact its financial performance, projecting a 650 billion yen decrease in profits for the fiscal year 2025. This announcement follows Honda's fourth-quarter earnings report, which revealed a 76% plunge in operating profit, underscoring the immediate financial strain caused by these tariffs. The company's revenue for the financial year ending in March reached 21.69 trillion yen, marking a 6.2% increase year-on-year, but operating profit fell 12.2% to 1.21 trillion yen, falling short of estimates. The report underscores the significant economic impact of trade policies on major international corporations.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's Vision Fund business reported a loss for the fiscal year ending in March, attributed to slowing gains in its tech investment arm. This comes after a surprise loss in the company's fiscal third quarter, raising concerns among investors about the performance of SoftBank's investment portfolio. Despite these losses, SoftBank remains focused on artificial intelligence, with significant investments in companies like OpenAI and Ampere Computing. The firm's strategic shift towards AI is further highlighted by its involvement in Stargate, a joint venture supporting AI infrastructure, demonstrating SoftBank's continued commitment to the sector despite recent financial setbacks.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life after multiple fires at properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation due to the high-profile nature of the case and the previous connections of the properties to Starmer. The fires occurred at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town and another property in Islington, with an earlier car fire also being investigated as part of the same inquiry. No one was injured in the incidents, and the Prime Minister has thanked the emergency services for their response, declining to comment further due to the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Addiction experts are warning Congress that proposed cuts to addiction funding will lead to more overdose deaths, pointing to the success of sustained financial investment in reducing overdose fatalities in 2024. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers highlights the potential for "dire consequences" if funding is slashed from key agencies like the CDC and SAMHSA. While fatal overdoses dropped by roughly 26 percent in 2024, experts fear that cutting funding will reverse this progress, particularly in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods, and disrupt research efforts tracking new synthetic street drugs.</p>

          <p>A recent Japanese government survey revealed that approximately half of respondents believed at least one instance of false information on social media, highlighting the growing problem of fake news and data. The survey, conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, examined belief in false claims, such as the idea that mass beaching of sardines signals an impending earthquake. The findings underscore the urgent need to improve media literacy among the public, as many are prone to believe unsourced information presented online, prompting the government to accelerate efforts in this area.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes following a temporary agreement between the United States and China to cut tariffs. This decision allows domestic carriers to resume accepting aircraft made in the U.S., reversing a situation where several jets were returned to the United States due to tariff disputes. The move is expected to positively impact Boeing, as China represents a significant portion of its commercial backlog, with plans for 50 jets to be delivered to Chinese carriers this year.</p>

The article suggests that while China's technological progress is impressive, it may not be enough to overcome its structural economic imbalances and cyclical pressures, highlighting the need for broader reforms to address unemployment, weak consumption, and reliance on exports.</p>

          <p>Following the recent trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates have been reduced, though triple-digit duties imposed since April have not been entirely eliminated. Chinese goods shipped to the US will be subject to a minimum of 30% in tariffs, while American exports will face a minimum of 10% in duties for the next 90 days. These rates do not include previous tariffs held over from Trump's first term, resulting in a baseline rate of about 50% for Chinese exporters, according to estimates from financial institutions.
