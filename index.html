          <p>Jack P Shepherd, known for his role as David Platt on Coronation Street, won Celebrity Big Brother 2025, beating finalists Danny Beard, JoJo Siwa, and Chris Hughes. The series gained attention when Mickey Rourke was removed for inappropriate behavior after accusations of homophobia from Siwa. Siwa also announced she identifies as queer instead of lesbian during the show, stating she was 'switching letters' in LGBTQ. The series finale included comedians Donna Preston and pop star Chesney Hawkes as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the arrests of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan and former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano for allegedly assisting immigrants who authorities claim were violent criminals. Judge Dugan is accused of obstructing an immigration arrest operation by misdirecting federal agents, while Judge Cano and his wife are charged with harboring an alleged gang member and destroying evidence. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers criticized President Trump's administration for undermining the judiciary, while Mayor Cavalier Johnson accused federal agents of showboating.

          <p>Joseph Koenig was found guilty of first-degree murder for throwing a rock that killed Alexa Bartell while she was driving. The jury also convicted him on multiple counts of attempted murder and assault, though some charges were downgraded. Two co-defendants, Nicholas Karol-Chik and Zachary Kwak, testified against Koenig, claiming he threw the fatal rock as part of their plea agreements. The defense argued that Koenig wasn't fully aware of the consequences of his actions, but the prosecution emphasized that adolescents are capable of impulse control and logical reasoning. Sentencing is scheduled for June 3.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to address the declining U.S. birth rate, which is near a record low. The declining birth rate poses long-term economic challenges, including a shrinking labor force and strain on resources for an aging population. Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried various strategies with limited success. Experts suggest tackling long-standing economic issues like affordable day care and paid parental leave might be more effective, as the U.S. is one of the few nations without paid parental leave.
