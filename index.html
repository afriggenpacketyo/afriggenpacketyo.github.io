          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a deal valued at £60 million, including add-ons. The 27-year-old, who began his youth career with Arsenal, chose to rejoin the club despite having also agreed to terms with rival Tottenham Hotspur. The move marks Arsenal's seventh signing of the summer transfer window. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Eze as a powerful and exciting player who will add a new dimension to the team's attack, highlighting his work ethic and mentality as key attributes that align with the club's values.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team delivered a commanding performance, defeating Wales with a record 30-point margin in their World Cup opening match. Despite recent off-field turmoil regarding player contracts, the Scottish team appeared united, scoring six tries in front of a record crowd in Salford. Francesca McGhie was named player of the match after scoring a hat-trick, leading her team to a decisive victory. The result was a significant disappointment for Wales, who were outmatched in nearly every aspect of the game and will need to regroup before their next match against Canada.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongfully deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, claim the government is attempting to coerce him into a guilty plea. They allege that after he was released from custody, immigration officials threatened to deport him to Uganda unless he accepted a plea deal that involved deportation to Costa Rica. This development occurred after Abrego Garcia refused to extend his jail stay as part of the proposed plea. His lawyers argue this constitutes an abuse of power to force a guilty plea by threatening rendition to a country where his safety could be at risk.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chairman's Signal of Potential Rate Cuts Boosts Non-Tech Stocks</h2>

          <p>Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium spurred a significant rally in the stock market, particularly benefiting non-tech, cyclical stocks. Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts, which investors interpreted as a positive sign for economically sensitive sectors, leading to gains in companies like DuPont and Home Depot. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new record high, the tech-heavy Nasdaq still posted a weekly loss, as major tech firms are seen as less dependent on borrowing costs and more on the artificial intelligence boom.

          <p>U.S. immigration officials have stated their intention to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Uganda after he declined a plea deal in his human smuggling case. The offer would have sent him to Costa Rica upon completion of his sentence, but he refused to extend his jail stay and was subsequently released to his family in Maryland. Shortly after his release, his attorneys were notified of the plan to deport him to Uganda, a move they describe as a vindictive response. This case has drawn significant attention since Ábrego García was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and later returned to the U.S. following a court order.</p>

          <p>The University of Colorado-Colorado Springs (UCCS) has found itself unexpectedly caught in the Trump administration's broader campaign targeting higher education, leading to a culture of fear and uncertainty on campus. An Associated Press review revealed that the university lost three major federal grants and is now under investigation by the Education Department over a diversity-focused scholarship program. In response, administrators have taken cautious measures, such as renaming websites, to avoid further scrutiny. This situation illustrates how the administration's policies, aimed at combating perceived liberal indoctrination, are affecting regional public universities far from the typical epicenters of political activism.</p>

The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanian-born philosopher who became the first African scholar to earn a European doctorate in the 18th century. Civil society groups, who had campaigned for the change for decades, celebrated the renaming as a significant step in decolonizing public spaces and acknowledging Black history.</p>

The event, which occurred early on August 10, sent a wave of water an estimated 1,400 feet up the opposite fjord wall, but fortunately, no tour boats or cruise ships were in the immediate vicinity at the time. Scientists believe the risk of such events is increasing as glaciers retreat due to climate change, potentially removing the supportive buttress of ice from steep mountainsides.

Dozens of other passengers were transported to multiple area hospitals with injuries ranging from stable to critical. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident but have ruled out mechanical failure and driver impairment, noting the driver is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted again on Hawaii's Big Island, shooting fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air. This marks the 31st such event since December, with the eruption contained entirely within the summit crater of Halemaumau, posing no threat to homes. The U.S. Geological Survey is providing live camera feeds of the spectacle, which has become a significant draw for visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that the frequent, episodic fountaining is caused by magma building up in a lower chamber before being forced to the surface.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple national postal services in Europe and India have announced the suspension of most merchandise shipments to the United States. The move is a response to a new U.S. policy, effective August 29, that subjects international goods previously exempt from tariffs to new import duties. Postal operators in Germany, Sweden, Italy, and India, among others, stated they lack clarity on the new rules and the technical readiness to collect the required tariffs. They are pausing services to avoid having packages caught in limbo, while mail and small gift items will largely remain unaffected for now.</p>

          <p>The world's leading authority on food crises has officially declared that famine is gripping Gaza's largest city, intensifying pressure on Israel to halt its military offensive. This rare determination comes as Israeli strikes on Saturday reportedly killed at least 25 people, including some sheltering in tents and seeking aid. For months, aid groups have warned that Israel's restrictions on food and the ongoing war are causing widespread starvation. Israel has denounced the famine declaration as false while continuing preparations for a large-scale operation in Gaza City, further complicating stalled ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a contentious Republican-backed redistricting bill, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott, who has promised to sign it into law. The legislation, which aims to redraw the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was the subject of a weekslong standoff after House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. The mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by President Trump to help secure a Republican majority in the House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have vowed to challenge the new map in court, arguing it dilutes minority voting power.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, who have been imprisoned for decades for the 1989 murders of their parents, were both denied parole in separate hearings this week. The parole boards cited the brothers' conduct in prison, rather than the original crimes, as the primary reason for the denials. Erik Menendez was noted for involvement in fights and a tax-fraud scam, while both brothers were cited for repeatedly using prohibited mobile phones. The commissioners acknowledged Lyle's remorse but stated that he still struggles with anti-social traits like deception and rule-breaking, which factored into the decision to keep him incarcerated.</p>

          <p>India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has launched a criminal case against industrialist Anil Ambani and his company, Reliance Communications, for alleged fraud. The case follows a complaint from the State Bank of India, which claims it suffered losses of approximately $344 million due to the company's actions. The CBI conducted searches at Ambani's residence and the offices of his now-insolvent firm in Mumbai. A spokesperson for Ambani stated that he strongly denies all allegations and will defend himself against the charges that bank funds were misused and diverted for unapproved purposes.</p>

          <p>An investigation by CBS News has found that users on Roblox, a massively popular online gaming platform, are able to bypass moderation systems to spread hate speech. In a popular game called "Spray Paint!," players were observed creating graffiti of swastikas and racist slurs targeting minority groups. While Roblox has automated and human moderation, players can evade filters by drawing messages instead of typing them in monitored chat boxes. With over 40% of its massive user base under the age of 13, the platform faces numerous lawsuits and growing scrutiny over its effectiveness in protecting young users from harmful content and predators.</p>

          <p>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has framed the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum not as a technological one, but as a philosophical decision about the future. He argues that Ethereum prioritizes speed and rapid development, making it agile for applications like DeFi and NFTs. In contrast, Dorsey describes Bitcoin as deliberately slower, prioritizing decentralization, stability, and security above all else, which he views as a feature, not a flaw. He poses the question of whether future generations would be better served by a system that is fast or one that is fundamentally secure and robust.</p>

          <p>A new FDA-approved technology called the Vivistim System is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The system involves a small implant that stimulates the vagus nerve during physical therapy, which is believed to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself and improve motor function. Ohio restaurateur Tommy Fello, who had lost movement in his left side after a stroke, became the first patient at the Cleveland Clinic to receive the implant and has since made significant progress. This first-of-its-kind technology is being hailed by medical experts as a major advancement in stroke rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Students and faculty are returning to U.S. universities for the new academic year to find institutions deeply affected by the Trump administration's campaign against higher education. The article details a widespread chilling effect, with universities facing funding cuts, crackdowns on student organizations, and new barriers for international students. The administration's actions, often framed as combating antisemitism or "woke indoctrination," have led to program closures, faculty dismissals, and a climate of fear that stifles academic freedom. Education advocates warn of an existential threat to the sector and anticipate a more politicized and potentially militant response from campus communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article from NPR explores the concept of "wardrobe diplomacy" through Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House. After a previous combative meeting where his casual, military-style shirt drew criticism, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt for his latest meeting with President Trump. This sartorial shift was interpreted as a deliberate message to engage in serious, high-stakes diplomacy rather than maintaining a pure wartime posture. The change in attire was noted positively by both President Trump and the press, potentially contributing to what Zelenskyy himself called his "best one" visit yet.</p>
