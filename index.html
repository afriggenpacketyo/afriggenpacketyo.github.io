          <p>A think tank in Taiwan organized a two-day war game involving retired US and Japanese generals to simulate the island's defense against a potential Chinese military attack. The Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation aims to identify critical defense issues and provide recommendations to the government through this exercise. The simulation, described as the first operational-level military simulation by a civilian institution, involves discussing the feasibility of Taiwan's military strategy in response to a possible Chinese invasion by 2030. High-profile participants include former US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen and former US Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair. The event seeks to bolster Taiwan's preparedness and strategic thinking in the face of growing regional tensions. Optimism regarding Taiwan's resilience and strategic planning is reflected in the event.</p>

          <p>Israeli authorities are deporting a group of activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were detained on a Gaza-bound aid boat. The yacht, carrying 12 people aiming to deliver humanitarian aid, was seized by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israel has dismissed the effort as a "selfie yacht" and stated the activists are being sent back to their home countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the vessel, stated that the campaigners are being processed and may be flown out of Tel Aviv. The boat, named Madleen, carried symbolic aid like rice and baby formula, intending to raise awareness about starvation conditions in Gaza. The action is part of Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza, which it claims is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas fighters. The interception and deportation highlight the complexities of delivering aid to Gaza amidst political tensions.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to prevent the sale of 23andMe's personal genetic data without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks court approval to acquire the struggling firm. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent from each individual. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield emphasized that customers should retain control over this deeply personal information. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals aims to purchase 23andMe for $256 million and has stated it will adhere to 23andMe's privacy policies. The legal action highlights concerns about the privacy and control of genetic data in the context of corporate acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves reversed her decision to cut winter fuel payments, restoring the payment to most pensioners, a move met with mixed reactions across the UK. While some papers celebrated the "victory for pensioners," others criticized the "humiliating U-turn" and questioned how it would be funded. The reversal occurred ahead of the government's Spending Review, where Reeves also pledged £14bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk. This investment aims to create 10,000 jobs and power six million homes, marking a significant step in the UK's energy strategy. The review also highlighted tensions over police funding, with the Home Secretary's request for more spending reportedly denied.</p>

Senior civil servants responded that while healthy challenge is encouraged, resignation is an honorable course for those with deep disagreements. The response has been met with frustration and disappointment among officials, who feel the space for challenging policy is shrinking.

The report highlights the prohibitive cost of parenthood and broader socioeconomic challenges impacting family planning. Dr. Natalia Kanem, head of UNFPA, emphasizes that many individuals feel unable to create the families they want, leading to a real crisis.

Hunt was convicted of capital murder during sexual abuse and burglary, receiving a death sentence in 1990. He admitted to the killing but denied sexually assaulting Lane, claiming he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Hunt's final appeal focused on alleged false statements made by prosecutors regarding evidence of sexual assault. Hunt has been on death row for over three decades, during which he has led a Bible class and expressed remorse for his actions.

The government insists nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030. Critics, however, argue the project is a costly mistake that will add to consumer bills, with the project expected to take at least a decade to complete.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have seen a significant decrease, with a 47% reduction in risk among those aged 20 to 29, according to data from the CDC. While fentanyl and other drugs killed over 31,000 people under 35 in 2021, that number dropped to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of naloxone, less potent fentanyl being sold, and increased addiction healthcare access. A study found deaths attributed entirely to fentanyl nearly quadrupled among people aged 15 to 24 from 2018 to 2022. The shift is also linked to less risky drug and alcohol use among teens and twenty-somethings. The Trump administration's potential cuts to science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis could jeopardize this progress.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops. US President Donald Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard members, later increasing the number to 4,000, triggering outrage from Democrats. Protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations. Demonstrations have included vehicles being set on fire, a major freeway being shut down, and reports of looting. California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued Trump, arguing the deployment is an illegal act. The situation highlights tensions over immigration policy and federal-state relations.</p>

          <p>A man in Texas has been charged with murder after allegedly slipping an abortion drug into his pregnant girlfriend's drink. Justin Anthony Banta was arrested following an investigation into his former girlfriend's accusation that he gave her the Plan C pill without her knowledge. The woman, who was six weeks pregnant, experienced heavy bleeding and lost her baby days later. Banta had allegedly offered to cover the cost of an abortion when she disclosed her pregnancy but she wanted to keep the baby. Police also charged Banta with tampering with physical evidence after discovering deleted information on his phone. The case highlights the restrictive abortion laws in Texas.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) will deploy school police to establish safe zones around campuses and school events to protect students and families from federal immigration agents. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced the plan amid widespread immigration raids in Los Angeles. The district aims to ensure students can enjoy graduation ceremonies and receive a free public education without threat. Carvalho stated that LAUSD would stand strongly on the right side of law and that every student has a right to counseling, social emotional support, and mental support. The move follows President Trump's reversal of a Biden administration policy that largely exempted schools from immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that certain psychiatric medications, such as anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, and antidepressants, may be associated with a slightly increased risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, led by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, found a 34%, 21%, and 26% increased risk, respectively, for the three drug types. While the increased risk is small, understanding these links could improve understanding of motor neurone disease and inform specialists prescribing treatments for psychiatric disorders. Researchers compared 1,057 ALS patients with over 5,000 controls, accounting for genetic and environmental factors. The study suggests further investigation into the connections between psychiatric conditions, their treatments, and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Signatories called for reversing terminated grants and allowing work with foreign collaborators. The NIH director, Jay Bhattacharya, acknowledged the letter and stated that respectful dissent in science is productive. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
