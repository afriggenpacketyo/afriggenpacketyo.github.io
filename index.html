          <p>Jake Wood, executive director of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, resigned just before the launch of a new Israeli-backed aid program in Gaza, stating that it was impossible to maintain humanitarian principles of neutrality and independence. Wood's resignation follows reports questioning the foundation's autonomy and connections with Israel. The foundation aims to distribute food to over one million Palestinians, but critics, including the UN, fear it will displace people and accelerate Israeli objectives. Despite Wood's departure, the foundation plans to proceed with operations, asserting its commitment to delivering aid and criticizing those who undermine the effort.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD experienced a significant drop of over 8% following the company's announcement of price reductions on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June. Analysts at Citi anticipate that these price cuts will lead to a substantial increase in dealership foot traffic, but they do not expect a major erosion of competitors' market share. Other Chinese automakers, including Geely, Great Wall Motor Co, Li Auto, and Xpeng, also saw declines in their shares as investors grew cautious about increased competition and potential price wars within the EV sector. Citi analysts remain optimistic about sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Octopus Energy has apologized to Peter Holden, a 67-year-old man from Hartlebury, Worcestershire, for relentlessly pursuing him for nearly four years over someone else's gas bill exceeding £6,000.

The issue stemmed from an industry data error that assigned the same serial number to Holden's meter and another unconnected account. Octopus Energy's commercial director personally apologized to Holden and committed to providing additional staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future, assuring him that his credit score was unaffected.</p>

          <p>Israeli air strikes across Gaza have reportedly killed at least 24 Palestinians, according to medics and Civil Defence officials. One strike hit the Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced families from Beit Lahia, resulting in 20 deaths including children. The Israeli military (IDF) stated the targeted area was a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields, though these claims are not independently verified. Another strike hit a home in central Gaza City, killing four more people, part of an escalated Israeli offensive in the northern part of the enclave.</p>

          <p>Businesses are utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. By using the initial sales price from the factory to the vendor, importers can strip out the cost associated with the middleman's profit, leading to potential cost savings. While the first sale rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention amid recent tariff regimes.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world’s first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, marking a significant effort to reduce reliance on imported seafood. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, built in Guangzhou, is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional offshore systems, this vessel can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and process salmon onboard, delivering fresh products to domestic markets quickly. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security.</p>
