          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, amidst controversy over his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Recent changes include disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books addressing race and gender issues from Naval Academy libraries. Critics, including former West Point faculty, argue these actions stifle education and debate. Trump previously dismissed military academy leadership, alleging the schools were infiltrated by leftist ideologies. Two protests were planned during the ceremony, highlighting the ongoing tensions surrounding these policy changes.</p>

          <p>Experts are undertaking a coral replanting effort in the Florida Keys, aiming to restore reefs decimated by climate change and disease. More than 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient and fast-growing species, have been transplanted to seven offshore sites. This initiative, involving partnerships between universities and environmental groups, hopes to find resistant strains that can thrive in warming waters. The project is part of a broader effort to restore various coral species and create a diverse and resilient reef ecosystem, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the ongoing decline of Florida's coral reefs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move that would end 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This proposal has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and improve the firms' operations. However, critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could increase mortgage rates and disrupt the housing market. The potential impact on homebuyers and the broader economy remains a key point of debate as the Trump administration evaluates the proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues discovered that the anatomy of these ancient fish scales is similar to that of vertebrate teeth. This suggests that the ability to sense pressure and temperature, which causes toothaches, evolved from the sensory capabilities of these ancient creatures. The finding sheds light on the evolutionary origins of our skeletons and explains why our teeth are sensitive to pain and temperature.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are delaying retirement planning due to current economic challenges. Rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures are taking precedence over long-term savings. The government's call for early retirement planning feels out of touch with the realities faced by many young workers. They are more focused on addressing immediate concerns than preparing for a distant and uncertain future.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate challenges from President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. Companies deploy AI tools to visualize global supply chains and understand how tariffs impact their operations. For example, Salesforce developed an import specialist AI agent that can instantly process tariff changes, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to assess products and materials. These systems allow firms to make faster, data-driven decisions on adjustments to their global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>
