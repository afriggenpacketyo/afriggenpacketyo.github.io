          <p>Former President Barack Obama spoke about the recent tragic deaths of Charlie Kirk and Minnesota lawmakers Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman, emphasizing the importance of disagreeing respectfully without resorting to violence. Obama stressed that these incidents highlight a larger issue of division in the U.S., criticizing leaders who use such events to further political agendas and sow discord. He praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox for demonstrating how to engage in public debate while respecting differing viewpoints. Obama reiterated his disagreement with Kirk's ideas but mourned his death, underscoring the need for honest discussions while upholding the right to express differing opinions. The optimism score reflects the somber tone of the article, focusing on tragedy and the need for unity.</p>

          <p>Former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee, claiming she was fired for refusing to pre-approve vaccine recommendations and dismiss career scientists. Monarez expressed concern that a newly formed vaccine advisory panel could restrict access to vaccines without rigorous scientific review. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disputed Monarez's account, stating she resigned due to trustworthiness issues, a claim Monarez denies. The controversy has sparked alarm over potential political interference in vaccine policy, raising questions about the integrity of scientific decision-making at the CDC.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a warning that assaulting its officers will result in federal felony assault charges, regardless of immigration status. This announcement follows DHS's expanded definition of threats, which includes filming ICE operations. Critics argue this broad language could lead to federal charges for actions typically classified as resisting arrest or protest activities. The message comes after DHS claimed a significant increase in attacks on ICE officers, though examples provided included minor incidents. The article's reflection of the agency's actions and potential implications contributes to the optimism score.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction, enacted through his "big beautiful bill," offers potential financial planning opportunities for workers who customarily receive tips. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in "qualified tips" per year from 2025 through 2028. However, experts advise against making any major financial moves until further guidance is released by the Treasury and IRS. The article suggests consulting with a tax professional or financial advisor to understand the law and its implications, as eligibility may depend on various factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A drone attack on Kyiv and the appearance of drones over Polish territory have highlighted the growing threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles. Drones are inexpensive, quickly manufactured, and difficult to detect, making defense against them a constant challenge.

Experts emphasize the need for layered defense systems, including RF interference, conventional munitions, and laser or microwave technology, to effectively counter the drone threat.
