          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates Amid Tariff Uncertainties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 16:25:10 EDT</div>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady, acknowledging the economic uncertainties caused by President Trump's tariffs. Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the impact of these tariffs on the economy is unclear, complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The central bank is grappling with the risk of both an economic slowdown and rising inflation due to the tariffs, creating a challenging environment for monetary policy. Trump has pressured the Fed to lower rates, but the central bank is hesitant due to the uncertain economic outlook.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates for the third consecutive meeting, citing heightened uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs. Officials are bracing for the tariffs to potentially fuel inflation and impede economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the difficulty in determining the appropriate policy response amidst these conflicting pressures. The central bank is wary of prematurely lowering rates due to persistent inflation risks, a lesson learned from underestimating inflation's duration in previous years.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressing concerns that budget cuts could negatively impact the Indian Health Service (IHS).

They urged the Secretary to ensure that IHS programs have adequate resources and staffing to fulfill their missions, and to engage in meaningful consultation with Tribal communities before making any further decisions affecting healthcare delivery.</p>

          <p>A House subcommittee hearing on transgender athletes devolved into shouting matches between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats arguing the hearing was a distraction from pressing issues.

The hearing underscored the deep divisions on the issue and the ongoing debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports.</p>

The foreign minister stated that such actions worry him greatly, as Denmark does not spy on friends.

          <p>Six individuals in Texas, including a county judge, two City Council members, and a former county election administrator, have been indicted on charges related to "vote harvesting" and tampering with evidence. Attorney General Ken Paxton's office conducted the investigation, alleging illegal activity during the 2024 election. The charges stem from a referral from a Republican district attorney and involve accusations of using CashApp to compensate individuals for collecting ballots.</p>
