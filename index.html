          <p>President Trump has condemned President Putin's killings in Ukraine, labeling his actions as "absolutely CRAZY" following a recent bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Despite this criticism, Trump has not joined European allies in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or offering additional aid to Ukraine. Experts suggest this pattern reflects Trump's tendency to withdraw from the conflict, followed by shock at Russia's escalating attacks and demands for Ukrainian surrender. Trump has previously hinted at considering sanctions but has ultimately refrained from implementing them, creating a strategic void that allows Russia's aggression to continue.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the imposition of 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, providing an opportunity for renewed trade negotiations. Both sides have expressed optimism, but significant obstacles remain, including differing priorities and unresolved demands. European negotiators are hesitant to agree to Trump's demands to change their consumption tax system and roll back digital regulations, while the US seeks to maintain current tariff levels. The EU is refining retaliatory tariff lists on American imports as a contingency measure, suggesting the path to a trade agreement remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>This article examines the history of electric vehicles, noting their early popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries before being overtaken by gasoline-powered cars. It draws parallels between the challenges faced by early EVs and the current political and economic landscape, where electric vehicle growth faces resistance. The article highlights how factors such as lack of infrastructure, gender stereotypes, and political opposition from the oil industry contributed to the decline of electric cars in the past. It also explores current efforts to promote EVs and the potential for technological advancements to overcome existing barriers, but policy uncertainty is mounting.</p>

          <p>Market analysts are urging investors to brace for continued volatility in the US-EU trade landscape, even after President Trump's decision to delay the imposition of 50% tariffs on European goods. The delay provides a window for negotiations, but disagreements persist and the potential for escalation remains significant. Experts suggest that the EU is unlikely to cave to Trump's negotiation tactics and will likely impose countermeasures if tariffs are implemented. Uncertainty about Trump's specific demands from Europe adds to the complexity, with sectors like tech and industrials particularly vulnerable to trade tensions. </p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany, along with France, the UK, and the US, has lifted range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine. This decision enables Ukraine to defend itself by attacking military positions in Russia. The Kremlin responded by calling the move "dangerous," while Merz reaffirmed Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine. While the previous German government refrained from sending long-range Taurus missiles, the new government has adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding weapon deliveries.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has dismissed Donald Trump's recent criticism of Vladimir Putin as an "emotional reaction" following Russia's intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine. Trump had labeled Putin "absolutely crazy" and accused him of needlessly killing people. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, attributed the comments to emotional overload. Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, stated that Ukraine's allies had removed range limits on supplied arms, potentially paving the way for Kyiv to strike military positions within Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump proposed redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the country.
