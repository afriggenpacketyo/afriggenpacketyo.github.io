          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the owner of the L.A. Dodgers, in a deal valued at $10 billion, making the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise globally. Jeanie Buss will remain as governor, representing the team in league matters, while Walter, also involved with the Professional Women's Hockey League, Los Angeles Sparks, Chelsea, and Cadillac Formula 1 racing team, will assume majority ownership. Magic Johnson, previously a part-owner, congratulated Jeanie Buss and praised Walter's accomplishments with the Dodgers. This comes after the Lakers acquired Luka Donƒçiƒá in a stunning trade, marking another significant event for the franchise. The team's record stands at 2236-1467 with 11 NBA titles since the Buss family's acquisition in 1979.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering military action against Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, with sources indicating he is becoming increasingly comfortable with the idea of multiple strikes on the facility. This consideration follows intelligence suggesting that Israel did not eliminate all Iranian air defenses as initially believed, raising additional security concerns. Trump is reportedly gauging the reaction of his base through Vice President JD Vance regarding potential American strikes. The President has been briefed on security vulnerabilities at U.S. Army bases, which could be targeted in retaliation. The lack of response from Iran regarding ongoing nuclear talks is attributed to Trump's demand for unconditional surrender.</p>

          <p>A 911 call from Scott Wolf's home in Park City, Utah, revealed a family dispute just days after the actor's divorce announcement. The caller, whose name was redacted, reported a fight and expressed feeling unsafe with Scott's brother, who was supposed to be helping with their children. The caller claimed abuse and individuals blocking her from entering the home, and also mentioned that Scott's brother had been removed for trespassing a few days prior. On the same day, Kelley Wolf, Scott's estranged wife, was detained by police in Utah County and taken to a hospital, accusing Scott of abuse in a video posted online. She claimed she was being further abused by the officers and insisted she knew what she was doing, while police stated they wanted to ensure she was okay after concerning comments to her father and others.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth avoided direct answers before Congress regarding potential U.S. military involvement against Iran, stating that the final decision rests with President Donald Trump. Hegseth declined to detail whether the options presented to Trump included the use of "bunker buster" bombs requested by Israel to disrupt Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. He emphasized his role is to provide the President with informed options and their potential ramifications. The prospect of American military intervention in the conflict raises concerns about shifting the balance of power in the Middle East and potentially conflicting with the views of Trump's political allies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly approved attack plans for Iran following a Situation Room meeting, but is awaiting to see if Iran will be willing to discuss ending their nuclear program. While the plans are ready, Trump has not made a final decision on U.S. involvement, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that all options remain on the table. Trump is considering various options, including strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, particularly the underground Fordo facility, which would require multiple strikes with American B-2 stealth bombers. He is also engaging with his base to gauge their reaction to potential bombing orders and has been briefed on the security of U.S. bases in case of retaliation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it is maintaining its benchmark interest rate, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach while evaluating the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to increase in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, consistent with its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and a growing economy but cautioned that new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disagreements over Iran's nuclear capabilities have created a rift between President Donald Trump and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, mirroring past debates during the Iraq War. While Gabbard maintains that U.S. intelligence agencies have determined Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, Trump insists Iran is "very close" to acquiring one. This divide reflects a broader conflict within Trump's "America First" movement regarding U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. Critics argue that exaggerating the threat of an Iranian bomb could lead to another disastrous military intervention, similar to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>

This disagreement highlights the limits of Trump's approach to appointments, where loyalty and shared grudges against intelligence agencies outweigh expertise. Gabbard's stance against American intervention aligns with her skepticism of intelligence implicating allies, while Trump seeks intelligence that supports his policy shifts.</p>

James Wong, a former CBP official, alleged Scott interfered with the investigation into Rojas' death by unlawfully obtaining medical records.

          <p>The home of slain Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband was burglarized overnight, just days after they were fatally shot. The home had been boarded up after the initial investigation, and family members had removed valuables. Police discovered that the plywood covering a rear window had been pried off, and the window broken to gain entry. While crime scene investigators searched the home again, family members said they don't believe anything was missing.</p>

Advocates like The Trevor Project criticized the decision, noting that the program has provided life-saving services to over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people.
