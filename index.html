          <p>Zoe Williams' article examines the complexities of protesting under authoritarian regimes, referencing Hannah Arendt's work.  While acknowledging the potential for authoritarians to exploit protests, the article contrasts the peaceful Women's Marches of 2017 with the violent response to the Ferguson protests. The recent Los Angeles protests, sparked by immigration raids, highlight the dilemma:  protesting risks government repression, but inaction allows injustice to prevail.</p>
