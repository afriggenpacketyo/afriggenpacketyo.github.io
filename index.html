          <p>Travelers across Europe are experiencing a second day of significant flight disruptions after a cyberattack targeted a widely used check-in and baggage system. Airports including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Dublin have been affected, forcing staff to resort to manual, paper-based check-ins and leading to long queues and hundreds of delays. The attack targeted the Muse software from Collins Aerospace, which allows multiple airlines to share airport infrastructure. While the company is working to resolve the issue, airports are advising passengers to expect continued delays and to check their flight status before traveling.</p>

Davey alleges that the platform is committing crimes by allowing harmful content, such as materials related to child abuse and self-harm, to remain accessible in breach of the Online Safety Act. The call for an investigation follows Musk's criticism of the act as a threat to free speech and his recent controversial remarks at a far-right rally.

          <p>The Women's Super League match between Aston Villa and Liverpool scheduled for Sunday has been postponed following the death of former Liverpool manager Matt Beard at age 47. Beard was a highly respected figure in women's football, having led Liverpool to consecutive WSL titles in 2013 and 2014. After rejoining the club in 2021, he successfully guided the team back to the top division.

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend." The message was reportedly sent just weeks after she had publicly condemned her association with him as a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the duchess explained that the email was sent in an effort to dissuade Epstein from suing her for defamation after her public comments. The spokesperson reiterated that the duchess abhors his crimes and stands by her public condemnation, stating she was taken in by his lies like many others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, writer Keith Magee reflects on the normalization of hate and prejudice in both the United States and the United Kingdom, drawing from personal experiences with racism. He argues that a growing "deficit of empathy" is corroding democratic societies, leading to political polarization and violence. Magee posits that empathy is not a weakness but a form of moral courage essential for public life, calling on leaders and citizens to reject divisive rhetoric. The article concludes with a plea to build a society where grace is prioritized over grievance to heal societal fractures.</p>

          <p>A large-scale funeral is set to be held in Glendale, Arizona, for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month. The memorial for the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA is expected to draw tens of thousands of supporters, with both President Trump and Vice President JD Vance scheduled to deliver remarks. Kirk's death has intensified the national conversation around political violence, with Republican leaders arguing the far-left is primarily to blame. His widow, Erika Kirk, was recently named the new CEO of Turning Point, vowing to continue his work.</p>

The proposed changes would allow military leader General Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, to run for president and would extend presidential terms from five to seven years. The vote is being boycotted by the main opposition parties, which have been suspended, leading to concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of the process.

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a covert, Russian-funded disinformation network attempting to interfere with the upcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova. Using an undercover reporter, the investigation found that the network promised payments to participants for posting pro-Russian propaganda and fake news designed to undermine the country's pro-EU ruling party. The operation, linked to fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, also involved conducting illegal polls to create a pretext for questioning the election results. This effort is seen as part of a broader Kremlin strategy to exert malign influence in the strategically significant Eastern European nation.</p>

          <p>More than a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in Nanyuki, Kenya, a local court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with her murder.

This legal development could lead to the first-ever extradition of a serving or former British soldier to face a murder trial abroad for the death of a civilian.

The service was held under a massive security presence, designated at a level comparable to the Super Bowl. The article frames the memorial within the context of a nation grappling with Kirk's killing, which prosecutors have labeled an act of political violence that has deepened fears of division.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Portugal are expected to formally announce their recognition of a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move aligning them with a growing number of Western nations. The announcements are anticipated ahead of the UN General Assembly, where the push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a key focus. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer had previously conditioned the move on Israel's failure to take substantive steps toward a ceasefire. This coordinated action is intended to increase pressure on Israel and keep the prospect of a peaceful, two-state resolution alive.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese film titled "731," which depicts the infamous Japanese military unit that conducted horrific human experiments during World War II, has become a major box office success in China. The movie's release coincides with the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat and comes at a time of deteriorating public perception between the two nations. While a commercial triumph, the film's focus on a dark and painful chapter of shared history has raised concerns that it could further exacerbate already frayed diplomatic relations between Beijing and Tokyo.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League leaders like Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic once associated with less sophisticated teams. This strategic shift is a response to the evolution of modern football, particularly the effectiveness of high-pressing defenses. By launching long passes from the goalkeeper, teams can bypass the opposition's press, minimize the risk of costly errors near their own goal, and exploit the physical strengths of forwards like Erling Haaland. This article analyzes how this tactical adaptation adds a layer of unpredictability and may be key to converting draws into wins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the potential consequences of more Western nations formally recognizing Palestine as a state, a move being considered by countries like the UK, France, and Canada. While critics argue the gesture is largely symbolic and performative without accompanying punitive measures against Israel, proponents believe it holds significant diplomatic weight. Recognition could upgrade Palestine's status in future negotiations from an "entity" to a state, strengthening its legal and political standing. However, the analysis also notes the risk of a defiant Israeli government responding with actions like formal annexation of West Bank territory.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are expressing support for the impending recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, France, and other nations, viewing it as a crucial affirmation of their rights. Despite the positive diplomatic signal, there is a widespread belief that Israel will respond by accelerating its annexation of West Bank land. The mayor of Jenin told the BBC that while he expects greater occupation, the recognition is vital for shaping the future and calling the international community to defend Palestinian rights.

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The move comes after Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging her to more aggressively investigate his political adversaries like former FBI Director James Comey and New York AG Letitia James. The previous U.S. Attorney for the district resigned after reportedly facing pressure to pursue a case against James without sufficient evidence. This appointment has raised concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice and its prosecutorial independence.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is gaining strength over open waters and is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm's center is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, but no watches or warnings are currently in effect for any land areas. While Gabrielle is predicted to remain at sea, distant swells generated by the system are expected to reach the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, early next week.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers indicates that the moon is more geologically active than previously believed, with evidence of recent landslides triggered by moonquakes. By analyzing before-and-after images, the team identified 41 new landslides that have formed since 2009. This discovery challenges the conventional wisdom that the moon's internal activity has mostly ceased. The findings have significant implications for future lunar missions, as the potential for seismic hazards must now be considered in the planning and construction of permanent scientific research stations or other infrastructure on the lunar surface.</p>
