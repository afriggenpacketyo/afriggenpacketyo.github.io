          <p>The US administration is reportedly considering wider sanctions against Russia in response to the escalating conflict in Ukraine, particularly after Russia launched its largest air bombardment of the war. President Trump has criticized Vladimir Putin's actions as "absolutely crazy" and stated that "all options are on the table," including sanctions. The European Union also intends to increase pressure on Moscow to encourage peace negotiations, with EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas describing Russia's recent air campaign as "totally appalling."

          <p>Kyodo News reports that Japan is allocating 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses amid inflation, while also protesting China's maritime research in its exclusive economic zone. Additionally, Japan is urging domestic universities to accept students affected by the U.S. ban on foreign students from Harvard University. The government is also addressing concerns over rising rice prices by releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, and investigating explosions at a Tokyo construction site that resulted in minor injuries and damaged buildings.

          <p>The White House is reportedly losing confidence in a Pentagon leak investigation led by Pete Hegseth, triggered by claims of an illegal warrantless NSA wiretap used to justify firing three top aides.

The investigation, centered on the leak of a classified document about US military plans for the Panama Canal, has resulted in internal strife and questions about the credibility of the evidence, leaving the White House skeptical of the Pentagon's handling of the matter.</p>

The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, alongside its child poverty strategy, with Phillipson leading the taskforce and stating that "nothing is off the table" regarding the cap.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to sever its longstanding business relationship with Harvard University by canceling all remaining federal contracts, estimated to be worth $100 million. A letter from the U.S. General Services Administration instructs federal agencies to find alternative vendors for future services previously provided by Harvard. The administration cites Harvard's alleged liberal bias, continued use of racial considerations in admissions, and allowance of antisemitic behavior on campus as reasons for the decision. Harvard is challenging these actions in federal court, arguing that the administration is infringing upon its First Amendment rights and attempting to control its personnel, curriculum, and enrollment.</p>

          <p>According to nuclear security analyst Ankit Panda, humanity is entering a new nuclear age characterized by heightened tensions between superpowers, China's emergence as a major nuclear power, the collapse of arms control treaties, and destabilizing technological developments. The recent conflict between India and Pakistan exemplifies the escalating risks, with India potentially no longer deterred by Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Panda argues that the US has played a critical role in global non-proliferation through its extended nuclear defense commitments, but a second Trump administration could cause allies to consider acquiring their own nuclear weapons, increasing the likelihood of global nuclear conflict.</p>

          <p>China, the worldâ€™s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in emissions even as energy demand increased, largely due to aggressive clean energy deployment. A Carbon Brief report indicates a 1% drop in overall greenhouse gas emissions, with increased wind, solar, and nuclear power outpacing electricity demand growth. This shift puts China ahead of schedule for its climate targets and marks a significant step toward meeting international climate goals. China's role as a major producer of clean energy technologies also benefits the global market, although concerns remain about emissions from other greenhouse gases and the potential for increased fossil fuel use.</p>

While some argue it's about nostalgia, others point to the manufacturing premium: higher wages, especially for non-college-educated workers, as detailed in a recent study. This research tracks workers moving between industries to isolate the causal effect of working in manufacturing, revealing a significant pay bump compared to sectors like retail and healthcare. High-end manufacturing, involving expensive machinery, offers the highest premium, while factors like unionization and the need for skilled labor contribute to these higher wages.</p>

          <p>After 35 years in the United States, neuroscientist Dan Yang, elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 2018, has returned to China to join the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART). The move allows Yang to reunite with her husband, Professor Mu-ming Poo, also a NAS member, who renounced his US citizenship in 2017 to lead research initiatives in Shanghai. The two scientists are the first NAS-member couple to repatriate to China, reflecting a growing trend of top-tier scientists being drawn to the nationâ€™s research ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Economic Shifts Contribute to Gender Divide in Political Views</h2>

          <p>A growing political divide between young men and women is attributed to economic shifts over the past half-century, particularly the decline in manufacturing jobs and the rise of the cognitive economy. Men without college degrees have experienced declining job prospects and social status, leading to lower social trust and more regressive gender norms. This economic crisis of masculinity, combined with the decline of traditional social roles, has contributed to a shift towards more right-wing political views among young men, while women have found empowerment and avenues for personal satisfaction through feminist messages and new opportunities.</p>
