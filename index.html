            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce and top trade negotiator, replacing Wang Shouwen, amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. This move comes as both countries have increased tariffs, with no immediate signs of renewed negotiations. Li's previous experience includes addressing concerns of private companies after President Xi Jinping expressed support for businesses. The appointment is part of a broader reshuffle in Beijing's top echelon, also including changes in the National Immigration Administration and the Foreign Ministry.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump for news agencies, particularly wire services like the Associated Press (AP). This policy change comes after a federal judge ruled that the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The new policy gives the press secretary greater control over who can question the President and limits wire service representation in pool coverage. The White House Correspondents Association has expressed concern that this policy could lead to viewpoint discrimination.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has faced allegations of violating court orders in several instances, raising concerns about the separation of powers. These clashes include the deportation of individuals despite court orders, the freezing of federal funding to states, and the removal of migrants to third countries. While no judge has held a member of the Trump administration in contempt of court, judges have expressed concerns about compliance. The administration defends its actions, arguing that federal officials have complied with lawful orders.</p>
