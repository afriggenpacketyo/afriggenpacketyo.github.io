          <p>The International Monetary Fund projects that increased U.S. tariff revenue will slightly reduce the country's fiscal deficit in 2025, despite a worsening outlook for U.S. growth and inflation due to the intensifying trade war. The projected deficit decrease is contingent on the magnitude of tariff revenue, which is subject to uncertainty based on consumer responses to higher prices and the evolving tariff schedule. The IMF also warns that tariffs could lead to a broader economic slowdown, potentially offsetting the revenue gains.</p>

Branson expressed concern over Trump's actions on Ukraine and the imposition of tariffs, which he believes undermine business. Despite these concerns, Virgin Atlantic is starting flights to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with Branson defending the decision by noting recent changes in the country.</p>
