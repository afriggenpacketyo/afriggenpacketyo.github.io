          <p>Cava's stock price plummeted over 20% after the company revised its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth downward. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain now anticipates growth of 4% to 6%, a reduction from the previous 6% to 8% range, citing a slowdown after the one-year anniversary of its popular grilled steak launch. While second-quarter earnings per share beat expectations, revenue and same-store sales fell short of Wall Street projections, reflecting a broader trend of slumping sales seen in rival chains.

          <p>California and the federal government are in a legal battle over President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles during protests. The state argues the move was an illegal violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement, and created a climate of fear. Federal lawyers maintain the deployment was legal under Title 10 to protect federal property and personnel during what the president termed a "rebellion." The trial has scrutinized the legal basis for the deployment, with the judge questioning the administration's claims.</p>

Protesters, mostly local residents, used humor and mockery on signs and balloons to express their disapproval of the vice president and the Trump administration's policies. The demonstration highlighted local anger over Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the administration's stance on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The protest, though small, gained significant attention on social media.</p>

          <p>Health experts are raising concerns that the federal government's decision to halt $500 million in funding for mRNA technology research will have far-reaching negative consequences beyond COVID vaccines. The versatile technology, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the body to create proteins, shows significant promise in developing treatments for diseases like pancreatic cancer, multiple sclerosis, and other rare genetic disorders. Critics have called the defunding decision reckless and politically motivated, warning that it could stifle progress in one of modern medicine's most promising fields and ultimately cost lives.</p>

          <p>Recent border clashes with Cambodia have significantly strengthened the Thai military's political power at the expense of the civilian government, raising concerns about the possibility of another coup. The conflict has allowed the military to operate with minimal oversight, while a political crisis has weakened the ruling Pheu Thai party and its prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra. With public trust in the military high and the civilian government in disarray, analysts suggest the conditions are becoming more favorable for a return to power by former junta leaders, even if a direct coup is not yet imminent.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing jumped 23% in the past week, reaching its highest level since April of the previous year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge was driven by a slight decrease in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate to 6.67% and a renewed interest in riskier adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which saw a 25% increase in applications. While homeowners are actively seeking to lower their payments, the lower rates did little to spur new home purchases, with purchase applications rising only 1%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing excavation of a mass grave in Chemmani, northern Sri Lanka, has so far unearthed 140 skeletons and has intensified the Tamil community's long-standing demand for international oversight in seeking justice for wartime disappearances. For decades, families have searched for relatives who vanished at the end of the country's civil war in 2009. Despite a new government, many victims' families and human rights advocates express deep distrust in domestic accountability processes, citing a history of intimidation and a lack of political will to prosecute those responsible for war crimes.</p>

          <p>A number of small towns across the United States are canceling popular and economically important Latino cultural festivals due to a pervasive "climate of fear" surrounding immigration enforcement. Organizers in towns from Virginia to Indiana cite concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents could target their events, deterring attendance and undermining the purpose of community celebration. The cancellations not only damage community relations but also have a significant economic impact on local authorities, vendors, and small immigrant-owned businesses that rely on the festivals for income.</p>

Similarly, Apple increased its U.S. investment commitment to $600 billion, a move seen as a successful bid to avoid tariffs on its products.

The scientists created an AI-driven system capable of arranging over 2,000 rubidium atoms, which act as qubits, into perfect patterns with unprecedented speed. This achievement overcomes a major obstacle for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a promising approach due to the stability and control of neutral atoms.

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, explores the mysterious disappearance of 17 children from a suburban town, with suspicion immediately falling on their unmarried teacher, Justine. This review in The Atlantic analyzes how the film taps into a long-standing cultural trope that portrays single women as unstable, dangerous, and a threat to the social order. As the community scapegoats Justine, she emerges as the film's unlikely hero, doggedly investigating the truth. The film is praised for balancing its grim social commentary with dark humor and a resilient central performance.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and armored vehicles have appeared on the streets of Washington D.C. after President Trump ordered their deployment and federalized the city's police force. The administration justified the move by citing "out of control" crime, a claim disputed by the city's own data which shows violent crime at a 30-year low. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, initially offered a diplomatic response but later condemned the deployment as an "authoritarian push."

Meltwater from Suicide Basin, a side basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier, has begun to escape, sending a surge of water into the Mendenhall River. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning, with the river expected to crest at a new record high, threatening hundreds of homes. This has become an annual event since 2011 due to a retreating glacier, a consequence of the warming climate.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of ancient whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, from a well-preserved 26-million-year-old skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast in Australia.

The species was named after Ross Dullard, the local resident who discovered the fossil while walking on the beach in 2019.

The review argues that the show's focus on neighborly relations and strong social ties feels like a comforting, almost fantastical ideal in today's politically fragmented America. While the show touches on modern annoyances, it largely avoids divisive culture-war topics, instead reaffirming its core message that belonging to a community is a worthwhile commitment. This focus on tolerance and mutual support makes the show's world feel both appealing and distant from reality.</p>
