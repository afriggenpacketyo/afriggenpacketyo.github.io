          <p>A senior Department of Justice official, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, conducted a six-hour interview with Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida. The meeting was reportedly initiated by Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking related to her association with Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyer stated that she answered all questions honestly and completely, marking the first time the government has formally questioned her since her conviction. This development occurs amid renewed public and political pressure for more information regarding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not over-investing in artificial intelligence, but are actually underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying massive capital expenditures, which are projected to reach a combined $320 billion in 2025. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased investment in cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests that spending is crucial for developing the most accurate and profitable AI, potentially leading to a near-monopoly for the victor.

          <p>Hunter Marquez, a 22-year-old top graduate from the Air Force Academy, has been denied a commission as a second lieutenant due to the administration's policy banning transgender individuals from military service. Despite meeting all physical and academic requirements, Marquez's dream of serving has been indefinitely postponed following a Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban. The article highlights the personal impact of the policy, contrasting it with expert opinions that argue such bans harm military readiness. Marquez remains hopeful for a policy reversal and is a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the ban.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with his testimony, former White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told House investigators that Hillary Clinton had expressed concerns about then-President Joe Biden's political viability for the 2024 election. Klain's voluntary interview was part of a House Oversight Committee probe into whether aides concealed signs of the former president's cognitive decline. While Klain reportedly maintained that Biden was mentally sharp enough to govern, he acknowledged that the president became more forgetful over time and that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also shared doubts about his effectiveness.</p>

          <p>This analytical article examines the reasons why the Biden administration did not release the complete set of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, despite political pressure. It explains that releasing such information, particularly secret grand jury testimony, is legally complex and requires exceptional court approval that is rarely granted. The government's primary role is to prosecute crimes, not to publicly release investigative materials that could violate privacy or compromise investigations. The article suggests that even if the Biden administration had wanted to release the files, it likely would have been blocked by the courts.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi is facing growing criticism from House Republicans over her department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. GOP members have expressed frustration that the Justice Department has not released more information, a move they see as a political fumble after years of stoking expectations among the base. The scrutiny intensified after reports that Bondi had informed President Trump his name appeared in the unreleased documents. With congressional subpoenas issued for the files and for Ghislaine Maxwell's testimony, the controversy is set to continue, creating a political crisis for the administration.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is launching a test of 10 new beverages in hundreds of its U.S. restaurants, aiming to attract younger customers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new lineup, which includes items like a Strawberry Watermelon Refresher and Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew, is inspired by its short-lived, beverage-focused spinoff chain, CosMc's. The company sees a significant opportunity in the growing demand for cold drinks, particularly as an afternoon snack or treat. This move is part of a broader strategy to boost sales and innovate its menu.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" on Republicans' chances in the 2026 midterm elections, predicting they will expand their majority in the House. He dismissed historical trends where the president's party typically loses seats, pointing instead to GOP opportunities in districts currently held by Democrats but won by President Trump. Johnson also defended the recently passed tax cut bill against low public approval, predicting voters will feel its economic benefits and "vote accordingly." He asserted that his predictions are based on hard work, not "groundless optimism."</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a 2018 incident. The judge, in her ruling, stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The high-profile case centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, had consented to subsequent sexual acts with the other four who entered the hotel room. The players' lawyers said the verdict was a relief after years of damage to their reputations.</p>

          <p>China is constructing a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Medog county, a remote and geopolitically sensitive area of Tibet near the disputed border with India. The project is not only intended to be a major source of hydropower but is also a key component of Beijing's strategy to develop the region and assert its control. The location in the Himalayan foothills makes the dam a strategic asset for both energy independence and border security.

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully grown the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing powerful laser weapons. The crystal, measuring 60mm in diameter, can efficiently convert lasers into frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere and can withstand immense power, far exceeding existing materials. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based lasers capable of disabling satellites in orbit. The development addresses a long-standing challenge in laser technology where weapons would often damage their own components due to intense energy levels.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to allow it to proceed with canceling hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. The grants in question, totaling roughly $783 million, were targeted for termination because they were linked to topics like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and gender identity research. A lower court had previously blocked the cuts, finding that the NIH engaged in "no reasoned decision-making." The administration is now asking the high court for an emergency stay to halt the lower court's order and proceed with the cancellations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit alleges that these policies obstruct federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals to federal custody. This action follows a recent high-profile shooting of a federal officer by an undocumented immigrant and reflects the Trump administration's ongoing pressure campaign against sanctuary jurisdictions. The city has defended its laws as necessary to build trust within immigrant communities.</p>
