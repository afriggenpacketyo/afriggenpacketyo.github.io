          <p>National Guard troops have been deployed to Memphis as part of President Trump's controversial federal taskforce, sparking legal challenges and debate over presidential authority. Similar deployments in Chicago were blocked, and a court ruling is awaited for Portland, Oregon, where the administration sought to deploy 200 troops. Tennessee's Republican governor supports the move despite local authorities not requesting federal assistance. Critics argue the President is overstepping his powers by deploying military personnel to cities run by political opponents, often by mischaracterizing protests as violent to justify the federalization of the Guard. This article highlights a significant test of federal-state power dynamics and the role of the National Guard in civilian law enforcement.</p>

Cohen highlighted instances where AI provided information for self-harm, emphasizing the urgent need to prevent teens from using these models for mental distress.

          <p>This article offers a critical analysis of Peter Thiel's recent off-the-record lectures on the Antichrist, suggesting they reveal more about the billionaire's personal preoccupations and relationship with power than about Armageddon itself. The author posits that Thiel, despite his disdain for academia, attempts a syncretic intellectual style reminiscent of his former professor, René Girard, often resulting in muddled arguments. The piece highlights Thiel's tendency to project his own Silicon Valley-centric worries onto global apocalyptic scenarios, identifying figures like Greta Thunberg and Bill Gates as "legionnaires of the Antichrist." Ultimately, the article questions the coherence and true meaning of Thiel's sprawling theological and political disquisitions.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel hosted a series of off-the-record lectures in San Francisco, philosophizing about the Antichrist and the coming Armageddon. Thiel, a self-described "small-o Orthodox Christian" and influential figure in Silicon Valley, believes that international agencies, environmentalism, and technology guardrails could hasten the Antichrist's rise. He equates the Antichrist with a "one-world state" and views figures like Greta Thunberg and Bill Gates as potentially dangerous. The article reveals Thiel's meandering and often confusing beliefs, drawing on diverse thinkers and pop culture, highlighting his deep-seated concerns about societal stagnation and the future of global governance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, accusing Beijing of "hostile" trade behavior. This threat follows China's expansion of export controls on rare earth elements, a move Trump claims will "clog markets" and harm global production. The President expressed surprise at China's actions, calling them "sinister and hostile," and warned that the U.S. possesses "much stronger" monopoly positions it has not yet utilized. This development signals a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two global powers, potentially jeopardizing diplomatic efforts at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has pledged universal free childcare for children aged nine months to four years if his party wins the next Welsh Parliament election. This "transformative" policy would offer at least 20 hours for 48 weeks a year by 2031, providing substantial financial relief to families. Ap Iorwerth positioned Plaid Cymru as ready to replace Labour, which has dominated Welsh politics, and urged voters to back his party against Reform UK. The plan, estimated to cost an additional £500 million annually, aims to be the most generous childcare offer in the UK, funded from the Welsh government's existing budget.</p>

Farage testified that the video was "pretty chilling" and genuinely worried him. Despite Khan's defense that his actions were merely "attention-seeking" and part of his online persona, the jury at Southwark Crown Court returned a guilty verdict.

          <p>Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive their monthly checks, as these payments are covered by mandatory, permanently approved spending. However, other Social Security Administration (SSA) services, such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacement Medicare cards, may be temporarily halted due to furloughed staff. Approximately 90% of SSA's workforce is deemed essential and will continue working without immediate pay. This article clarifies that while core payments are secure, the shutdown could still cause significant inconvenience and delays for beneficiaries needing administrative assistance.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. This indictment follows public calls from President Donald Trump for charges against James, a long-standing political antagonist who previously sued him for business fraud. The charges, presented by a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, allege James made false statements on a mortgage application for a Virginia home. James vehemently denies the "baseless" charges, calling them a "continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system" and asserting her office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, members of Congress will continue to receive their annual salaries, unlike hundreds of thousands of federal employees who face delayed pay or furloughs. This is due to a constitutional provision that permanently appropriates lawmakers' pay, meaning their funding does not require annual renewal. Most members earn $174,000 annually, a rate unchanged since 2009. While congressional staffers' pay will be delayed, the guaranteed income for legislators highlights a notable distinction in how different branches of government are affected by funding impasses, drawing public scrutiny during times of federal closure.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of the 14 U.S. government shutdowns that have occurred since 1980, with the most recent beginning on Wednesday. It explains that shutdowns happen when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies, a practice that changed after legal opinions in the early 1980s prohibited agencies from operating without appropriations. The piece details various past shutdowns, including eight under President Reagan and two significant ones under President Clinton, often stemming from disputes over spending cuts, specific programs, or policy priorities. The article highlights the increasing frequency of such impasses and their economic costs, with the 2018 shutdown costing $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>
