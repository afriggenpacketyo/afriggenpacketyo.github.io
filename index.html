          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California for illegally exporting sensitive AI chips, including Nvidia's advanced H100 models, to China. The individuals allegedly operated a company to smuggle tens of millions of dollars worth of technology without the required licenses, violating U.S. export controls established in 2022. Law enforcement uncovered communications detailing plans to evade these laws by transshipping the components through countries like Malaysia. This case highlights ongoing U.S. efforts to prevent its most advanced semiconductor technology from reaching China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that the Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most significant annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly four decades ago. The northern and southern regions experienced the most extensive coral bleaching ever recorded, primarily driven by climate change-induced heat stress, alongside impacts from cyclones and starfish. This unprecedented damage, which for the first time occurred simultaneously with bleaching at Australia's second-largest reef, raises concerns that the ecosystem is approaching a critical tipping point from which it may not recover.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams receiver Davante Adams has voiced concerns about Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter playing significant snaps on both offense and defense. While acknowledging Hunter's athletic talent, Adams predicted that the demanding workload would double his risk of injury and potentially shorten his NFL career. He specifically questioned how Hunter's frame would hold up when tackling larger players in the league. The Jaguars have listed Hunter, a former two-way college star, as a starting wide receiver and backup cornerback on their initial depth chart, signaling their intent to utilize his versatility.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's move to unseal grand jury testimony related to her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights while her conviction appeal is pending before the Supreme Court. The filing emphasizes that Maxwell is alive and her legal options are still viable, unlike the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, making the public's interest insufficient to justify breaching grand jury secrecy. The defense also noted they have not been allowed to review the transcripts, which they describe as containing untested, hearsay-laden statements presented without adversarial challenge.</p>

          <p>Economists in China are currently debating the merits of establishing official consumption benchmarks, similar to the country's GDP growth targets, for the next five-year plan. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a goal for the household consumption rate—which stood at a low 39.6% in 2023—is a crucial national strategy to bolster domestic demand. However, other influential thinkers express skepticism, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as effective policy goals. The discussion reflects ongoing efforts within Beijing to rebalance the economy by encouraging more consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

Over 1,900 personnel are battling the flames, but efforts are being challenged by steep, inaccessible terrain and an impending heatwave expected to worsen fire conditions. Evacuation orders are active in several areas as the fire continues to burn out of control.</p>

Kennedy stated that HHS has determined the technology "poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses," a move that infectious disease experts have sharply criticized as unscientific and dangerous. Critics argue the decision undermines pandemic preparedness, as mRNA technology allows for the rapid development of vaccines crucial for responding to new and mutating viruses.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan to ensure only state institutions possess weapons by the end of the year, a move aimed at disarming the militant group Hezbollah.

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that the states demonstrated a likelihood of "irreparable harm" if the funds were repurposed, as it would halt hundreds of approved projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters.

Abbott's legal action argues that the lawmakers' refusal to return constitutes an abandonment of their duties and justifies their removal.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is set to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as other quarterbacks on the roster, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, are dealing with hamstring injuries, and veteran Joe Flacco is not expected to play much in the preseason. Sanders, who was drafted in the fifth round after a prolific college career under his father, Deion Sanders, was surprisingly listed as fourth on the depth chart just a day earlier. This start provides him a significant opportunity to compete for a roster spot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable, attributing the tragedy to significant negligence by OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush and a "toxic" corporate culture. The comprehensive report details how the company used intimidation tactics to silence safety concerns and exploited regulatory loopholes to operate outside established deep-sea protocols. Key failures included the submersible's inadequate design, which used carbon fiber instead of steel, and the continued operation of the vessel despite known damage and warnings from employees, leading to the deaths of five people.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting a rise in flea-borne typhus infections, particularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The disease is spread to humans through the feces of infected fleas, which often live on rats, opossums, and stray cats. So far this year, Los Angeles County has reported 79 cases, while the city of Long Beach has seen a significant jump to 20 cases. Officials are advising residents to protect themselves and their pets by using flea control medicine, securing trash, and avoiding contact with stray animals to prevent further spread of the illness.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced they will not pursue the death penalty against three high-profile accused Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is charged with running a powerful faction of the Sinaloa cartel. The decision is notable given the Trump administration's support for capital punishment for major drug traffickers. Typically, Mexico extradites its citizens on the condition they will not face the death penalty, but these cases involved unusual circumstances.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates, Chemours and Corteva, to resolve claims related to pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. State officials called it the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund the cleanup of four industrial sites across New Jersey. It also establishes a substantial reserve fund to protect taxpayers if the companies fail to meet their obligations.

Over 1,200 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are battling the flames amid unfavorable weather conditions, including strong winds in one of the region's driest areas.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis has found that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. The investigation, based on Ukrainian Air Force data, shows a sharp escalation in aerial bombardments, reaching the highest levels of the war. This increase has occurred even as the Trump administration twice paused deliveries of critical air defense munitions to Ukraine. Critics suggest these pauses and the administration's broader approach may have emboldened Russia to intensify its assault on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.</p>

Executives attributed the weak outlook to a deteriorating housing market with high mortgage rates suppressing buyer demand.

          <p>New research based on 20 years of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park indicates that social bonds between female mountain gorillas are more crucial than previously thought. The study found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she actively seeks out and joins other females she already knows, even if they have been apart for many years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex relationships in gorilla society, as having an ally can provide significant social benefits and help a newcomer navigate the group's hierarchy. The findings shed light on the evolutionary roots of social movement.</p>

          <p>One of the UK's largest debt advisory services, Money Wellness, is urging the government to introduce a statutory grant system in England to help low-income families with the high cost of school uniforms. Unlike Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, where grants are standard, support in England is a "postcode lottery," with only about one-fifth of councils offering dedicated help. With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary and £454 for secondary students, many families face significant financial burdens.
