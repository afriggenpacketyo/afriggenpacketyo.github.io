          <p>Republicans are facing accusations of hypocrisy as they rush President Trump's legislative agenda through Congress, employing tactics they previously criticized Democrats for using during the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The article highlights the GOP's haste in approving the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," mirroring past Democratic actions, such as scheduling pivotal hearings in the early morning hours and limiting review time for lawmakers. Critics like Representative Chip Roy acknowledge the rushed process, yet ultimately voted for the bill. The article draws parallels to past instances where Republicans have used alleged Democratic transgressions as justification for expanding presidential power.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes in the area.

          <p>President Trump is considering taking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman. This would end 17 years of federal control over the entities that guarantee trillions of dollars in mortgages. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn this could benefit investors at the expense of homebuyers. The White House states that any actions will be carefully evaluated to strengthen the Federal Housing Finance Agency and promote homeownership. The article explains the history and function of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the potential implications of privatization.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article accuses broadcast networks of bias in their coverage of political books, favoring "tell-all" books about Trump while downplaying those about Biden. The article contrasts the extensive coverage given to anti-Trump books like Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged" with the limited attention paid to a new Biden "tell-all" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. The author asserts that networks aggressively pushed the White House line that questioning Biden‚Äôs fitness was a MAGA talking point, neglecting to press the issue of media spin.</p>

Cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition and performed open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis and remove the thickened pericardium. Mauceri recovered and returned to conducting, expressing gratitude for the medical team's intervention. He now feels like he is in the best shape since college.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article criticizes Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s reliance on questionable scientific reports to justify policy decisions, particularly regarding vaccine safety and the drug mifepristone. Kennedy cited a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center to call for an FDA safety review of mifepristone, despite the report's flawed methodology and lack of peer review. The article raises concerns about the politicization of scientific research and the potential for biased decision-making within the FDA. It underscores the importance of rigorous scientific standards in evaluating drug safety.</p>

          <p>Fifa president Gianni Infantino hinted that Cristiano Ronaldo could potentially play in the 2025 Club World Cup, despite his club Al-Nassr not qualifying for the tournament. Infantino mentioned discussions with clubs about potentially hiring Ronaldo for the event. With Ronaldo's contract expiring in June, this opens the possibility for him to join another team specifically for the Club World Cup. The tournament is expanding to 32 teams and will be played in the summer, requiring Fifa to introduce an additional transfer window.</p>

The MPs are pushing for a different approach to address the "black hole" in public finances, including restoring the top tax rate and increasing capital gains tax.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax and spending plans, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," are facing growing skepticism from Wall Street investors. Concerns center on the US's "twin deficit" position and the potential for Trump's policies to stoke inflation and lead to recession. Moody's recently stripped the US of its top-notch credit rating, reflecting the unease. The measures, including extending tax cuts and controversial spending cuts, are projected to increase the US's annual deficits significantly. Investors are warning that patience is running out as Trump's policies challenge the consensus that US assets are the safest investment.</p>

          <p>While the "defund the police" movement faced backlash, some cities are seeing progress in public safety through alternative approaches. Milwaukee redirected police funding to affordable housing and youth programming, while Seattle invested in participatory budgeting and launched a third public safety department focused on mental health crises. Austin increased investment in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. Organizers say these efforts have sparked conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety, despite challenges and shifting public sentiment. They hope the Trump administration's emphasis on law enforcement will inspire renewed interest in alternatives to policing.</p>

          <p>Current and former state department officials are expressing concerns that the Trump administration is minimizing the threat from white supremacists. The administration has banned the term "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism" and is cutting resources from offices that address the threat. This follows a pattern of moving resources away from programs focused on the far right since Trump took office. Critics suspect the administration is prioritizing threats that align with Trump's base while deprioritizing the far right, which they see as a politicized smokescreen.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week of remote work. This is above the international average of 1.3 days. Hybrid working has become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. The popularity of home working in the UK is attributed to the cost and length of commuting. Despite some companies implementing return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized since 2023. A separate poll found that less than half of workers would comply with a full-time return to the office.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing to pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which would make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting wealthy Americans. The bill is criticized for cutting taxes for the wealthiest while reducing key government assistance programs for low-income individuals. Democrats denounce the bill as a cruel scheme that will harm working-class families. To offset the expense of the tax cuts, Republicans are proposing stricter work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP, as well as ending clean energy tax credits. Economists say the tax cuts have done little to help the middle class.</p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's claims that Doge did not cut Aids programs, global health officials report widespread and disastrous effects from the White House's throttling of foreign aid. These disruptions have caused new HIV infections to surge and threaten plans to eradicate the virus as a public health threat by 2030. The cuts have created uncertainty around the rollout of Lenacapivir, a new drug hailed as "the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in HIV response."

          <p>The death of 4,000 chicks in the mail highlights the often-hidden realities of animal transportation in the meat industry. Animals are frequently transported multiple times throughout their lives and are often treated like cargo rather than living beings. Mass-casualty events during mail-order and transportation of farmed animals are rare but expose the industry's systemic issues. The poultry industry doesn't publish statistics on animal deaths during transport, but it's estimated that millions die painfully each year, and virtually no companies are held accountable. The meat industry could improve animal welfare during transport but often prioritizes profits over animal welfare.</p>

Staff members wear bear costumes to prevent the cub from forming bonds with humans, ensuring its eventual return to the wild. The cub, found underweight and weak, requires four enrichment and feeding sessions daily. The wildlife center hopes to release the cub back into the wild after a year of care, potentially pairing it with another cub to minimize human imprinting.</p>
