          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties. Optimism regarding trade relations may be tempered by the administration's swift appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Araceli, a Salvadorian immigrant, along with her partner and two daughters, faced a challenging journey to enter Canada, requiring three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge. They were fleeing the threat of US President Donald Trump's mass deportations, but encountered obstacles due to the "safe third country agreement." This agreement stipulates that asylum seekers must apply for asylum in the first country they land in, with exceptions for those with close relatives in Canada. Despite initial setbacks and spending 14 days in a US detention cell, the family eventually succeeded with the help of an attorney. The number of asylum seekers being denied entry into Canada from the US has increased, reflecting stricter border policies.</p>

          <p>China's most powerful destroyer, the Type 055, has extended its strike range by integrating with an airborne early warning system, according to CCTV. This allows the destroyer to engage targets beyond visual range with precision, similar to technology used by the Pakistan Air Force. The Lhasa destroyer participated in a live-fire exercise, using data links to synchronize with airborne platforms, enabling long-range anti-ship and air-defense strikes. This networked capability represents a major advance in operational coordination, ensuring complete interoperability and seamless information sharing across domains, according to military commentator Song Zhongping.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) has cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, the lowest level since August 2022, marking the fourth cut in the last six meetings. This decision comes as South Korea grapples with political uncertainty following a botched attempt by the former leader to impose martial law and the imposition of 25% reciprocal tariffs by the Trump administration. The BOK attributed the rate cut to expectations of declining economic growth and stable inflation. The central bank also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%, considerably lower than the previous projection of 1.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a key element of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. Implementing tariffs typically requires congressional approval, which Trump bypassed by declaring a national economic emergency. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses.

However, the reservoirs could still be more than a decade away from opening. Scientists warn that household consumption of water may also need to decrease to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population.

The resurgence is due to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which translocated 28 juveniles and 15 sub-adult golden eagles from the Scottish Highlands. These eagles have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution.

          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago street gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted of federal charges in 1997 and sentenced to six life terms, in addition to a 200-year sentence on state charges for a 1973 murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement. The lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial expressed disappointment, emphasizing Hoover's ruthless efficiency in running a criminal enterprise from prison. It's unclear when he will be released from federal custody, but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois.</p>

Immigration authorities made contact with O.C.G.’s legal team and were working to bring him back to the United States on a charter flight.

Judge Michael Farbiarz wrote that the government’s justification for removing Khalil, that his beliefs may pose a threat to US foreign policy, could lead to arbitrary enforcement. However, the judge stopped short of ordering Khalil's release, citing concerns about undisclosed personal details in his residency application. Khalil was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 and has been held for nearly 12 weeks. The ruling marked the first time a federal judge had weighed in on the constitutionality of Trump’s use of a law granting the US secretary of state the power to seek the deportation of any non-citizen deemed adverse to US foreign policy interests.</p>

          <p>Rubén Blades delivered another memorable concert in Los Angeles, offering a wide-ranging set of classics and new songs despite time constraints and venue restrictions. The Panamanian maestro has a vast repertoire, but his shows are limited by time and his tendency to engage in lengthy monologues. The Peacock Theater was not full, and security was strict, preventing people from dancing. The concert included new songs from his album “Fotografías,” addressing themes of urgent actuality. Despite these challenges, Blades displayed remarkable vocal power and versatility, supported by the masterful Roberto Delgado & Orquesta.</p>
