          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member appearing to say "The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP." The group stated they did not intend to incite violence and condemned the exploitation of the footage. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution and the Prime Minister's spokesperson said such views should not receive government funding. Kneecap previously won a discrimination case against the UK government after arts funding was withdrawn, receiving Â£14,250.</p>

          <p>China is developing an extensive underwater network, dubbed the "Underwater BeiDou," to enhance navigation, provide real-time environmental monitoring, and potentially track submarines and drones. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Natural Resources, the network will consist of surface buoys, submerged buoys, and seabed platforms. Surface buoys, equipped with satellite receivers, will transmit real-time data via encrypted links, while mid-depth submerged buoys will track water currents and salinity shifts. Large-scale prototypes have already been built and tested, marking a significant step in expanding China's maritime influence.</p>

          <p>The football model popularized by Pep Guardiola, which emphasizes positional play, is shaping the present and future of the game, with three of his disciples reaching the Champions League semi-finals. While critics argue that this model can stifle spontaneity, five of the eight quarter-finalists in the Champions League this season played a version of positional football. Clubs are increasingly hiring managers who believe in this approach, and academies are training players to fit this style.

          <p>Deliveroo, once hailed as a promising British technology pioneer, is preparing to exit the stock market through a takeover bid from DoorDash, marking a significant failure of its time as a publicly traded company. Investors who bought shares during its initial public offering have seen their investments significantly eroded. The company's struggles highlight a broader issue of over-hyped and ultimately disappointing companies listing on the London Stock Exchange. The board's decision to accept a low-ball offer reflects the challenges Deliveroo faced after a disastrous stint on the public markets.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a Small Pots Data Platform to consolidate pension pots worth less than Â£1,000, aiming to simplify pension management. This platform, alongside the Pension Dashboard, could transform retirement planning by providing a comprehensive view of pension wealth. Experts suggest expanding the platform to facilitate a Lifetime Pot model, where individuals choose a provider and maintain a single pension throughout their career. Currently, individuals can track their pensions by contacting the Governmentâs Pension Tracing Service and consolidating their pots, but should be wary of exit fees and lost benefits.

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's initial promise to end the war between Russia and Ukraine in "one day," achieving a ceasefire agreement has proven more difficult than anticipated. While the Trump administration has initiated discussions with both Russia and Ukraine, progress has been limited, with both sides accusing each other of sabotaging ceasefire efforts. The U.S. has threatened to withdraw from negotiations if no compromise is reached. The coming week is considered critical for determining the future of the ceasefire talks.</p>

When Parliament returns, it's possible we see the Liberals quickly introduce legislation focused on securing Canada's economy in the face of US tariff headwinds.</p>

Potential challenges include the economic impact of tariffs, a constitutional crisis arising from immigration policies, and the influence of Elon Musk's "DOGE" initiatives. The article notes the tension between Trump's message of standing up to countries that have taken advantage of the US and the potential for economic recession.</p>
