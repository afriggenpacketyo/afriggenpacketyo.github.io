          <p>The Department of Justice has fired more than 35 employees who were involved in investigations into former President Trump, including the classified documents case and the January 6th Capitol riot probes. The dismissals were directed by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review law enforcement policies and prosecutions from the previous administration. A fired public affairs specialist warned that the separation between the White House and the DOJ has been erased, suggesting a continuing wave of politically motivated retribution within the agency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. The move is part of a broader effort to create a more "reciprocal" global trade landscape, with similar letters being sent to numerous other U.S. trading partners. President Trump warned that any retaliatory tariffs from the EU or Mexico would be added on top of the 30% rate, escalating potential trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions flared at the end of day three of the Test match between England and India at Lord's over alleged time-wasting tactics. England's Zak Crawley delayed the game to ensure he only faced one over before the close, prompting an angry reaction from India's captain, Shubman Gill. England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed the complaints, pointing to India's own delays earlier in the match, including Gill receiving a massage on the field. The incident added a dramatic finish to the day's play.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's renewed tariff campaign, including a 30% levy on EU and Mexico imports, the stock market has remained near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics and are focusing on other positive economic drivers, such as deregulation and advancements in artificial intelligence. This market stability contrasts with the panic seen during previous tariff announcements, indicating a shift in investor sentiment and a focus on long-term corporate earnings potential.

          <p>During a visit to flood-stricken Texas, President Donald Trump responded to a reporter's question about families upset over late emergency alerts by calling the inquiry "evil." The reporter asked what he would say to families who believe lives could have been saved with more timely warnings. Trump deflected the question, praised the official response as "heroism," and asserted that only a "bad person" would ask such a question. The exchange has gone viral online, drawing widespread criticism for its perceived lack of empathy.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are initiating a legal challenge against the government, arguing that its current guidance on smartphones in schools is unlawful and fails to protect children. The campaigners, who have formally warned the Education Secretary of their intent to seek a judicial review, are calling for a complete ban on smartphones in schools. They cite rising incidents of cyberbullying and access to harmful content as evidence that headteachers' discretion is not enough. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people reveals a baffling cockpit event. Just seconds after takeoff, both fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he "did the cut-off," with the other denying he had done so. While the switches were quickly reset, the Boeing 787 lost power and crashed, leaving investigators to determine if the act was intentional, accidental, or a system malfunction.</p>
