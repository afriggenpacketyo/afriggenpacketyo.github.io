          <p>The US has imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods due to India's continued oil trade with Russia, but India's government and markets show little panic. Officials view the move as a pressure tactic, with political consensus in India strengthening the government's resolve to resist US demands, particularly those affecting farmers. While the economic impact could be significant for sectors like gems, seafood, and textiles, India's reliance on domestic consumption provides a buffer. India is pursuing diplomatic channels with Russia and China while also making some concessions to the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its main interest rate by a quarter-point, from 4.25% to 4.0%, continuing its cautious approach to monetary policy. The decision was made by a slim 5-4 majority on the Monetary Policy Committee, reflecting differing views on how to manage the economy. Policymakers are balancing persistent inflation, which rose unexpectedly in June, against signs of a cooling labor market and economic contraction. The bank signaled that future rate cuts will be gradual and dependent on the easing of underlying inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly has raised its 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by surging demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for the fiscal year. However, the announcement was tempered by disappointing late-stage trial results for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which caused a significant drop in its premarket share price.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the detentions are underway and stated the government is prepared to defend the policy against legal challenges. The 11-month pilot program is a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's strategy to control illegal immigration across the Channel.</p>

The government took control of the plant in April to prevent its closure and is now seeking a new commercial buyer. However, the search has stalled due to Jingye's financial demands, which starkly contrast with the government's view that the loss-making company is essentially worthless. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is expected to join the high-stakes talks in September to resolve the impasse.</p>

In a letter to the Air Force secretary, senators expressed concern that diverting funds could further delay the already over-budget nuclear modernization program.

          <p>This article explores the cultural and political history of survivalism, tracing its roots from fictional works to real-world movements. It distinguishes between the "survivor," who seeks to rejoin civilization, and the "survivalist," who often desires its collapse, analyzing how this mentality is portrayed in literature like "Lord of the Flies." The piece examines the evolution of the term from the far-right connotations of the 1970s and 80s to the modern "prepper" movement. It contrasts the common fictional theme of individualistic violence with real-world disaster studies showing that cooperation and mutual aid are more common human responses.</p>

          <p>Several prominent U.S. universities, including Columbia, Penn, and Brown, have agreed to multi-million dollar settlements and policy changes to resolve antisemitism claims brought by the Trump administration. In exchange for restoring federal funding, the universities have adopted measures that critics warn undermine their autonomy and academic freedom, such as allowing government oversight of curriculum. Education advocates express concern that these settlements create a precedent, emboldening the administration to use federal funds as leverage to enforce ideological conformity on other institutions. The deals are part of a broader campaign by the administration to reshape higher education.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) following the release of a jobs report that was significantly weaker than expected. The July report showed modest job growth and included major downward revisions for the previous two months, altering the narrative of a resilient economy. Trump called the data "a scam" and ordered the dismissal of the commissioner, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from economists. Experts worry that firing the head of an independent statistical agency undermines the credibility of U.S. economic data, which is crucial for business decisions and Federal Reserve policy.</p>

          <h2>New Federal Student Loan Limits Raise Concerns for Aspiring Medical Professionals</h2>

          <p>A new provision in recent federal legislation capping lifetime graduate school loans is causing concern among medical professionals and students. The law limits borrowing to $200,000 for professional programs like medical school, where the average cost of attendance often exceeds this amount significantly. The American Medical Association warns this could be a "punch in the face" for aspiring doctors, potentially worsening a projected physician shortage by creating financial barriers, especially for students from lower-income backgrounds. Experts suggest the new limits may force more students to rely on private loans, which offer fewer protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Lithium Deficiency May Be a Key Factor in Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 06:12:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study from Harvard Medical School suggests that a deficiency of the metal lithium in the brain could be a significant contributor to Alzheimer's disease. The research found that lithium occurs naturally in the brain and is crucial for maintaining nerve cell function, and its loss is one of the earliest changes leading to the disease. In mouse models, restoring lithium levels with a compound called lithium orotate, which is effective at very low doses, helped restore memory. These findings could offer a new strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>Business leaders are expressing confusion and uncertainty as they navigate the new, complex tariff landscape implemented by the Trump administration. With new duties of 10% to 50% now in effect for dozens of countries, chief executives from major companies like Zurich Insurance and Maersk have highlighted the need for clarity and predictability. While some welcome the end of the waiting period, the overarching sentiment is one of concern that the lack of certainty will delay investments and negatively impact global growth. The new tariffs have pushed the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest level since the Great Depression. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The return of the cooking competition "MasterChef" saw a notable drop in viewership for its series premiere, drawing just under two million viewers compared to 2.7 million for last year's launch. The pre-recorded series is being aired despite the recent sacking of its longtime hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, following a misconduct investigation. The BBC's decision to broadcast the series has faced backlash, and critics have noted that the new episodes feel awkward and lack energy, speculating they were re-edited to minimize the hosts' presence. Wallace and Torode were fired after a report upheld numerous complaints against them.</p>

It posits that her actions may stem from a life defined by seeking the approval of powerful men, a pattern established by her infamous father, Robert Maxwell. The piece suggests her intense, slavish devotion to Epstein, especially after her family's fall from grace, drove her to become his chief procurer. The analysis explores how her seemingly profound personal vacancy and a desire to please, untempered by morality, allowed her to commit monstrous and unforgivable acts.</p>

With a mandate to keep parks open despite budget cuts, remaining staff, including superintendents and scientists, are being diverted to frontline duties like cleaning bathrooms. This "survival mode" has forced the agency to sideline crucial long-term work, such as conservation, infrastructure repair, and scientific research.

          <p>Prosecutors have decided not to file criminal charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who shot a man in the back as he lay face down on the ground in 2021. The district attorney's office concluded there was "insufficient evidence" to prove Deputy Yen Liu was not acting in lawful self-defense when he shot Adrian Abelar. Body camera footage showed Abelar had thrown a gun away and had an empty outstretched hand when he was shot. Critics, including Abelar's attorney, argue the investigation was purposefully stalled and that the decision ignores clear evidence from the video.</p>
