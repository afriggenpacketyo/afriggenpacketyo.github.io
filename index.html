          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is experiencing a major leadership crisis following the ousting of Director Susan Monarez just weeks after her confirmation. In addition, four other senior officials, including the chief medical officer, have resigned, with one citing the "ongoing weaponizing of public health" as their reason for leaving. This upheaval occurs as the agency is still recovering from a recent fatal shooting at its Atlanta headquarters, adding to a period of significant instability and raising questions about the future of the nation's leading public health institution.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently targeted "Late Night" host Seth Meyers on social media, questioning NBC's decision to extend his contract through 2028 and insulting his talent and ratings. The article provides context on the long-standing animosity between the two, which dates back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. It frames the incident within the broader landscape of late-night television's role as a platform for political criticism and highlights the administration's increasingly contentious relationship with media figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a provocative political move, Republicans in the California assembly have introduced a resolution to split the state into two, separating the coastal Democratic-leaning areas from the more conservative inland regions. The proposal is a direct response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that aims to redraw congressional maps, which Republicans have labeled a "gavinmander." While this "two-state solution" is highly unlikely to succeed, it serves as a powerful messaging tool for the GOP to rally opposition against the redistricting effort ahead of the November special election.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war, this article examines China's evolving role in the international system it helped create as a key Allied power. Despite its significant sacrifices during World War II, Beijing now finds itself frequently portrayed as a revisionist power challenging the global order. The analysis suggests that China aims to use the anniversary to reassert its historical contributions and position itself as a guarantor of post-war norms, countering the Western narrative that casts it as an adversary in global affairs.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking highly probable in September, savers are advised to take strategic steps now to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Key recommendations include shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher rates, and precisely calculating how much cash can be deposited without risking early withdrawal penalties. It is also suggested to lock in the longest-term CD that fits one's budget to secure current high rates for an extended period before they inevitably decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit alleges that New Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond personally participated in covering up child sexual abuse committed by clergy members. The suit was filed not by survivors, but by a trustee for bondholders who claim the archdiocese concealed the extent of its abuse-related liabilities before they purchased $41 million in church debt. The filing cites investigative reporting and asks a judge to block Aymond's retirement benefits as a consequence of the alleged fraud and concealment of these widespread crimes.</p>

HELOCs currently offer lower average interest rates compared to home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, and the interest paid may also be tax-deductible. With home equity levels at a record high and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon which could lower variable HELOC rates further, now could be an opportune time to apply.
