          <p>Tropical Storm Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has dissipated after making landfall on Mexico's east coast as a tropical depression. The storm brought tropical storm conditions and warnings to the coast before weakening upon moving inland. Forecasters expect the system's remnants to deliver several days of heavy rain and potential flooding to the region. Meanwhile, officials are also monitoring the separate development of Tropical Storm Flossie off Mexico's Pacific coast.</p>

The lawyer claims it was "outrageous and deceptive" for the conference to hire the same law firm to conduct a supposedly independent investigation into a transgender athlete's alleged misconduct while that firm was also defending the conference in court over the athlete's eligibility. He accused the conference of prioritizing a political narrative over discovering the truth and protecting female athletes.</p>

They are alarmed by the creation of a new parent holding company, Ascendiun Inc., in Delaware, a move they claim was approved without public scrutiny. Critics fear this out-of-state structure could reduce regulatory oversight and allow the nonprofit to transfer billions in assets with few restrictions, potentially undermining its obligations to California's public.
