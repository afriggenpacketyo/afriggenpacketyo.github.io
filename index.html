          <p>President Vladimir Putin oversaw Russia's Victory Day commemorations in Moscow, marked by a military parade in Red Square and increased security measures following Ukrainian strikes. The event, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, saw the attendance of Chinese President Xi Jinping and over 20 other international leaders, signaling Putin's efforts to project global leadership despite Western isolation attempts. Russia had announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire for the event, which Ukraine dismissed as a propaganda move, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations. The days leading up to the parade saw a barrage of strikes between Moscow and Kyiv, causing flight cancellations and heightened restrictions in Moscow.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is defending the detainment of Ximena Arias-Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican national and Georgia college student, after she was arrested for traffic violations. Arias-Cristobal admitted to being in the U.S. illegally and does not have an application pending with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. DHS emphasized that many people in the U.S. illegally are being given the chance to self-deport via the Customs and Border Protection Home app, allowing them to return to America through legal avenues. Her father, Jose Francisco Arias-Tovar, was also detained at the same ICE facility after being arrested for speeding and driving without a license.</p>

          <p>A recent terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir has heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, pushing the two nations to the brink of war. Both countries have engaged in missile and drone attacks, raising concerns among international leaders. The conflict is rooted in a decades-old dispute over Kashmir, a Himalayan region claimed by both nations, with each controlling only a portion of it. Recent clashes have resulted in casualties on both sides, with accusations of acts of war and retaliatory strikes. India removed Kashmir's autonomy in 2019, further exacerbating the situation.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, in exchange for reciprocal treatment. This move signals a potential shift from India's protectionist trade policies, influenced by recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indian exports. While some experts believe the deal may not significantly harm domestic industries, others emphasize the importance of careful consideration to protect local businesses. A trade deal could benefit sectors like financials, materials, healthcare, and logistics in India, while the absence of a deal could negatively impact their earnings.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia commemorated his country’s victory against Nazi Germany with a large military parade in Moscow, attended by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and other international dignitaries. The event aimed to portray Putin as a leader of an emerging alliance of anti-Western and nonaligned states, despite Western efforts to isolate him after the invasion of Ukraine. However, the military display contrasts with Russia’s lack of decisive victory in the war, where it has only made incremental gains. The event, historically a unifying moment, has become another point of division due to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that China's exports jumped in April, driven by trade to Southeast Asian countries, even as President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods caused a sharp slowdown in shipments to the United States. Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent. Inside China, imports fell as demand continued to weaken. The April data is likely to give policymakers in Beijing a breather amid broader worries about the trade war’s impact on China’s economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Albania is preparing for parliamentary elections, seen as a critical test of the country's democratic maturity and its EU integration prospects. Prime Minister Edi Rama and the Socialist Party are seeking a fourth consecutive term, while the opposition remains fragmented.

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by a jump in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, compensating for a sharp decline in outbound goods to the U.S. due to high tariffs.

          <p>A woman who manages holiday lettings in Blackpool is facing potential bankruptcy after her flats were reclassified as "second homes," resulting in a significant council tax debt. The reclassification, part of a government crackdown on second homes and holiday lets, has impacted several businesses in the seaside resort. Under the new rules, Mrs. Robbins is liable to pay about £9,000 a year in council tax, a substantial increase from the previous business rates. The tax changes came as part of a government crackdown on second homes and holiday lets, following claims they were limiting the supply of housing in coastal and rural communities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may be reduced as top trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. He referenced the high import taxes imposed on China since his return to the White House, stating they are likely to decrease. The meeting in Switzerland signals a potential de-escalation of the trade war, although analysts caution that negotiations will likely be lengthy. The talks are set to occur shortly after the UK struck a tariffs deal with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>New soil testing by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has revealed elevated lead levels and other toxic metals at homesites previously cleaned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers following recent wildfires. In the Eaton burn scar, approximately 27% of soil samples from scraped areas and nearly 44% from unscraped areas exceeded California's lead standards for residential properties. These findings contradict claims of thorough cleanup and raise concerns about potential soil contamination ahead of rebuilding efforts. Experts recommend soil impact assessments as part of any rebuilding plan, but city and county officials have issued rebuilding permits without soil testing requirements.</p>
