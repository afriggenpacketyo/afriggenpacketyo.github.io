          <h2>US Officials Criticize Germany's Labeling of AfD as Extremist, Sparking Diplomatic Tension</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has criticized Germany's decision to label the far-right AfD party as extremist, leading to diplomatic tension between the NATO allies. US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, condemned the move, with Vance accusing Germany of rebuilding a "Berlin Wall" and Rubio calling it "tyranny in disguise." Germany's Foreign Ministry defended its decision as a result of a thorough investigation to protect its constitution, citing lessons learned from history about the need to stop right-wing extremism. The AfD, founded in 2013, has gained popularity by capitalizing on fears over migration and is now Germany's largest opposition party.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article reports that water shortages hampered firefighting efforts during the Pacific Palisades fire due to the shutdown of the Santa Ynez Reservoir for repairs. The city had considered reactivating the retired Pacific Palisades Reservoir as a temporary solution, but this plan was abandoned due to safety concerns. With both reservoirs out of service, firefighters relied on smaller tanks that were quickly depleted. The article notes that the inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the potential water supply in the area, raising questions about water management and its impact on the fire's destruction.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest China faces significant challenges in becoming a credible mediator in the Middle East, particularly in engaging with Syria's new government. China, a supporter of Bashar al-Assad, now faces a "reputational crisis" due to the new government's composition, which includes UN-identified "terrorists". Jesse Marks from the Stimson Centre's China program noted that China faces an uncomfortable dilemma in Syria.

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, to bolster its private economy. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely watching how the law will be implemented, particularly its impact on firms' ability to sue local governments and its protection against arbitrary fines. The law forbids administrative measures that intervene in economic disputes and prevents profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures. Rui Meng, an economics professor, believes the law will empower entrepreneurs in litigation against local governments, hoping courts will adjudicate such cases more fairly.</p>

          <p>Former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci advised Democrats to focus on their "purpose" to counter Trump's "hostile takeover" of the Republican Party. He suggested Democrats should open the party to a broader coalition and focus on the culture war rather than policy fights. Scaramucci stressed that Trump understands the cultural battlefield better than anyone and urged Democrats to find their "Wellington" before the 2026 midterms. He recommended Democrats realign as a pro-Constitution, pro-democracy party.</p>

          <h2>Rise in Autism Diagnoses: Increased Awareness or Genuine Increase?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There has been a significant increase in autism diagnoses, leading to questions about whether this reflects a genuine rise in autistic people or changes in diagnostic criteria. Studies show an exponential increase in diagnoses, but this could be due to broader definitions, better recognition of autism in women and girls, and more diagnoses among adults. While some worry about the "glamorization" of autism, others highlight the importance of diagnosis for accessing support and improving mental health. The article explores the complex factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses and the implications for individuals and society.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced plans to reorganize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and cut staffing to levels similar to the 1980s. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin stated the goal is to operate more efficiently. The agency plans major changes in the Office of Research and Development, potentially undermining scientific research and the ability to protect human health. Experts are concerned that budget and staff cuts could significantly impact research, with Zeldin previously announcing intentions to slash EPA's budget by 65% in coming years.</p>

Local residents have expressed concerns about restricted beach access, environmental impacts, and rising costs of living.
