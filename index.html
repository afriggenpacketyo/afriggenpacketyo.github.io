The significant stock increase followed the disclosure that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has acquired a 5 million share stake in the health insurer, valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This move is seen as a major vote of confidence in the company, which has been struggling with public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation, leading to a nearly 50% stock decline earlier in the year.

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate President Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without conceding Ukrainian territory to Russia.

          <p>A recent working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving key milestones traditionally associated with adulthood. Compared to previous generations, fewer are moving out of their parents' homes, getting married, having children, and securing stable employment. The report attributes this shift to increased economic barriers, such as rising living costs, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation and career paths.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has described such an intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument posits that government support is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung. This move would align with President Trump's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the U.S., ensuring domestic control over critical components for defense and AI.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell sharply by 14% after the company issued weak financial guidance for the upcoming quarter. The pessimistic forecast is primarily attributed to growing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China, compounded by ongoing trade issues. The company's CEO noted that Chinese clients are scaling back spending after a period of rapid manufacturing expansion, creating lower visibility for future earnings despite a strong performance in the most recent quarter.

The ruling is a significant development in the administration's effort to overhaul the consumer watchdog, though it will not take immediate effect to allow for a potential appeal.</p>
