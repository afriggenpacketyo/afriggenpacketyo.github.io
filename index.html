          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune, has been identified as the anonymous patriot who donated $130 million to pay U.S. military salaries during the government shutdown. President Trump announced the donation without naming Mellon, but the contribution amounts to only about $100 per service member. The gesture has also raised legal questions, as it may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from using funds not appropriated by Congress. The donation does little to offset the military's multi-billion dollar payroll costs but highlights the financial pressures caused by the political stalemate.</p>

          <p>A commentary in a significant Communist Party publication suggests that digital currencies are becoming a powerful tool in global geopolitics, potentially for military applications. The article posits that cryptocurrencies could be 'militarized' to create a sanction-proof economy by offering fast, secure, and anonymous transactions. It references a U.S. Pentagon initiative to test blockchain technology as evidence that digital assets are being considered a strategic tool for financial defense. This reflects growing concerns in China about its vulnerability to Western financial sanctions and its search for alternative economic pathways.</p>

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, The Octagon is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, with a rich history and a reputation for being haunted. The house temporarily served as the executive mansion for President James Madison after the White House was burned in 1814, and it was where he signed the treaty ending the War of 1812. The building's past includes housing enslaved people in its basement and later serving as a school and tenement housing. Now a museum, it is known for paranormal occurrences, such as flickering lights and unexplained alarms, adding a layer of mystery to its historical significance.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has sharply criticized Democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, accusing him of adopting a victim narrative while offending numerous groups. Speaking at an event where he received endorsements from faith leaders, Cuomo asserted that Mamdani has alienated 9/11 families, Jewish communities, and other New Yorkers with his rhetoric. Cuomo positioned these criticisms as central to his campaign, framing his opponent's approach as divisive. The conflict highlights the deep ideological divisions within the Democratic party playing out in the New York City mayoral race.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a large party in Robeson County, North Carolina, resulted in two fatalities and left seven other individuals in critical condition. In total, thirteen people were shot during the incident, which occurred early Saturday morning.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that E. coli from contaminated meat may be responsible for nearly 20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the bacteria from patients' infections back to strains found in grocery store meats, with turkey and chicken being the most common sources. The study also revealed a higher risk for individuals in lower-income areas, potentially due to differences in food quality and handling practices. These findings suggest that improved food safety standards in meat production and processing could significantly reduce the incidence of this common and sometimes dangerous infection.</p>

Panelists on 'Washington Week' discussed the move as a sign of President Trump's disregard for historical precedent and the traditional checks and balances of power. The rapid destruction of the historic structure, which housed the First Lady's office and held significant memories for past administrations, was described as 'shocking to the conscience.'

The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian television ad that was critical of U.S. tariffs. The halt in talks could keep steep 35% general tariffs and sector-specific levies on Canadian steel and aluminum in place for an extended period. Since these metals are crucial components in many manufactured products, the continued tariffs are likely to increase costs for U.S. manufacturers, who may pass them on to consumers.

          <p>Expansion club San Diego FC has concluded a record-breaking inaugural season in Major League Soccer, securing the Western Conference's top seed for the playoffs. The team set new MLS expansion records for most victories with 19 and most points with 63. The club's success is attributed to a philosophy centered on collective team spirit, data analytics, and a strong commitment to its 'Right to Dream' academy, which develops homegrown talent. With star players like Hirving 'Chucky' Lozano, the team now aims to become the first expansion side to win the MLS Cup since 1998.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic robot that mimics a jellyfish, designed for covert underwater surveillance and environmental monitoring. Described as an 'underwater phantom,' the drone is made of a transparent hydrogel material, operates nearly silently, and has very low power consumption. Its lifelike design and stealth capabilities make it suitable for observing fragile marine ecosystems without disturbance, inspecting underwater structures, and potentially for deep-sea military reconnaissance. The compact device weighs only 56 grams and measures 120mm in diameter.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Seattle mansion in the Hunts Point neighborhood for $63 million, two years after relocating to Miami with his wife, Lauren Sánchez. He had originally purchased the property for $37.5 million, realizing a significant profit from the sale. This financial move comes as Bezos's ownership stake in Amazon has fallen below 10% and amid an ongoing legal battle where he and Sánchez are seeking to have her estranged brother, Michael Sánchez, cover nearly $200,000 in legal fees related to a defamation lawsuit he lost.</p>

This move has significantly heightened tensions with Venezuela, whose President Nicolás Maduro accused the Trump administration of 'fabricating a war.' The deployment follows a U.S. military campaign that has destroyed several vessels in the region allegedly carrying drugs. U.S. officials maintain the goal is to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, but the substantial military buildup is viewed by Caracas as a direct threat aimed at overthrowing its government.</p>

Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as the candidate closer to the party leadership, is viewed as an expression of anxiety within the party about its current political standing. While not a landslide, the result reflects a desire for a change in direction amid recent controversies. Powell has indicated her critiques of the leadership will primarily be articulated privately as the party attempts to navigate its path forward.</p>

A significant factor in this gap is Berkshire's decision to sell off a large portion of its holdings in Apple. The tech giant's stock has surged over 50% since the selling began, meaning Berkshire left an estimated $50 billion in potential profits 'on the table.' Buffett has previously suggested the sale was partly motivated by the prospect of future capital gains tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist advises parents on how to say 'no' to their children in a way that builds connection rather than conflict. The key is to turn the boundary into a teachable moment by explaining the reasoning behind the limit, particularly for safety and kindness. Offering children control through limited choices can also empower them and increase cooperation. Consistency is crucial, as it helps children learn to trust and expect boundaries, creating a sense of safety and predictability even when they are upset with the rules.</p>

She suggests that without a parent watching from the sidelines, children are more likely to develop internal motivation, resilience, and a willingness to take risks without fear of judgment. This autonomy helps them become self-starters, a key trait for success in adulthood. Wambach recommends that when parents do attend games, they should focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship rather than on performance or the final score.</p>
