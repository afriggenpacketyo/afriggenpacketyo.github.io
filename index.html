          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding companies have agreed to a £100 million payment for affordable housing to conclude a regulatory investigation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was probing whether the firms illegally shared commercially sensitive information, potentially inflating house prices. While the companies do not admit any wrongdoing, the settlement allows the CMA to resolve the case without a formal legal decision on whether competition law was broken. This resolution aims to immediately benefit the housing market rather than pursuing a lengthy and complex investigation.</p>

          <p>An alternate juror from the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial has provided insight into the jury's decision to acquit the music mogul of racketeering and sex trafficking charges. The juror noted that the defense team effectively "poked holes" in the prosecution's case by highlighting inconsistencies in witness testimonies. Key cross-examinations of witnesses like Dawn Richard and Bryana Bongolan were cited as pivotal moments that weakened the government's arguments. Combs was, however, found guilty on two counts of transportation for prostitution and awaits sentencing.</p>

          <p>South Korea has returned six North Korean fishermen who had drifted across the maritime border into southern waters earlier this year. The Unification Ministry in Seoul stated the repatriation was conducted via the East Sea after the men repeatedly expressed their desire to go home. The decision has drawn some criticism from activists who question whether the fishermen's wishes were verified independently, suggesting UN agencies should have been involved. This event occurs amidst a complex backdrop of inter-Korean relations, with tens of thousands having defected from the North over the decades.</p>

          <p>At least three people, including two children, have died after torrential rains caused catastrophic flash flooding in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico. The Rio Ruidoso surged to a record 20 feet, exacerbated by unstable soil in areas previously devastated by wildfires. Emergency crews conducted dozens of swift-water rescues, saving people trapped in homes and vehicles, while dramatic footage showed a house being swept away by the powerful currents. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has declared a state of emergency to expedite federal assistance for the hard-hit community.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump met to discuss efforts to free hostages held in Gaza, with Netanyahu reaffirming his goal to eliminate Hamas. Concurrently, French President Emmanuel Macron, during a state visit to the UK, urged British parliamentarians to recognize Palestinian statehood, calling it the "only path to peace." This diplomatic activity unfolds as an international law expert criticized Israel's plan to create a permanent "humanitarian zone" in Gaza as a potential war crime, and Qatar hosts talks aimed at securing a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended fundamental reforms to the UK's criminal justice system to prevent its "total collapse" from a massive case backlog. The proposals include using judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud and reserving jury trials for the most serious cases. The aim is to expedite justice for victims and defendants who currently face years-long delays, with nearly 77,000 cases pending. While supported by police and magistrates, the plan has been met with concern from some barristers who argue it erodes the fundamental right to a trial by one's peers.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the UK is at a "pivotal moment" due to an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange, urging immediate government action. Since 2016, 213 firms have left, driven by factors like more attractive listings elsewhere and a lack of domestic investment. The CBI advocates for lighter regulation, better marketing, and tax incentives to encourage investment in British companies, including potential changes to cash ISA rules. The trend threatens the UK's financial services sector, which is a significant contributor to national tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a US Navy cruiser hit by a Japanese torpedo in 1942, has been discovered in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. Its discovery highlights a remarkable story of naval survival, where the crew performed makeshift repairs using coconut logs after the front of the ship was blown off. They then navigated the crippled vessel 1,800 miles in reverse to Australia for more substantial repairs. The ship was later fully repaired and went on to serve with distinction for the remainder of the war, earning 17 battle stars.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Labour government proceeds with renationalizing passenger rail services, a new conflict is emerging over the future of "open access" operators. These private companies, which compete with the main franchised services and bear their own financial risks, are credited with lowering fares and improving service on lines like the East Coast Main Line. However, the Transport Secretary has warned the industry regulator to be more stringent with new applications, citing concerns about lost revenue for the soon-to-be state-run services. This has sparked fears that the government may be trying to stifle competition, potentially harming consumers and innovation.</p>

A recent 3p increase in the per-meal funding rate was called "inadequate," with the actual cost of a meal estimated to be 80p higher than the government's provision.

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi to a 14-year prison term as part of a mass trial involving 21 individuals. Ghannouchi, leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, was charged with offenses including inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government. Other defendants, many of whom have fled the country, received sentences of up to 35 years. This verdict is the latest in a series of actions by President Kais Saied's government against political opponents, which critics decry as a dismantling of the country's democracy established during the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>In a tragic turn of events, the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp in Texas, was approved by state inspectors just two days before a catastrophic flood killed dozens of its campers and staff. While records show the camp met state regulations for having written disaster procedures, details of the plan itself are unclear. The camp did not relocate its hundreds of campers despite flood watches being issued more than 12 hours before the Guadalupe River surged to devastating levels. This revelation raises serious questions about the adequacy of the plan and the camp's preparedness for the foreseeable disaster.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged two people with illegally selling an SKS rifle to Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump last year. The defendants, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, have both pleaded guilty to federal gun-related charges. According to court filings, Cooper acted as a middleman for the sale, knowing that Routh was a convicted felon prohibited from owning firearms. Routh was allegedly found with a similar rifle outside Trump's Florida golf club six weeks after the sale, though prosecutors did not confirm it was the same weapon.</p>

          <h2>Hydrologists Note History of Catastrophic Floods Warned of Texas River Disaster</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to hydrologists, the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River in Texas was a known risk, with a long history of similar deadly events in the region known as "Flash Flood Alley." Experts at the West Gulf River Forecast Center recognized the potential for a major event and the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch hours before the disaster. The area has experienced major flooding over a dozen times in the last century, with steep terrain and rocky ground causing rivers to respond extremely quickly to heavy rainfall. The tragedy highlights the persistent challenges of communicating urgent warnings, especially for overnight events.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite an early solo home run from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' lineup was otherwise overwhelmed by the 23-year-old right-hander's arsenal, which included 21 pitches exceeding 100 mph. The loss marked the fifth consecutive defeat for the Dodgers, who struggled to generate any offense against the rookie. Even Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw praised Misiorowski's "unbelievable" and "special" performance on the mound.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new tariff threats against Japan and South Korea are raising concerns about a potential economic downturn for the two key U.S. allies. The proposed 25% tariffs target exports-dependent economies already struggling with slowing growth and existing duties on steel and autos. While Trump indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets further to U.S. goods, the move is seen as a significant pressure tactic. Economists warn the additional tariffs could further suppress GDP growth in both nations, which rely heavily on exports to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four days after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas, Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that at least 161 people are still missing in Kerr County alone, with the death toll rising to 109. The missing include five campers and a counselor from the hard-hit Camp Mystic. A massive search and rescue operation involving helicopters, drones, and hundreds of responders is underway, though hope of finding more survivors is fading. When questioned about who was to blame for the high death toll, Abbott dismissed the question's phrasing as being for "losers," drawing criticism for the remark amidst the ongoing tragedy.</p>
