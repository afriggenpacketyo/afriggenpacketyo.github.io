          <p>Boeing is seeking FAA approval to increase 737 Max production to 42 jets per month later this year, driven by improved airplane deliveries and reduced losses, according to CEO Kelly Ortberg. The company reported a smaller first-quarter net loss of $31 million compared to $355 million the previous year, with revenue rising 18% to $19.5 billion, surpassing analysts' estimates. Boeing's cash burn also improved, and the CEO emphasized progress in safety and manufacturing processes after recent accidents and quality concerns. The company is also selling parts of its digital aviation businesses to Thoma Bravo for $10.55 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has accused the Trump administration of obstructing court orders in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a suspected MS-13 gang member who was deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis claims the administration has refused to provide information about efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The Supreme Court has ordered the administration to facilitate his return for court proceedings. The Justice Department has cited attorney-client privilege and other secrecy rules to withhold information, but the judge deemed these claims unsubstantiated.</p>

However, this claim is overly simplistic and scientifically dubious, according to critics.

Experts suggest reducing meat and dairy production is a more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.</p>
