          <h2>UK Energy Bills Expected to Decrease in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 06:31:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that annual energy bills in the UK will decrease by Â£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This nearly 7% decrease would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit down to Â£1,720 from the current Â£1,849. While this fall offers some relief, energy prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, raising concerns about affordability for many households. The price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales, and Scotland, and is updated every three months by Ofgem, based on typical household energy usage.</p>

          <h2>Debate Over Child Care Quality Metrics Intensifies in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-simmering debate over what constitutes "quality" child care has come to the forefront in the United States, with progressives and conservatives holding differing views. Progressives emphasize credentialed teachers and academic standards, while conservatives prioritize nurturing care and parental preference. States are using Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) to measure and communicate quality, but evidence is mixed on whether these ratings predict better outcomes for children. The core tension remains between standardized measurement and the complex, relationship-based reality of quality care, with ongoing debates about how to balance measurable outcomes with family preferences.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of 9, with metastasis to the bone. The diagnosis followed the discovery of a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical exam. Possible treatment options include hormone therapy, or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which can reduce levels of male hormones that can fuel prostate cancer growth. Despite the cancer's aggressiveness, its hormone-sensitive nature offers a viable treatment pathway. The American Cancer Society emphasized the importance of early detection following the diagnosis.</p>

          <p>US advocacy groups are mounting a campaign to protect Medicaid and Obamacare from proposed Republican cuts of $880 billion, which could leave an estimated 13 million Americans without health insurance.

Critics argue that these cuts will disproportionately affect low-income, disabled, and elderly Americans. The health secretary defended the proposals, but some Republicans question the strategy.

          <p>President Donald Trumpâ€™s second term has so far been dominated by his aggressive use of executive power â€” but now, heâ€™s finally trying to get something through Congress. The House bill would primarily extract savings from Medicaid by adding work requirements, a change expected to save $715bn, according to early estimates from the congressional budget office. Medicaid is a public health insurance program that covers about 71 million low-income, disabled and elderly Americans. House Republicansâ€™ desire to allow premium tax credits available through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to expire. ACA, or Obamacare, tax credits lower the cost of health insurance individuals can purchase on regulated, state-based health insurance exchanges. Together, the congressional budget office estimates that these proposals could cause more than 13 million people to lose insurance by 2034.</p>

The author notes that structured environments can help facilitate stillness, offering a shift in temperature, color, or sound to remove individuals from their routines. Spaces that encourage stillness, such as hot tubs, temples, and museums, provide an opportunity to wash away the distractions and find clarity.
