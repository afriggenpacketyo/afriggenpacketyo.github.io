          <p>A California family is suing Harrison-Ross Mortuary in Compton after discovering the wrong body dressed in their uncle's clothes in his casket. Amentha Hunt noticed the discrepancy while preparing her uncle, Otis Adkinson, for burial, but was initially dismissed by a mortuary worker. The family waited three hours for the mortuary to correct the error, and it remains unclear whose body was mistakenly placed in the casket. Hunt's attorney, Elvis Tran, emphasizes the need for improved standards of care to prevent similar incidents, while the funeral home denies the allegations and plans to file a cease-and-desist letter.</p>

Richard stated he hasn't spoken to his 25-year-old son in over a decade, and that Guy changed after his time in Twentynine Palms. FBI investigators believe Guy, who is presumed dead, held anti-natalist beliefs and intentionally targeted the American Reproductive Centers with explosives. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities seeking public assistance to trace Guy's movements before the explosion, which is being treated as an international act of terrorism.</p>

Nature Conservation Cymru is feeding the voles glitter-covered apples to track their movements via their droppings, with different colors of glitter used to identify different families. The glitter is biodegradable and veterinary-approved to ensure it is harmless to the animals. By tracking the voles, conservationists hope to adjust the environment to help the species disperse and survive, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks.</p>

The site is one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique opportunity to study a single community of a single species from a specific moment in time.

The move has weakened the U.S. dollar and increased Treasury bond yields, reflecting investor concerns about the country's fiscal outlook.

          <p>The House Budget Committee advanced President Trump's stalled bill to cut taxes and spending after conservatives initially blocked it, citing concerns about insufficient debt reduction. After negotiations, the conservatives switched their votes to "present," allowing the bill to move forward, though they still seek deeper cuts to health and environmental programs. The legislation, which would make President Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition from moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>Across Europe, far-right parties are gaining traction, with varying degrees of success and influence. While Germany considers banning the Alternative for Germany (AfD), other countries see similar parties in government or leading coalitions. The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÃ–) has a history of coalition governments, while France's National Rally (NR) has softened its image under Marine Le Pen. Italy is led by Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy, and the Netherlands' Party for Freedom (PVV) leads a coalition government. These parties share common themes such as immigration concerns and criticism of the EU, but differ in their approaches and ideologies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared another hurdle in the House after conservatives initially rebelled over concerns about insufficient spending cuts.

The bill's next stop is the Rules Committee, which can make further updates before a potential floor vote.</p>

The imagery shows new tents, warehouses, and renovations to fighter jet shelters, indicating a longer-term expansion. While NATO officials state this is not a buildup like the one before the Ukraine invasion, the moves reflect Moscow's perception of a threat due to Finland's recent NATO membership. Finnish defense officials anticipate Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the border after the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war ends.</p>

          <p>The author argues that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a continuation of the Soviet Union's historical pattern of occupying Eastern European countries under the guise of liberation. The article highlights the forced imposition of Russian citizenship, confiscation of property, and reversal of memory politics in occupied regions of Ukraine. It draws parallels between current Russian tactics and those used by the Soviets in Eastern Europe, including mass deportations and the brutal rule of secret police. The author calls for a deeper understanding of Soviet occupation as a crime in modern European history to comprehend Russia's actions and ensure European security.</p>
