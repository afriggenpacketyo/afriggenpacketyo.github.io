          <h2>Credit Card Interest Rates Rise Despite Stable Federal Reserve Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 12:25:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, credit card interest rates continue to climb, reaching the highest levels since December. The average annual percentage rate (APR) is now just over 20%, with new cards averaging 24.3%. Experts suggest this trend is due to card issuers mitigating their exposure against borrowers who may default, along with increased consumer demand for credit amid economic uncertainty. Consumers carrying a balance from month to month are most affected by these high APRs, as they only kick in for new loans and not old debts; even an eventual Fed rate cut may not provide much relief.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing low student loan rates for the fall of 2025 requires preparation and comparison, starting with maximizing federal funding options by completing the FAFSA. Private lenders offer various student loan products, so comparing APRs, fees, and repayment terms is essential. Optimizing one's credit profile, using a cosigner, and taking advantage of rate discounts can further lower rates. Considering shorter repayment terms can also lead to lower rates, but it is important to balance this with affordability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing a new national priority voucher plan to expedite drug reviews for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." The plan aims to cut review times to one to two months by allowing companies to submit drug applications before final clinical trial results. In the program's first year, the FDA will give vouchers to companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While this move is seen as positive for the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the risks of speeding up drug reviews and potential political influence.</p>

          <p>An expert on war powers argues that President Trump does not require congressional approval to strike Iran, citing the president's constitutional authority to use force abroad. While Congress holds the sole power to declare war, the president acts as commander in chief, directing the military. The expert suggests that resolutions in the Senate and House requiring a vote before any force is used against Iran are forms of "political opportunism." He concludes that Congress' real power over war lies in its ability to control funding for the Pentagon and military.</p>

          <p>Tesla has secured its first deal to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, amid strained trading relations between Beijing and Washington. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), is expected to be the largest of its kind in China upon completion. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems help balance electricity supply and demand, particularly with intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. Tesla's Shanghai battery factory has already produced over 100 Megapacks, each capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours.</p>

Concerns are growing that neglected preventative care could lead to emergencies and further strain public resources, and there are concerns that usage of health services could make them targets.</p>

It also provides portfolio diversification benefits at a more affordable cost. Investors are encouraged to consider silver as a valuable addition to their portfolio, particularly for those seeking affordable diversification and inflation protection. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling supports a challenge by oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, arguing that the waiver allowing California to set tougher standards caused financial harm. California has stipulated that only zero-emission cars will be sold there by 2035, a move that has faced opposition. Environmentalists argue that the waiver has helped push forward vehicle innovation and cut greenhouse gases, as transportation is a leading source of pollution.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller suggested the central bank could cut interest rates as early as July, sparking a rally in stocks. Waller's argument centers around the notion that import taxes will result in a one-time increase in the price level of imported goods and not provide a re-accelerant for inflation. However, rising oil prices, a declining dollar, and the potential for increased U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war could lead to more lasting inflationary pressures. The rising unemployment rate among recent college graduates may also be a result of technological change displacing workers, making interest rate reductions ineffective.</p>
