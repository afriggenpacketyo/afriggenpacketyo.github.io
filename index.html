The DHS asserts that the father is a lieutenant in the gang involved in serious crimes, while the mother recruits young women for drug smuggling and prostitution. The child was removed from a deportation flight for her safety and placed in foster care under the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, emphasizing the administration's priority to protect children from abuse and exploitation.</p>

This reversal is largely attributed to the return of Donald Trump and his threats of tariffs, which have rallied support for Liberal leader Mark Carney, positioning him as the steady hand needed to navigate relations with the U.S. While the Conservatives focus on domestic issues and voter frustration, Trump's influence has become a central theme, motivating progressive voters and reshaping the electoral dynamics.</p>
