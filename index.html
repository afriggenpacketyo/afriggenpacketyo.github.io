          <p>China's bioeconomy is rapidly expanding, now contributing over 7% to the country's GDP, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. In 2024, 93 new drugs were approved, the highest in five years, and medical device patent applications reached 70% of the global total. This growth highlights China's strong momentum in life sciences and biotechnology, with new systems implemented to boost drug innovation and identify opportunities. The nation is actively closing the biotech gap with the United States.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher as investors await the crucial U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Sentiment improved after recent U.S. payroll data hinted at a September rate cut without signaling a severe economic downturn. However, Danish wind farm developer Orsted saw its shares drop after revising its full-year earnings guidance downwards, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds and ongoing legal battles over U.S. projects. The broader market remains sensitive to global economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, surpassing analyst forecasts, attributed to sunny weather and the women's Euro football tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) had delayed the release due to data quality concerns and has now revised past figures, aiming for improved reliability. Despite the monthly rise, sales in the three months to July were down 0.6% compared to the previous quarter. Experts warn that the positive factors for July are unlikely to be sustained.</p>

          <p>A United Nations weather agency report states that wildfires significantly contributed to air pollution in the past year, a problem expected to worsen with climate change. The World Meteorological Organization's bulletin detailed how fires in the Amazon, Canada, and Siberia led to above-average levels of harmful PM 2.5 particles, impacting air quality across continents. While acknowledging a decline in particle pollution in Eastern China due to reduction efforts, the report emphasizes the growing risks to human health and ecosystems from these "witches' brew" of pollutants.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery to remove skin cancer, his spokeswoman confirmed. This procedure follows a previous cancerous skin lesion removal in 2023 and a diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer that spread to his bones in May. Biden, 82, has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving office. The Biden family has a history of advocating for cancer research, as their son Beau died from brain cancer in 2015.</p>

          <p>PBS is cutting approximately 15% of its workforce, eliminating over 100 positions, due to federal funding cuts by Congress and the Trump administration. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is set to shut down, impacting PBS and its member stations, which historically relied on federal funds for 10-15% of their revenue. PBS CEO Paula Kerger stated the system faces a 21% revenue hit, forcing difficult choices despite some private grant successes. This financial strain is also leading to layoffs at individual public media stations nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," reverting to its pre-1947 title. While congressional assent is typically required for such a change, the order will authorize "secondary titles" and instruct the Defense Secretary to recommend permanent legislative actions. Trump believes the new name projects a "stronger message of readiness and resolve." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth publicly acknowledged the change, signaling a shift in the perceived image of the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department is considering a Justice Department request to authorize up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, aiming to address a backlog of over 3.4 million cases. This plan follows the Trump administration's recent loosening of job requirements for these roles, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to preside over hearings.

          <p>This article critically examines President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," labeling it "inanity" and "cringe." It argues that the original 1947 renaming reflected a shift towards ongoing national security rather than discrete periods of conflict. The piece highlights that past military leaders and other global powers, including Russia and China, use "Defense" in their military department names. The author suggests the change is a theatrical move driven by a desire to project a "tough guy" image, rather than a thoughtful policy decision.</p>

The mountainous terrain severely hampers rescue and relief efforts, which are mostly conducted by helicopters. The Taliban government has appealed for international aid, with the UN releasing emergency funds and the UK pledging £1 million. Afghanistan's location on active fault lines makes it highly susceptible to frequent and devastating seismic activity.</p>
