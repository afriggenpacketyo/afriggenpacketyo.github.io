        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SK Hynix reported a substantial increase in quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. The company's first-quarter operating profit surged by 158% year-on-year, reflecting the growing impact of AI on the memory market. However, SK Hynix cautioned about potential demand volatility in the second half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies. The company anticipates continued spending on AI by Big Tech, spurred by open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary pause on discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongfully deported to El Salvador. The pause, requested by the Trump administration, comes after the judge ordered the government to fully answer questions about the deportation. Abrego Garcia, who has family in Maryland, was deported despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration claims his alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return, a claim disputed by his wife and attorney.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, marking the first contraction since 2020, primarily due to a significant fall in construction activity. The Bank of Korea had warned of slower growth, citing weakened domestic demand and exports due to political uncertainties and trade conditions. The country has been facing political instability with the impeachment trials of former president and prime minister, as well as ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., including tariffs on steel and automobiles. Analysts anticipate further rate cuts and fiscal stimulus to address the challenging economic backdrop.</p>

          <p>A fossil discovery in northeastern China has revealed a complex prehistoric food chain involving dinosaurs and mammals. The remains of a newly identified dinosaur species, Huadanosaurus sinensis, were found with two small mammals inside its stomach. One of the mammals was related to the Repenomamus, a mammal known to prey on small dinosaurs. This creates an ecological loop where the dinosaur preyed on a mammal that itself preyed on dinosaurs, highlighting the predator-prey dynamics of the Early Cretaceous period.</p>
