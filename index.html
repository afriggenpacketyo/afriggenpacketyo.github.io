          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before the Senate, denying accusations from the recently fired CDC Director, Susan Monarez. Monarez claimed in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Kennedy pressured her to preapprove recommendations from a newly appointed, vaccine-skeptic advisory panel. During the heated hearing, Kennedy called Monarez's claim a lie, stating he never had a private meeting with her and that witnesses could corroborate his account. The conflict highlights the ongoing turmoil within U.S. public health agencies following significant changes to vaccine policy and advisory committees under the new administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has expressed strong disapproval of the decision by Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest from the American company Caterpillar. The fund cited "unacceptable risk" of the company's equipment contributing to rights violations in the Gaza conflict as the reason for selling its stake. U.S. officials called the claims illegitimate and are engaging with the Norwegian government, though Norway's finance minister insists the decision was made independently by the fund's managers, not for political reasons. The move has also drawn criticism from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who suggested potential U.S. retaliatory actions.</p>

          <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry has reiterated its firm opposition to the deployment of any foreign military personnel in Ukraine, labeling the idea as "unacceptable." This statement came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a joint call with President Donald Trump and other European leaders to discuss security contributions. Following the call, Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his efforts and emphasized the shared view that pressure on Russia must be intensified to end the three-year-long war. The discussions highlight the ongoing diplomatic maneuvering and starkly different visions for achieving peace and security in the region.</p>

          <p>A mass stabbing incident in the Hollow Water First Nation community in Manitoba, Canada, has resulted in one death and at least six injuries. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) confirmed that the suspect in the attack has also died. Emergency services transported eight people to local hospitals with varying injuries following what police described as a "mass casualty" event. The RCMP's major crimes unit is leading the investigation, and officials have stated there is no longer a risk to public safety.

          <p>The recent assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a former leader of Ukraine's parliament, in Lviv has intensified concerns about the safety of politicians and activists within the country. Parubiy was a prominent figure during the 2014 Maidan Revolution and became a target in what experts believe is part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy to destabilize Ukrainian society. A suspect has been arrested and confessed, claiming personal motives, but Ukrainian officials and analysts point to a potential "Russian connection" involving manipulation by intelligence services. The murder has prompted calls for increased security measures and better psychological support for families affected by the war.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly declined to state whether he would dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if an investigation finds she broke the ministerial code. Rayner referred herself to the standards adviser after admitting she underpaid stamp duty on a property, which she attributed to incorrect legal advice. While Starmer affirmed he would act on the adviser's report, he did not specify what that action would be, drawing criticism from opposition parties. The situation is being compared to Boris Johnson's previous handling of a similar issue, with critics accusing the current government of hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits is a critical financial choice for retirees, with significant implications for their monthly income. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, doing so results in a permanently reduced payment. Waiting until the full retirement age, typically 66 or 67, provides the standard benefit amount. However, delaying claims until age 70 can increase monthly payments by approximately 8% for each year of deferral, maximizing the guaranteed income stream for life. The article suggests that the best age depends on individual circumstances, including health, financial need, and other retirement income sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Housing Finance Chief Bill Pulte Declines to Reveal Source of Tip in Lisa Cook Mortgage Fraud Accusation</h2>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, repeatedly refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a CNBC interview, Pulte argued that revealing his sources would be reckless, despite questions that his actions create the perception of a political weaponization of his agency. The accusations have led President Trump to move to fire Cook from the Fed's board, a move she is challenging in court. Pulte's aggressive social media campaign against Cook has intensified concerns about political interference with the central bank's independence.</p>

          <h2>New Book Explores the Pervasive Influence of Conjure, a Spiritual Tradition Forged in Slavery, on American Culture</h2>

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep and often unacknowledged influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved Africans, on mainstream American culture. The book argues that traditions from cooking black-eyed peas for New Year's to the thematic elements of blues music have roots in conjure rituals. Stewart traces how Black women, as the primary practitioners of this domestic art, shaped American practices in medicine, food, and spirituality. Amid a recent wave of cultural depictions in films like "Sinners" and shows like "Lovecraft Country," the book highlights the resilience and enduring legacy of this hybrid spiritual system.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic accident involving Lisbon's historic Elevador da Gloria funicular has resulted in the deaths of 16 people and left approximately 20 others injured. The streetcar derailed on its steep track, careening down the hill and crashing into a building in the city center. Among the victims were both local residents, including a transport worker, and foreign tourists from several different countries. The Portuguese government has declared a national day of mourning, and an investigation into the cause of the disaster is underway, with initial speculation pointing towards a potential cable rupture on the century-old transport system.</p>

This expansion aims to improve the accuracy of flood warnings and provide actionable information to emergency managers and the public.

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman convicted in 2010 for the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer, is facing a second trial after her initial life sentence was overturned. The case involves a bizarre series of events from 2007, where Todd Stermer died from severe burns after a house fire, but was also struck by a van his wife was driving as she claimed she was trying to get help. After serving nearly nine years, a federal judge overturned her conviction due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel. Now a free woman, she must face a new jury as prosecutors refile the murder and arson charges against her.</p>

          <p>Texas is set to enact a new law that allows its residents to file civil lawsuits against any out-of-state provider who supplies abortion pills to someone within Texas. Successful plaintiffs, including the pregnant woman's relatives, could be awarded at least $100,000 in damages. The law, which applies to the two-pill regimen that accounts for nearly two-thirds of U.S. abortions, is seen by opponents as a tool to intimidate and harass providers in states where abortion remains legal. The legislation is expected to face significant legal challenges, potentially leading to a Supreme Court decision on the conflict between state laws.</p>

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old resident of Miami Gardens, has finally obtained her birth certificate for the first time in her life. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she was never officially registered and lived her entire life without this fundamental document. The lack of a birth certificate became a significant obstacle with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. After a lengthy legal process initiated by her son to prove her existence, and with help from local media coverage, she has now received her official birth certificate and a new Real ID, opening the door to future international travel.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that his government is considering the implementation of a digital ID system as a measure to tackle illegal immigration and employment. Starmer suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in verifying the right to work in the UK, noting that the public debate on identity systems has evolved significantly over the past two decades. A previous attempt by a Labour government to introduce physical ID cards was scrapped due to privacy concerns. Officials are now examining how a digital system, similar to one used in Estonia, could streamline identity verification and reduce the use of fraudulent documents.</p>
