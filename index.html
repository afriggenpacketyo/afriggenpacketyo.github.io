          <p>Community members are mourning the two men killed in the terror attack at a Manchester synagogue, identified as Melvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53. Neighbors and friends paid tribute to the victims, remembering Mr. Cravitz as a gentle man who was "forever smiling" and Mr. Daulby as an "angel" who was always helpful and kind to local children. The attack, which occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, also left three other people with serious injuries. Greater Manchester Police later revealed that one of the victims was tragically hit by police gunfire as officers engaged the attacker, who was shot dead at the scene.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Daniel Walker of Heaton Park synagogue described the terrifying moments he and others held the doors shut as an attacker tried to force his way inside during a deadly assault. The rabbi stated he witnessed both "evil" and "genuine heroism" as congregants worked together to prevent the assailant from entering the building, an action that likely saved many lives as hundreds were expected for the full Yom Kippur service. The attacker, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, killed two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, by driving into people and stabbing one before being shot dead by police. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, with the community now grappling with fear while also showing support and resilience.</p>

          <p>Scotland is bracing for Storm Amy, the first named storm of the season, with forecasts of wind gusts reaching up to 100mph in exposed areas. The Met Office has issued two amber warnings for high winds, indicating a potential risk to life from flying debris across large parts of northern and north-western Scotland. The severe weather has already caused power outages in the Western Isles and led to widespread travel cancellations, including numerous ScotRail and ferry services. Authorities are urging the public to avoid unnecessary travel and to plan ahead for significant disruptions, with several major road bridges also facing closures or restrictions.</p>

          <p>The iconic children's television show 'Reading Rainbow' is returning after nearly two decades, adapted for a new generation of viewers. The reboot will be available on YouTube and features a new host, Mychal Threets, a librarian who gained popularity on social media for his enthusiastic promotion of reading. While original host LeVar Burton is not directly involved, the new series maintains the show's core mission of encouraging a love for books among children. The first of four episodes will premiere on the Kidzuko YouTube channel, with hopes for a second season if the new digital format proves successful with today's young audiences.</p>

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs appeared in a Manhattan court for sentencing on two counts of transportation for prostitution. Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of at least 11 years, arguing that the public must be defended from what they described as Combs' history of violence. In contrast, his defense team has requested a sentence of no more than 14 months, which would allow for his release by December given time already served. The hearing featured emotional appeals from Combs' lawyers, who highlighted his business success and positive impact on the Black community, while the judge noted a lack of remorse from Combs regarding the specific crimes for which he was convicted.</p>

          <p>This editorial argues that Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is entering her first party conference in a precarious position, with the party's poll numbers lower than after their last election defeat. The article criticizes her analysis of the party's failings, suggesting her claim that the Tories "governed left" is a revisionist view that ignores policies like austerity and a hard Brexit. It contends that her strategic choices, such as proposing to repeal the 2008 Climate Change Act, align the party with a fanatical right-wing agenda and alienate mainstream voters. The author concludes that her leadership has so far failed to present a viable path for the party's renewal or return to power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has reached its third day, with the Senate scheduled to vote again on competing funding bills from both Republicans and Democrats. Negotiations appear to be at a standstill, raising the likelihood that the shutdown will continue through the weekend. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has insisted that Democrats must pass a clean, seven-week funding bill before any other issues, such as healthcare provisions, can be negotiated. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is leveraging the shutdown to threaten mass layoffs of federal workers, with the Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought depicted as the "Grim Reaper" in an AI-generated video posted by the president.</p>

Norris, who finished fifth fastest, described it as a "bad day" and expressed frustration with his car's performance, even after a pit lane collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc that damaged his front wing. The session was disrupted by two red flags caused by separate crashes involving Mercedes' George Russell and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson.

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, both Apple and Google have removed apps from their online stores that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Apple first removed ICEBlock and similar apps after Attorney General Pam Bondi directly requested their removal, citing safety risks to law enforcement. Google followed suit, stating that while ICEBlock was never on its platform, it had removed other similar apps for policy violations. The move comes after the FBI reported that a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had recently searched for such tracking apps, intensifying the debate over their use.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for consumers contacted by debt collectors, advising against making immediate payments without proper verification. It outlines three crucial steps: first, validating the debt by requesting a written notice and documentation to confirm its legitimacy and ownership. Second, exploring alternative options such as negotiating a settlement for a lower amount or arranging a structured payment plan, while also being aware of the state's statute of limitations on debt. Finally, it stresses the importance of getting any payment agreement in writing before sending money to ensure the terms are clear and the account will be reported as resolved to credit bureaus.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a new U.S.-backed peace proposal for Gaza, warning of severe consequences if the deal is rejected. The 20-point plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of detained Palestinians. However, a senior Hamas figure has indicated the group is likely to reject the proposal, partly because it requires them to disarm and hand over all hostages early in the process. The plan also stipulates that Hamas will have no future role in governing Gaza, a point of contention in the ongoing mediation efforts.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is primarily caused by a dispute over the extension of enhanced premium tax credits for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These subsidies, which help 22 million Americans afford their coverage, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democrats are demanding that any government funding bill include an extension of these credits, warning that their expiration could cause insurance premiums to more than double for many households. With insurers already planning significant rate hikes for 2026, the stalemate in Washington threatens to create financial hardship for millions who rely on the marketplace for affordable health coverage.</p>

          <p>Internal government data shows that a significant portion of arrests made during the Trump administration's federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C. were related to immigration. Of the more than 3,550 arrests since the operation began, nearly 1,400 were administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for civil immigration violations. While the White House stated the operation's focus is on crime regardless of immigration status, the data highlights the prominent role of immigration enforcement in the crackdown. The operation has also led to arrests for homicide, narcotics, and firearms offenses, with a similar surge now underway in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece questions when top U.S. military leaders will push back against President Trump's increasing use of armed forces for domestic law enforcement. The author argues that recent deployments in U.S. cities and the establishment of "national defense areas" along the border blur the line between military and civilian authority, potentially violating the Posse Comitatus Act. The article points to a recent meeting where Trump told military commanders that cities run by Democrats are an "invasion from within" and should be used as training grounds. The author suggests that Trump is reshaping the military into a partisan force, creating a troubling precedent for American democracy.</p>

The attack, which killed two people, has intensified anxieties that have been building, with some drawing parallels to pre-1930s Germany.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the structural reasons why government shutdowns are a recurring issue in the United States but are virtually nonexistent in other Western democracies like the United Kingdom. The key differences lie in the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. In the U.S., Congress holds significant power over the purse and budget timeline, creating more opportunities for deadlock, especially with a bicameral legislature and the Senate's 60-vote threshold. In contrast, the UK's parliamentary system gives the executive branch more control over proposing spending, and the political stakes are higher, as losing a budget vote can trigger new elections, incentivizing party discipline.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago transit system projects, citing the need for a review to ensure compliance with new rules barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements. The Department of Transportation blamed the government shutdown, initiated by Democrats according to their statement, for slowing this review process. This action is the latest in a series of funding freezes targeting projects in Democratic-led cities and states, which critics like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have condemned as a political tactic that hurts the economy and residents. The affected projects are the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization.</p>

          <p>A judge has sentenced Michael and Kerry Ives to life in prison for the murder of their two-year-old grandson, Ethan Ives-Griffiths, who died from a catastrophic head injury. Michael Ives received a minimum term of 23 years, while Kerry Ives received 17 years. The boy's mother, Shannon Ives, was sentenced to 12 years for allowing his death. The judge described the grandparents' actions as a "campaign to break" the toddler, stating that Ethan was beaten, starved, and deprived of fluids. In a victim impact statement, Ethan's father expressed his profound grief, stating his son deserved to be in a safe environment but was instead horrifically abused.</p>

          <p>With U.S. home equity reaching a record $17.8 trillion, homeowners have a significant financial resource they can tap into. This article outlines the cheapest ways to borrow against this equity in the current interest rate environment. A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is presented as the most affordable option, with average rates at 7.88% and the potential to decrease further with anticipated Fed rate cuts. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, starting around 8.21%, which can be advantageous long-term. For seniors aged 62 and older, a reverse mortgage is also a low-cost option as it doesn't require monthly repayments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the newly-elected leader of the UK's Green Party, used his conference speech to propose a tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to fund public services and combat the cost-of-living crisis. He argued that such a tax could pay for universal free childcare, special needs education, and rural bus routes, making Britain more affordable. Polanski, who describes himself as an "eco-populist," also strongly defended migrants and refugees while criticizing the Labour Party for, in his view, following the lead of Reform UK on immigration. The speech notably focused more on social and economic inequality than on traditional environmental issues.</p>

          <p>Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, has been the site of intense fighting between Hamas security forces and armed members of the al-Mujaida clan, one of the area's largest families. The confrontation began when Hamas forces raided the neighborhood, claiming to be targeting individuals collaborating with Israel, resulting in the deaths of five clan members. In retaliation, armed relatives fought back, leading to hours of clashes with reports of over 11 Hamas members being killed. This internal violence highlights the deep-seated tensions within Gaza and raises fears of a broader civil conflict, which is a key factor complicating Hamas's response to international ceasefire proposals.</p>

          <p>Eight OPEC+ member countries are anticipated to approve another increase in oil production, though key players Saudi Arabia and Russia disagree on the size of the hike. Saudi Arabia is reportedly pushing for a substantial increase of up to 548,000 barrels per day to regain market share. In contrast, Russia favors a more modest rise of 137,000 barrels per day, similar to the previous month's increase, to avoid depressing oil prices and due to its own production constraints from sanctions. This divergence comes as OPEC+ continues to unwind the production cuts it implemented earlier, with oil prices already declining in anticipation of more supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal government shutdown has prevented the release of the September jobs report, a critical economic indicator, leaving policymakers, investors, and the public without key data at a potentially pivotal moment for the economy. Former officials from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirm that the data has already been collected and processed, but the Trump administration has not released it. This information blackout comes as other indicators, like a private report from ADP, suggest a potential job loss in September. Experts warn that without this data, and with the upcoming inflation report also at risk, the Federal Reserve will have an incomplete picture for making crucial decisions about interest rates.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a farm in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of approximately 13,000 pigs. According to Ukraine's state emergency service, the strike caused a massive fire that destroyed eight stalls at the farming enterprise and injured one worker. This incident appears to be part of a broader Russian assault on Ukraine's natural gas infrastructure, with officials reporting that 381 drones and 25 missiles targeted gas facilities in the Kharkiv and Poltava regions. Ukrainian officials have condemned the strikes as deliberate terror against civilian infrastructure with no military purpose, aimed at disrupting the upcoming heating season.</p>

          <p>This article details the significant financial challenges pediatricians face in providing vaccines, contrary to claims that it is a highly profitable enterprise. Doctors must make large upfront investments to purchase vaccines, with very small reimbursement margins and high risks associated with storage and administration. The Trump administration's anti-vaccine rhetoric and policy changes, such as altering recommendations from the CDC's advisory committee, have created unpredictable demand and increased costs for providers. This financial pressure, combined with a pre-existing workforce shortage, is making pediatrics a more challenging field and may lead some doctors to stop offering certain immunizations or leave the practice altogether.</p>

According to sources, the platform will initially offer access to bitcoin and ether through a partnership with the startup Zerohash. This move positions OnePay to compete with other major financial apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto services. The integration aligns with OnePay's strategy to become a comprehensive "super app" for digital finance, potentially allowing users to convert crypto to cash for in-store purchases or to pay off balances within the app's ecosystem.</p>

Workers with extensive experience and recent graduates alike are struggling, reporting that they have submitted hundreds of applications with little success in a market where employers are demanding more experience.

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with top military commanders at Quantico, Virginia, is being analyzed as a significant moment in the politicization of the U.S. armed forces. During the event, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered partisan speeches, railing against "woke" policies and describing Democratic-run cities as an internal threat that should serve as military "training grounds." While some insiders were relieved that the meeting did not result in an immediate purge of generals or demands for loyalty oaths, critics view it as Trump using senior military leaders as a political backdrop. The event has intensified concerns about the administration's willingness to deploy the military for domestic political purposes.</p>
