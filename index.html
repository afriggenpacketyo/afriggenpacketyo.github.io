          <h2>University Professors Increasingly Adopt AI for Curriculum Development and Research</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by AI company Anthropic reveals that university professors are increasingly using generative AI tools like Claude for their work. The research, based on thousands of conversations, shows that 57% of usage is for curriculum development, such as creating lesson plans and interactive simulations. While AI helps automate tedious administrative tasks, some academics express concern over its use for grading, fearing it could devalue education and student-professor relationships.</p>

          <p>Berlin is set to impose heavy fines on its long-standing "zu verschenken" or "to gift" tradition, where residents leave unwanted items on the street for others to take. The city's environment department argues the practice has led to excessive illegal dumping, costing over €10 million annually in cleanup fees. While officials promote formal recycling centers, sustainability advocates fear the crackdown is short-sighted and may lead to more usable goods being thrown in bins, undermining the city's circular economy goals.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off about a third of its nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion in new investment to stabilize its finances. The plan aims to rebuild the heavily criticized company without taxpayer funding, focusing on improving performance, reducing pollution, and rebuilding public trust after years of operational failures.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests, largely organized by "Generation Z" on social media, is challenging governments across Africa. In Madagascar, demonstrations over water and electricity shortages led the president to dissolve his government, while similar movements are active in Kenya, Togo, and Morocco. These protests reflect widespread frustration over poor governance, corruption, and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions, signaling a continent-wide reckoning for leaders who have failed to meet the needs of their young populations.</p>

          <p>Recent NFL rule changes and the use of specialized "K" balls have dramatically increased the importance and excitement of the kicking game. Kickers are now attempting and making field goals from unprecedented distances, with some experts predicting a 70-yarder is imminent. A new kickoff formation has led to a massive increase in returns, while also making extra points and field goals more susceptible to blocks. These adjustments have successfully injected more strategy and action into special teams play, impacting game outcomes more frequently.</p>

Additionally, a route that allowed refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK will be permanently scrapped. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that settlement must be "earned by contributing to the country," with new conditions expected to include English language proficiency and a clean criminal record, aligning the rules for refugees with those for other migrants.</p>

          <p>A government supplier has claimed that dozens of hand-sewn American flags for Donald Trump's state visit to the UK had to be replaced because the U.S. embassy objected to the shade of red. The switch of 66 flags, which cost an estimated £52,800, was made because the standard red used was not the specific "cherry red" desired by American officials. This resulted in the Stars and Stripes having a brighter red than the Union flags flown alongside them during the ceremonial events on The Mall and at Windsor Castle.</p>
