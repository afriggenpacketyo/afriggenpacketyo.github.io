          <p>During the final performance of "Il trovatore" at London's Royal Opera House, a cast member displayed a large Palestinian flag on stage during the curtain call. An official attempted to take the flag, but the performer resisted, holding it for the remainder of the applause. The Royal Opera House condemned the unauthorized action, stating it was "completely inappropriate" and contrary to their commitment to political impartiality. The protest occurred amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, drawing significant attention from the audience and on social media.</p>

          <p>According to policy analysts, China has an opportunity to mitigate the effects of U.S. technology restrictions by fostering AI innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South. This strategy would involve promoting collaborative creation, equitable technology sharing, and the co-development of ethical AI frameworks that address diverse regional needs. By building inclusive AI infrastructure and ensuring fair data access, China could offer a compelling alternative to the U.S. strategy of supply chain decoupling. This approach aims to move beyond the direct rivalry with the U.S. and build new technological partnerships.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the widespread dissatisfaction with the American two-party system, highlighted by Elon Musk's proposal for a new political party. Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, explains that the current single-winner electoral system inherently marginalizes third parties, making them "spoilers" or "wasted votes." He argues that this structure has created a zero-sum political environment that is damaging American democracy. As a solution, Drutman advocates for proportional representation through multi-member districts, which he believes would make every vote more meaningful and reduce political polarization.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. tariffs have devastated Lesotho's garment industry, once known as the "Denim Capital of Africa," leading to factory closures and mass unemployment. The tariffs, imposed due to a trade imbalance, have undermined the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which previously granted tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Thousands of workers, many of whom are single mothers, are now jobless and facing hunger, with ripple effects impacting the entire local economy. The situation highlights the severe consequences of international trade policy on the livelihoods of people in developing nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Common Sense Media reveals that nearly three-quarters of American teenagers have used AI companions for activities like flirting, seeking advice, and general conversation. While over half use these tools regularly, the vast majority still prioritize and find more satisfaction in human friendships. The research raises concerns about privacy, as a quarter of teens have shared personal data, and the potential impact on social development during adolescence. Citing these risks, the nonprofit recommends that individuals under 18 should avoid using AI companions altogether.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." The government acknowledges the water sector is "broken" and plans tougher measures for non-compliant water company bosses, including potential prison sentences. This new target follows public outrage over record pollution levels and executive bonuses. While the plan aims to address a critical environmental issue, it rules out nationalization due to cost and will rely on a record £104 billion investment, likely leading to higher consumer water bills.</p>

Researchers found microscopic plant mineral deposits, known as phytoliths, inside the creature's stomach. The fossil also contained small quartz crystals, which were likely swallowed as "stomach stones" to help grind and digest tough plant matter, a practice seen in many modern birds and lizards. This discovery challenges previous assumptions and renews a debate among paleontologists, providing strong evidence that this particular species of pterosaur was herbivorous.</p>

The author, a teacher, notes that forgoing camp was a financial decision, just as sending kids to camp is a necessity for other working parents. The article suggests that the real issue is a societal structure that fails to support modern families, leaving mothers, in particular, to manage an immense mental load.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, astronomers have directly observed the earliest stages of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,370 light-years away. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in the star's protoplanetary disk. This process, occurring in a region analogous to our solar system's asteroid belt, provides an unprecedented look at the building blocks of planets like Earth. The discovery suggests that the mechanisms that formed our own planet could be a common process throughout the universe.</p>

          <p>Days of torrential rain have caused severe flooding and landslides across South Korea, resulting in at least 14 deaths and leaving 12 people missing. The southern and central regions of the country have been hit hardest, with an entire village in the Chungcheong region buried by a landslide. Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes, and extensive damage has been reported to roads, buildings, and farmland. As the heavy rain moves north towards the capital, Seoul, President Lee Jae-myung has ordered the worst-hit areas to be declared special disaster zones.</p>

Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to overcome barriers to the Chinese market to establish a more balanced trade relationship.

Her defense claimed it was a tragic accident, stemming from a goofy game where the couple mimicked cartoon characters. Linda asserted she believed the gun was unloaded after her husband said "No more buwwets" in an Elmer Fudd voice, before she attempted to "fan fire" the weapon. After an initial mistrial, a second jury convicted her of second-degree murder, unconvinced by the strange explanation for the fatal shooting.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Surrey and a Danish hospital reveals that nearly 44% of people using a hospital toilet do not wash their hands afterward. Researchers used sensors on toilets and sinks over 19 weeks and found that handwashing compliance was particularly low at the beginning and end of the day. Experts warn that this behavior poses a direct risk to patient safety by potentially spreading infections. They suggest that simple, well-timed reminders and clear messaging are needed to help form better and more consistent handwashing habits in hospital settings.</p>
