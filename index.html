          <p>A fire at the Gabriel House assisted living home in Fall River, Massachusetts, resulted in the deaths of nine residents and injuries to dozens more, including five firefighters. The fire broke out around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, with first responders encountering heavy flames and smoke. Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy," noting that over a dozen people were rescued by ladders. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, with state and local officials working to determine the origin and contributing factors, such as the functionality of the building's sprinkler system. The community mourns the loss and supports the affected families.</p>

          <p>Customs officials at Cologne Bonn airport in Germany discovered approximately 1,500 young tarantulas concealed within plastic containers inside chocolate sponge cake boxes shipped from Vietnam. The discovery was made three weeks prior after officials noticed an unusual smell emanating from the package. Many of the tarantulas did not survive the journey, raising concerns about violations of German animal welfare regulations. The surviving spiders have been placed in the care of an expert handler, and criminal proceedings are underway against the intended recipient for alleged customs and import duty violations.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated that the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, citing potential cause related to the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation project. The administration's criticisms of Powell have intensified, particularly regarding the renovation's budget overruns, despite the project being funded by the Fed itself. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has demanded answers about the renovation, suggesting the administration is building a case for Powell's removal. The Federal Reserve has quietly addressed some of Vought's concerns via its website.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, resulted in the deaths of two women and injuries to two men after a car chase involving a gunman who first shot a state trooper.

          <p>Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban affecting 1.1 million people across Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Wiltshire, set to begin on July 22. The decision is a response to prolonged dry weather and increasing demand that has strained water supplies. The ban restricts the use of hosepipes for activities like watering gardens and washing cars, with potential fines for violations. The Environment Agency has declared a state of prolonged dry weather in parts of the affected region, and Thames Water urges customers to conserve water. The GMB Union criticizes the ban, citing Thames Water's significant water leakage issues.</p>

          <p>A sex therapist identifies four surprising things that can quietly kill intimacy in relationships: phone use, unresolved feelings for an ex, negativity bias, and stress response. She emphasizes that intimacy is more than just sex and involves being open, honest, vulnerable, and real with a partner. The therapist suggests strategies such as setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and communicating stress responses. Small moments of closeness are key to maintaining intimacy. This involves a sex therapist's perspective on relationship dynamics.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers conducted their first tour of the new migrant detention facility, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' in the Everglades, following weeks of denied entry. Democratic lawmakers, who had been seeking the tour due to reports of "inhumane" conditions, described the facility as "appalling," noting smaller food portions for detainees and high temperatures in the medical area. Detainees have claimed limited access to water and inadequate food, while officials dispute these accounts. Republican lawmakers expressed satisfaction with the conditions they observed. Lawmakers plan to hold hearings on the facility and conduct an unannounced visit in the future.</p>

          <p>A BBC documentary about Gaza breached editorial guidelines on accuracy because it failed to disclose that the narrator was the son of a Hamas official. The BBC removed the program from its streaming service after the connection emerged. A review found that the independent production company, Hoyo Films, bore most of the responsibility for the failure, though the BBC also bore some responsibility. The review also found no evidence that the narrator's family influenced the content of the program. The BBC is taking steps to prevent similar breaches in the future.</p>

          <p>The article argues that true empathy involves more than simply sharing similar experiences; it requires deep listening and presence. Instead of saying 'I've been there, too,' the author suggests being present, using meaningful words or metaphors from the speaker, and being comfortable with silence. Asking 'Tell me more' allows the speaker to express themselves authentically and feel understood. The author emphasizes that transactional listening, focused on interrupting and explaining one's own ideas, hinders genuine connection. The author suggests that deeper connection leads to stronger relationships.</p>
