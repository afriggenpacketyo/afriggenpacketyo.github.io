          <h2>Justice Department Sues Colorado and Denver Over Sanctuary Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The suit argues that these policies, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities, interfere with the Trump Administration's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit specifically mentions an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, that President Trump claimed was controlled by a Venezuelan gang, alleging that Colorado's policies allowed this to happen. The suit seeks a court ruling that the state and city laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, but officials from Colorado have stated that they are not a 'sanctuary state' and will comply with any court rulings. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>The United States has implemented a 25% import tax on key car parts, including engines and transmissions, affecting the automotive industry. This tariff, intended to encourage domestic manufacturing, has raised concerns about higher costs for businesses and consumers. While companies have seen a temporary sales surge due to concerns about price increases, General Motors has warned of billions in new costs. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The expansion of this loophole previously allowed companies like Temu and Shein to thrive by offering goods directly from Chinese factories, fueled by billions in digital advertising. President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting these companies to tariffs up to 145%. Temu has reportedly stopped direct shipments from China, shifting to a local fulfillment model, and both Temu and Shein have reduced advertising spending on platforms like Google, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious plan for a national cathedral, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo allocated around $58 million of public funds to the $400 million project, which has now stalled, leaving behind a large hole in Accra. The project, intended to fulfill a personal pledge to God, faced criticism for its use of public funds during an economic crisis. The new government has halted funding and initiated an anticorruption investigation, dimming the prospects for the cathedral's completion.</p>

          <p>Two commercial flights had to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after an Army helicopter entered the airspace, which has restricted helicopter traffic since a fatal collision in January. Air traffic controllers instructed Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825 to abort their landings, and the FAA and NTSB have launched investigations. The helicopter, a Black Hawk, was headed to the Pentagon. This incident has sparked outrage and renewed concerns about military flights near the airport, with officials calling for improved civilian air safety.</p>
