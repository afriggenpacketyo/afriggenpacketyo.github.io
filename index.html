            <p>A new study by Chinese scientists reveals significant cadmium contamination in major rice-producing regions of South and Southeast Asia. Using machine learning to analyze soil samples, the research highlights the risk of kidney damage, bone disorders, and respiratory diseases for up to 1.4 billion people worldwide. The study, published in Science, raises concerns about global food security, particularly in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Thailand, where cadmium, a carcinogen, is prevalent in rice-growing areas.</p>

While many details were previously known, the release aims to fulfill Trump's promise of maximum transparency, although some redactions were made for privacy.

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the term "woman" legally refers to a biological woman, clarifying the definition within the Equality Act. This decision means that biological males, even with gender recognition certificates, cannot access women-only spaces. The ruling has drawn contrasting reactions, with some praising it as a victory for common sense and others criticizing it as devastating for trans rights. Detailed guidance is expected to follow, addressing practical implications for single-sex spaces and services.</p>

The strike, initiated by Unite union members over pay cuts, has resulted in 22,000 tonnes of uncollected waste, leading to increased rat infestations and public health concerns. Residents describe the situation as "absolute carnage," with some accusing the council of operating a two-tier waste collection system.</p>

            <p>The White House has redirected the COVID.gov website to a new page titled "Lab Leak: True Origins of COVID-19," promoting the theory that the virus originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China. The new site presents five points of evidence supporting the lab leak theory and criticizes government officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, for allegedly discrediting it. The page also questions the efficacy of social distancing and masking. The move reflects the Trump administration's stance on the origins of COVID-19.</p>
