            <p>Business owners and CEOs are already stocking up on inventory, and some American shoppers are panic buying big-ticket items in anticipation of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The sudden buying binge could cause an "artificially high" level of economic activity, said Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee. "Activity might look artificially high in the initial, and then by the summer, might fall off — because people have bought it all," he said. Sectors affected by Trump's tariffs, particularly the auto industry, are most likely to heavily stock up on inventory now before import levies on goods from other countries potentially rise further, said Goolsbee.</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes significant changes to the U.S. State Department, including closing embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order also suggests overhauling the selection and training of diplomats, emphasizing alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. The changes are intended to streamline operations and align the department with an "American First Strategic Doctrine." Secretary of State Rubio has denied the authenticity of the document.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is defending the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court – a notable contrast to his first term, when his administration sought to repeal the law in Congress and then refused to defend it in a major challenge brought by GOP-led states. But a win for the federal government in the current case, concerning the law’s mandates that certain preventive services are covered cost-free, could boost the power that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has in shaping those requirements. Cost sharing was an “enormous barrier” to people getting such care, according to Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p>
