        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is set to invest an additional $4 billion in Wisconsin for a second data center, complementing its initial $3.3 billion investment in a nearby Mount Pleasant facility slated to be operational by early 2026. The first data center will house a significant number of Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs to manage AI models, catering to the rising demand for cloud infrastructure. Microsoft aims to match its energy consumption with carbon-free energy sources, utilizing a solar farm under construction to contribute 250 megawatts of power. This expansion underscores Microsoft's commitment to AI development and sustainable energy practices, while also revitalizing land previously intended for a Foxconn plant. Optimism around this endeavor is tied to its potential for economic growth and technological advancement in the region. The project is expected to be completed in 2027 or later.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing debate in India surrounds dietary choices, influenced by Hindu nationalist groups promoting vegetarianism as a traditional Hindu value. This promotion often marginalizes meat consumption, associating it with religious minorities and lower-caste groups, leading to stigmatization and segregation. Despite this, a significant portion of the Indian population, including many Hindus, consumes meat, with dietary habits varying by region and caste. Urbanization is also driving dietary changes, with more young people embracing diverse foods, including meat, and a growing vegan movement challenging caste-based vegetarian norms. The conflict between traditional values and changing food habits continues to shape social norms and identities in India.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys general from 22 states and 254 organizations are opposing the Trump administration's proposed regulation that could narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The program allows non-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments. Critics argue that the proposed rule, stemming from an executive order, is unconstitutional, illegal, and harmful to millions of borrowers across the country. The executive order states that borrowers employed by organizations involved with "illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property and disruption of the public order" will not be eligible for PSLF. This opposition underscores concerns about fairness and access to debt relief for public servants.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis announced further cost-cutting measures, including a 25% reduction in capacity starting in November, and braced employees for more job cuts. The struggling discount airline is negotiating with vendors and aircraft lessors to reduce its fleet size and optimize its network. This move comes after the airline declared its second bankruptcy in less than a year, signaling ongoing financial instability. The airline has already announced furloughs and demotions of hundreds of pilots and voluntary unpaid leaves of absence for some flight attendants, with unions preparing to protect their members' interests.</p>

          <p>Planning approvals for new homes in England have fallen to a record low, with fewer than 29,000 projects granted permission in the year ending June 2025. This decline poses a challenge to the government's promise to deliver 1.5 million homes by the next election. While councils are approving a larger proportion of applications they handle, the overall number of decisions taken has fallen. The Housing Secretary has acknowledged the figures are unacceptable and pledged to address the issue, but housing market analysts suggest the government is trying to fix the wrong problem by trying to incentivize builders when there is not sufficient demand for new houses at current mortgage rates.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Holds Interest Rates Steady Amid Inflation Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK interest rates remain at 4% as the Bank of England signals that the country is "not out of the woods yet" regarding inflation. While analysts didn't expect a rate cut, given that prices are rising at nearly twice the Bank's target rate, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to cut rates to 3.75%. The Bank will reduce government debt holdings at a slower pace, and any further cuts will depend on evidence of easing price pressures. The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, stated that future cuts would need to be made gradually and carefully.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article critiques Keir Starmer's decision to host Donald Trump for a state visit in the UK, arguing that it normalizes a figure associated with divisive politics. It suggests the visit, occurring shortly after a large nationalist event in Britain, is a form of realpolitik gaslighting. The author expresses concern over the acceptance of unacceptable ideologies and the perceived inadequacy of elected officials in addressing these challenges. The piece emphasizes the need to confront hate and division, questioning whether current leaders are equipped to do so.</p>

          <p>Nobel laureate David Baltimore, who recently passed away, is being remembered for his significant contributions to the development of science in China. Over decades, he mentored Chinese researchers and advised on establishing top research institutions in the country. Scientists in China and Chinese-American researchers have acknowledged his role in strengthening China's scientific foundation and fostering international collaboration. His final paper was published in a Chinese journal, underscoring his commitment to the country's scientific advancement.</p>

          <p>The UK has deported its first migrant to France under the new "one in one out" agreement, with an Indian national being removed from the UK. The government is appealing a High Court decision to temporarily block the deportation of an Eritrean man on modern slavery grounds. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that the deportation sends a message to those crossing in small boats, that the UK will seek to remove them. The Home Office also said the first arrivals from France through the new asylum route are expected in the UK in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Two years after its launch, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), comprising Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, faces significant challenges. While conceived as a military defense pact, it has expanded its ambitions to political and economic integration, but economic conditions remain fragile and insecurity is escalating. Skepticism is particularly strong in Niger, where critics argue the government invests more in the AES than it gains. Security remains a major concern, as the promised joint military force still exists only on paper.</p>

          <p>Keely Hodgkinson, Great Britain's Olympic champion, made a successful start at the World Athletics Championships by progressing to the semi-finals of the women's 800m in Tokyo. Despite facing a 376-day wait to return to action due to hamstring tears, Hodgkinson controlled her heat to reach Friday's semi-finals. She is the gold-medal favorite, and secured back-to-back wins in her only two pre-championship races in August. Her training partner, Georgia Hunter Bell, will also be competing in the semi-finals, as the pair target a spectacular British one-two in the event.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Stability of Gender Identities in Younger Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 09:52:19 EDT</div>

          <p>This article discusses the evolving understanding of gender identity in young children, particularly focusing on those who have transitioned from one gender to another. In the early 2010s, the social transition of minors was still controversial, but a new perspective emerged suggesting that trans children possess a clear understanding of their identity. As a result, an increasing number of parents began supporting their young children's social transitions, sometimes as early as age three. The article will likely explore the long-term stability of these gender identities and the factors influencing them.</p>
