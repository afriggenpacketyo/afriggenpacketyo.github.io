          <p>A school shooting in Graz, Austria, resulted in multiple fatalities, according to the Austrian federal government. Police deployed special forces to the high school after receiving a call about the situation, with reports of shots fired at 10 a.m. local time. Austrian media outlets initially reported as many as five deaths, but officials did not immediately confirm the exact number of fatalities or injuries. The school was evacuated and thoroughly searched by security forces following the emergency alarm being triggered. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are still under investigation by the authorities, who are working to establish a clear overview of the incident. Optimism is low considering the tragedy of the event.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy conducted airstrikes on the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, targeting what it claimed were Houthi rebel group assets. The Houthis, who control the port, confirmed the strikes via their broadcaster, al-Masirah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz threatened Yemen with a naval and aerial blockade if the Houthis continued firing towards Israel. The Houthis have launched numerous drone and missile attacks towards Israel and international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, citing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza as their motive. The strikes and threats escalate tensions in the region amidst ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed accepting online orders after suspending them in April due to a significant cyber attack. Initially, the attack affected click and collect and contactless payments, leading to the suspension of online orders and warnings of continued disruptions until July. Shoppers can now purchase fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products and services to Northern Ireland expected to follow. The cyber attack is estimated to cost M&S around Â£300 million in profits this year, with some customer data potentially stolen, though payment details and passwords were not compromised.</p>

          <p>Houses were set on fire and police officers were injured in Ballymena, County Antrim, following a protest sparked by an alleged sexual assault. Masked individuals threw masonry and other projectiles at police, leading to a description of the violence as "unwanted and unwarranted" by the area's MP. Two teenage boys appeared in court accused of the sexual assault, with their solicitor stating they would deny the charges. Hundreds participated in a peaceful march earlier in the day before the violence erupted later that evening. This incident has raised community tensions in the area.</p>

          <p>Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles entered their fourth day, marked by escalating tensions and clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Thousands of protesters blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire, prompting police to use tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowds. The state of California has sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard without consulting Governor Gavin Newsom. Over 50 people have been arrested on charges including failure to disperse, arson, and looting, while officials debate the legality and necessity of the federal response.

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could cause foreign investors to withdraw from U.S. markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests the U.S. fund management industry, with approximately $18 trillion invested in U.S. stock markets, would be "collateral damage." Foreign investors hold substantial assets in U.S. equities, government bonds, and credit, making their potential withdrawal a significant concern. (not investment advice)</p>

Hegseth has defended the troop deployment on social media, stating it is necessary to protect federal immigration officers and buildings.

The announcement follows a two-year selection process and aligns with Britain's commitment to nuclear power. The government also pledged Â£14.2 billion to construct the Sizewell C power station in eastern England. Officials say the SMR plans could generate up to 3,000 jobs and power the equivalent of 3 million homes once connected to the grid in the mid-2030s.

A cliff inscription on the Tibetan Plateau, discovered in 2020, appears to chronicle a state-sponsored mission traveling west towards the mythical Mount Kunlun in 221 BC. The inscription explicitly mentions seeking the "elixir of life," potentially rewriting history.

          <p>China's restrictions on rare earth exports are impacting Western defense giants, particularly those reliant on critical minerals for advanced technologies. These restrictions, part of a response to U.S. tariffs, require firms to apply for licenses for the export of rare earths and magnets. The restrictions affect the production of items like F-35 fighter jets, which rely on samarium magnets. The U.S. and China are engaged in trade talks to de-escalate tensions over rare earth minerals, with potential for easing export controls if Beijing accelerates rare earth exports.

It questions whether cameras have ever truly captured objective reality, given the inherent biases in framing and perspective. The piece suggests that the increasing sophistication of AI-generated images is creating a "trust apocalypse," where distinguishing between authentic and synthetic visuals becomes increasingly difficult. The author argues that this shift requires a critical re-evaluation of our reliance on photographic evidence and the nature of truth in visual media.

          <p>Israel has begun deporting pro-Palestinian activists, including Greta Thunberg, after their Gaza-bound aid boat was seized in the Mediterranean. Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on a flight to France after agreeing to be deported. However, some French activists refused to sign their deportation orders and will be brought before an Israeli judicial authority. The activists were attempting to deliver aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's naval blockade. The incident has sparked criticism and debate over the legality and morality of the blockade.</p>

The announcement follows changes in UK government regulations regarding driverless cars. The government now aims to introduce an accelerated framework for small autonomous commercial services earlier than previously planned. The trial's specifics are still being determined, but Uber intends to add robotaxis as a regular option via its UK app once legislation permits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against academia, including efforts to bar international students from Harvard University, may undermine the United States' role as a magnet for global talent. Restrictions on international students could compromise the talent pool for US graduate schools, as about half of US STEM PhDs are conferred on international students. While overseas applications for graduate student or postdoctoral positions in the US from China and Europe are decreasing, more American students are exploring academic options abroad.

The release will consist of rice from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons. The government suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of price hikes.
