          <p>This article examines the intellectual underpinnings of Trumpian authoritarianism, arguing that a disconnect exists between right-wing intellectuals and the American public. It posits that conservatives in journalism and academia feel outnumbered, leading to the creation of insular spaces where they primarily interact with each other and often exaggerate the threat from the left. The article suggests that this warped view of the country is now influencing policy in areas like immigration, education, and foreign policy. The piece cites examples of right-wing figures now in top government positions who are focused on culture wars and dismantling institutions they view as leftist, such as universities.</p>

          <p>California Democrats initially killed and then resurrected a bill to crack down on buying teens for sex, highlighting divisions within the party on criminal justice reform. A freshman Democrat wrote legislation to make soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex an automatic felony, but Democratic colleagues demanded that the automatic felony part be dropped. After a backlash, a compromise was reached to make it an automatic felony if the buyer is more than three years older than the teen. The article explores the philosophical debate around decriminalizing sex work and the political implications of the issue.</p>

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that California's green energy policies are making energy unaffordable for residents.
