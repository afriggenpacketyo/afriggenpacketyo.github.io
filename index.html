          <h2>Analysis Suggests Manchester United's Player Selection, Not System, is Core Problem</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danny Murphy's analysis argues that Manchester United's recurring issues stem from player selection and misplacement within their 3-4-2-1 system, rather than the formation itself. Despite tactical improvements making the team more compact, individual errors, particularly from players like Bruno Fernandes in defensive roles, are costing them points. The article suggests manager Ruben Amorim must recognize these personnel shortcomings and adjust selections to prevent continued struggles, emphasizing that players need to be comfortable and effective in their assigned positions.</p>

          <p>A report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) indicates that Desmond Holly, the 16-year-old Colorado school shooter, was active on a "violent gore" website known for white supremacist content and graphic violence. This site, previously banned from Reddit, has been frequented by other school shooters, suggesting a pattern of online radicalization. Experts emphasize the need for better violence prevention funding and social-emotional learning programs to address concerning online behaviors and help individuals feel connected, preventing their engagement with such extremist platforms.</p>

          <p>China's Victory Day parade, attended by leaders like Russia's Putin and North Korea's Kim, served as a significant message primarily aimed at the Global South. The event projected an image of China as an alternative to Western partnerships, offering diplomatic legitimacy without requiring adherence to Western-dominated frameworks or reforms. This display aimed to reassure domestic audiences, signal limitations to Washington's sanctions, and present an "axis of the excluded" to middle powers seeking military development without Cold War entanglements.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has reportedly requested an additional $58 million from Congress for security services for executive and judicial branch members. This request comes amid a significant increase in political violence across the US, with over 520 plots and acts reported in the first half of 2025, a 40% rise from the previous year. House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized the critical need to protect public officials to ensure individuals continue to run for office.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles celebrated its 79th Mexican Independence Day parade with a renewed sense of defiance and pride, despite ongoing Trump administration immigration crackdowns and recent Supreme Court rulings expanding federal agents' detention powers. Attendees expressed fear over the raids, which target individuals based on appearance or language, but emphasized their commitment to fighting for rights and showing community solidarity. Mayor Karen Bass denounced the raids, while organizers decided to proceed with the traditional celebration, fostering a spirit of proud resistance against the backdrop of increased immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to attend NYU's D.C. program, staying close to his parents rather than the main Manhattan campus. This selective program combines coursework with internships focused on government, politics, and journalism. While Barron was previously studying at NYU Stern School of Business, his move to the D.C. program has sparked speculation about a potential shift towards a more political major, given his past involvement in his father's campaign.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with authorities and has not confessed. However, individuals close to Robinson, including his roommate and romantic partner who is transitioning from male to female, are fully cooperating. Cox confirmed that conversations on Discord, where Robinson allegedly joked about being the gunman, did occur. Formal charges, expected by Tuesday, will likely reveal more information as investigators work to determine the motive behind the targeted attack.</p>
