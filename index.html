          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, lost his appeal against a defamation judgment that found he committed war crimes. The original 2023 ruling stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true. Roberts-Smith, who maintains his innocence, sued three newspapers over articles alleging misconduct in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012. The civil trial, dubbed "the trial of the century," assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces for the first time, with a panel of judges upholding the initial verdict against Roberts-Smith.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their views, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives often file cases in Texas, ensuring rulings from Republican appointees, while liberals have favored the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions. Critics argue this erodes confidence in the courts, making judges appear as extensions of the political process. The Judicial Conference has recommended a random case-assignment policy to limit judge selection, but some districts have yet to fully adopt it.</p>

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, Cassie Ventura faced cross-examination, with defense attorneys using text messages to question her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities. The defense insists that Combs is innocent of the federal charges he's facing, arguing that while he has made mistakes, engaged in domestic violence and abused drugs, he never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade but testified that his personality changed over time, becoming prone to violence and jealousy. The trial continues with Ventura's testimony expected to conclude soon, given concerns about her pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, marking the first contraction in a year due to a decline in exports.

The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy, with only one rate hike anticipated later in the year, as uncertainties from global trade policies continue to pose risks to Japan's economic outlook.</p>

The event, which left traces in ancient trees and ice cores, was over 500 times more intense than the largest event of the modern satellite era. Researchers used a climate-chemistry model to confirm the storm's strength and timing, highlighting its significance for understanding the risks posed by future solar storms to modern infrastructure.

          <p>The Trump administration has struck deals with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to sell advanced AI chips, leading to internal divisions over whether the U.S. is outsourcing the industry of the future. The deals involve delivering Nvidia chips to build data centers in the Middle East, raising concerns about inadequate protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China. While some believe the deals will boost American AI companies, others worry that the world's biggest data centers will be located outside the U.S., potentially diminishing American influence in AI development.</p>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a megabill to enact President Trump's agenda, featuring tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, increased military spending, and stricter immigration enforcement. The bill proposes slashing health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs to offset costs. Key components include extending 2017 tax cuts, new tax breaks for businesses, and Medicaid work requirements. The bill faces internal divisions over Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deductions, with potential impacts on millions of Americans' health coverage and access to federal aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. The study found genetic exchanges between horse populations in both directions, with fossils from northeastern China showing mixed ancestry. These Dalianensis horses, which lived 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than existing wild horses. The findings highlight the dynamic movement and genetic interactions of horse populations across continents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Supreme Court justices took issue with Donald Trump’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship, in a trio of immigration cases that could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The cases stem from the president’s January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren’t citizens or permanent residents. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment. The court is mulling whether there is some weight to the justice department’s argument that “nationwide injunctions” often issued by federal judges unfairly tie the president’s hands.</p>

          <p>A military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary next month, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million.

The event, part of the Army's anniversary celebrations, has drawn criticism from Democrats who view it as a wasteful display of ego.

          <p>An audit of deaths in Maryland found that medical examiners often misclassified deaths occurring in police custody as accidental or natural, rather than homicides. At least 36 deaths should have been classified as homicides, with evidence of racism and pro-police bias influencing the decisions. The audit was prompted by the police killing of George Floyd and concerns about the testimony of Dr. David R. Fowler in the Derek Chauvin trial. The findings have prompted calls for further investigation and reforms in the medical examiner's office.</p>
