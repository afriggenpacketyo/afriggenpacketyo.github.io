            <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to cut interest rates and stating his "termination cannot come fast enough." Trump's remarks followed Powell's warnings about the potential consequences of the administration's trade war. The Fed has paused interest rate cuts due to persistent inflation, while Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, potentially leading to stagflation. Trump contrasted the Fed's stance with the European Central Bank's rate cut, highlighting his frustration with Powell's policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval ratings are declining, but the Republican Party has largely erased the Democratic advantage in representing the working class.

Democrats are struggling to capitalize on economic discontent and are facing challenges in reclaiming their position as champions of the working class. While Trump's popularity is declining, Democrats have not yet effectively taken advantage of the situation.</p>
