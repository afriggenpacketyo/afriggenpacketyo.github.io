            <p>The Library of Congress has added Vicente Fernández's rendition of 'El Rey' to the National Recording Registry, recognizing its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance to the United States. 'El Rey,' originally composed by José Alfredo Jiménez, gained immense popularity through Fernández's 1973 album, becoming a staple in mariachi music. The registry also includes Freddy Fender's 'Before the Next Teardrop Falls,' notable for its blend of English and Spanish lyrics, and segments in Spanish, highlighting its impact on cross-cultural appeal. The inclusion of these songs celebrates the contributions of Latino artists to American musical heritage and cultural diversity.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on punitive tariffs for most nations, but simultaneously increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, escalating the trade war between the two countries. Analysts warn that this 'tactical retreat' does not signal a change in Trump's overall objectives, and the world will likely face a higher tariff environment. Experts also expressed concern about the impact on global supply chains, with one analyst noting that the situation is 'chaotic' and 'crazy'. The situation could cause significant pain to China, the U.S., and other countries, with potential for significant disruption to trade and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The Daily Telegraph notes that US stocks bounced back after Trump's tariff pause, while the Daily Mail points out that the president has doubled down on China. The Financial Times questions the factors behind a bond sell-off, and the Guardian reports on market turmoil and recession warnings following Trump's actions. The Daily Express features Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch urging the prime minister to maximize Brexit freedoms in light of the global economic situation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With escalating tariffs between Beijing and Washington, diplomatic backchannels may be crucial in resolving the trade war. Despite raising tariffs on Chinese imports, President Trump indicated he doesn't foresee further increases and believes China desires a deal but struggles with the approach. Observers suggest diplomatic backchannels could play a significant role in facilitating negotiations, potentially serving as the only viable path forward. The ongoing tariff escalations highlight the increasing difficulty in reaching a resolution, emphasizing the need for creative diplomatic solutions to bridge the divide.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month in March, while producer price deflation deepened, signaling rising deflationary pressures amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The consumer price index slid 0.1% year-on-year, while producer prices fell 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Experts suggest a divergence between consumer and producer prices is likely, with exporters facing increased competition in a smaller global market. Despite these challenges, Chinese policymakers are prioritizing boosting domestic consumption and are expected to roll out further stimulus measures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate two senior officials from his first administration who have become critical of him. The targets are Miles Taylor, who wrote an anonymous op-ed and a tell-all book, and Christopher Krebs, Trump's former election security director. Trump fired Krebs in 2020 for correcting claims about voter fraud. During her confirmation hearing, Trump’s attorney general Pam Bondi assured that politics would not play a part in the investigation.</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson scrapped a planned vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint due to opposition from a subset of members. Johnson intends to try again before the House enters its April recess, aiming to resolve the issue. He spoke with President Trump, who is closely monitoring the situation, and expressed optimism about reaching a resolution. Some Republicans expressed frustration with the holdouts, while others emphasized their desire to support President Trump's agenda.</p>

            <p>A group of MPs is advocating for a streaming levy, suggesting that streaming services contribute 5% of their UK subscriber revenue to a fund supporting British high-end TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee emphasizes the importance of dramas like 'Adolescence' to the country's identity and talent pipeline. While streamers like Netflix and Amazon are valuable, the report suggests government intervention is needed to rebalance the playing field. The proposal aims to ensure the creation of distinctly British content and support the UK TV production workforce.</p>

Trump, unaware he was speaking to his former national security advisor, launched into a critique before realizing the error.

The incident occurred shortly after Trump publicly criticized McMaster and days before a separate incident involving a sensitive group chat.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices fell in March as a wave of tariff hikes from the US intensifies the trade war. The national consumer price index (CPI) dropped 0.1% year-on-year, reflecting the continued risk of deflation to the Chinese economy. Experts anticipate further downward pressure on prices due to the decline in American demand, leaving Chinese producers with unsold inventory. The Chinese government is expected to launch stimulus measures to boost domestic demand and mitigate deflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
