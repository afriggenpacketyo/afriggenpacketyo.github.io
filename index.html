          <h2>Trump Administration Advances Deep Seabed Mining Despite International Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 19:08:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing U.S. agencies to expedite permits for seabed mining in both U.S. and international waters, despite opposition from most other nations who consider international waters off-limits to such industrial activity. The order aims to establish the U.S. as a leader in seabed mineral exploration, potentially circumventing decades-old treaties. This move reflects the Trump administration's disregard for international institutions and is expected to provoke criticism from allies and rivals alike, prioritizing domestic resource development over global consensus. The order instructs NOAA to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. territorial waters.</p>

          <p>The climate activist group Just Stop Oil (JSO) is disbanding after three years of disruptive protests, citing increasingly stringent policing measures that have made their operations untenable. While JSO claims victory due to government policy aligning with their demand of no new oil and gas licenses, members privately acknowledge that new laws targeting disruptive protests have crippled their ability to function. The group's tactics, which included blocking roads and defacing art, drew significant public anger and prompted stricter legal measures, raising questions about the future of disruptive climate action in the UK. Some activists are now considering underground, less accountable forms of protest.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Russia's deadly attack on Kyiv, urging Putin to "STOP!" despite simultaneously pushing for a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Trump insisted that negotiations are progressing, even as the strikes undermine efforts to reach a settlement, which would involve recognizing Russian control over Crimea and other seized territories. While Trump has faced criticism for being too lenient towards Moscow, he maintains that his priority is saving lives and ending the conflict.

          <p>The son of New York Giants general manager Joe Schoen ignited speculation about the team's draft plans after sharing a video of Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart on social media.

The Giants have already addressed their quarterback situation by signing veterans Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson, but Schoen has stated that the team remains open to various options in the draft.

          <p>A bat infected with rabies was found near Rancho Santa Margarita Lake in Orange County, prompting health officials to issue a warning to the public.

Rabies is almost always fatal in humans once symptoms appear, making prompt medical attention after potential exposure critical. The virus is transmitted through saliva, often from bites, and bat bites can easily go unnoticed due to their small teeth.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, known as a "dirty line." This line lacks the firewall protections of the Defense Department's classified and unclassified systems, potentially making it vulnerable to monitoring, especially if sensitive information is communicated. The revelation has sparked controversy, particularly in light of Hegseth's previous denial of sharing classified war plans over Signal. A DOD spokesperson stated that Hegseth has never used Signal on his government computer, but did not address the use of the unsecured line.</p>

Crimo was not present for the sentencing hearing, and his attorneys presented no mitigating factors. The sentencing marks the end of a horrific chapter for the victims' families and the Highland Park community, who have shown remarkable resilience in the face of tragedy, and it makes it difficult for a future governor to give him clemency.</p>

The outbreak, which killed one person and sickened at least 88, was traced back to a single grower, but the FDA did not reveal the name because the contaminated lettuce was no longer being sold. The lawsuits allege that Taylor Farms originated the contaminated products, a claim the supplier denies.

          <p>Intel CFO David Zinsner stated that President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries have increased the likelihood of an economic slowdown and recession. While Intel reported better-than-expected first-quarter results due to some customers stockpiling chips, its guidance for revenue and profit fell below expectations, reflecting uncertainty caused by tariffs. The company anticipates that the total market for its chips could shrink if consumers reduce spending on new computers. Although Intel has some geographic diversification, it expects costs to increase due to the tariff environment. (not investment advice)</p>

One judge stated that the administration had not provided an adequately detailed definition of "diversity, equity and inclusion" and that the policy threatened free speech in the classroom.</p>
