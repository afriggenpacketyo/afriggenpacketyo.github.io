          <p>The Dutch Military Intelligence Agency (MIVD) has reported a thwarted Russian cyberattack targeting the digital control system of an undisclosed Dutch public facility, marking the first known Russian attack on the Netherlands' critical infrastructure. According to the annual report, Russia aims to destabilize society and gain control of systems by mapping infrastructure and conducting acts of sabotage, particularly in the North Sea targeting internet cables and energy supplies. The MIVD also reiterated that China continues to pose a serious threat to Europe through its backing of Moscow and cyber espionage activities, highlighting the increasing hybrid warfare tactics employed by Russia. The Netherlands is considered an "interesting target country" for Moscow due to its continued support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The White House has voiced strong support for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, despite reports that he shared sensitive military information on a Signal chat with family and friends. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the reports as a smear campaign, asserting that Hegseth is implementing significant changes at the Pentagon. Hegseth himself blamed "leakers" for the revelations, defending his communications as informal and unclassified, while also facing scrutiny for previously sharing details of military strikes in Yemen. The White House insists that nothing Hegseth shared on Signal was classified.</p>

          <p>Tesla short sellers have accumulated $11.5 billion in profits this year, as the company's stock price has declined significantly.

Tesla shares plummeted 36% in the first quarter, and the company is expected to report a slight decline in year-over-year revenue.

The order also calls for the FDA to open a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, clashing with planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

          <p>The article examines the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, despite a court order preventing his deportation to that country due to safety concerns. The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, but evidence linking him to the gang is reportedly weak. The author argues that the core issue is whether the government can bypass due process and whether it has to try to remedy the mistake it made in sending Abrego Garcia to a foreign prison. The author argues that the government does not have the authority to put people in prison without first proving — in court — that they are charging the right person and then convicting them of a crime.</p>
