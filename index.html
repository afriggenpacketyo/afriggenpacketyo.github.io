          <p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal agency supporting American museums and libraries, had nearly all its employees placed on administrative leave. This action follows President Trump's executive order mandating staff reduction to a "minimum presence."  The move has raised concerns about the future of grant funding and the potential for devastating impacts on cultural institutions across the United States.  A bipartisan group of senators has urged the administration to uphold its legal obligations to maintain IMLS funding and responsibilities.</p>
