          <p>China's export growth in May missed expectations, primarily due to a significant decline in shipments to the U.S., despite a temporary trade truce. Imports also experienced a sharp drop, reflecting sluggish domestic consumption, with exports rising 4.8% but imports plunging 3.4% year-over-year. Chinese exports to the U.S. fell by 34.5%, offset partially by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa. Renewed trade talks are anticipated in London between Chinese and U.S. officials amid lingering tensions over trade agreement violations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, resulting in numerous arrests and clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement.

          <p>A dispute between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles highlights differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. This 1878 law generally prohibits the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, with exceptions for congressional decree, insurrection, or state government inability to maintain order. Trump deployed the National Guard following reported attacks on ICE agents, while Newsom objected, calling the move a breach of state sovereignty.

Wind farms like Moray East and West are often forced to curtail production, receiving compensation payments because the grid lacks the capacity to transmit their electricity. At the same time, gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity, increasing costs and questioning the government's promise of cheaper electricity through net zero policies.
