          <p>Fintech company Block saw its shares increase after raising its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its future performance. The company reported a 14% rise in gross profit to $2.54 billion for the quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations, and now projects a full-year gross profit of $10.17 billion. Despite revenue falling slightly short of estimates, net income more than doubled compared to the same period last year. This positive forecast comes as Block navigates growing competition from rivals in the financial technology space and continues to expand its Square and Cash App services.</p>

          <p>A heated political exchange erupted after Democratic challenger Esther Kim Varet referred to Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., as an "ESL puppet" in a social media post criticizing her stance on immigration. Rep. Kim, a Korean American immigrant, responded by stating she is proud of her heritage and accent. Her campaign condemned the remarks as race-baiting and anti-immigrant slurs. The National Republican Campaign Committee labeled Kim Varet a "vile extremist," while she defended her comments as a critique of Rep.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court, seeking to pause a lower court's order that restricts certain immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California. A district judge had previously ruled that federal agents were violating the Fourth Amendment by detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Justice Department argues that this injunction interferes with law enforcement duties, contending that such factors, while not definitive, can heighten the likelihood that an individual is unlawfully present in the country.</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers are in stable condition after being shot in what officials are describing as an ambush in Susquehanna County. The troopers were responding to a welfare check involving gunshots when they were fired upon by a suspect armed with a rifle. The suspect was subsequently shot and killed by law enforcement, and there is no ongoing threat to the public. Governor Josh Shapiro and State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris praised the troopers for their bravery, noting they were "very lucky to be alive" following the attack.</p>

          <p>A brush fire in Ventura County, dubbed the Canyon fire, rapidly grew to over 400 acres, forcing evacuations in the Lake Piru Recreation Area and nearby communities. The fire broke out amid a severe heat wave, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees and strong wind gusts fueling its quick spread. Both Ventura and Los Angeles County fire departments are responding to the blaze, which has put parts of the Santa Clarita Valley on high alert. Officials are working to contain the fire under challenging weather conditions that could foster extreme fire behavior.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's homelessness minister following accusations of hypocrisy regarding a property she owns. Critics, including opposition politicians and tenant charities, called for her to step down after it was revealed she ended a tenancy to sell a house, only to re-list it for rent at a higher price. This action appears to contradict the spirit of the government's own Renters' Rights Bill, which she was helping to advance and which aims to prevent such practices. In her resignation letter, Ali stated she followed all legal requirements but was stepping down to avoid being a distraction.</p>

          <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has drawn sharp criticism from the scientific community after announcing that the Trump administration plans to review and "update" the nation's premier climate assessment reports. Scientists fear this move will inject political bias and misinformation into the rigorously peer-reviewed documents, which are considered the gold standard for climate science. Critics, including prominent climate scientist Michael Mann, have compared the action to authoritarian tactics of rewriting history. The Union of Concerned Scientists warned that this could replace scientific evidence with lies, leaving people more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order designed to make it easier to include alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans.

While proponents argue this could offer higher returns, critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have raised serious concerns about exposing retirement funds to the high risks, volatility, and lack of regulation inherent in such speculative assets.

          <p>An event in the Oval Office, which the White House had promoted as a "major announcement on the economy," turned into a presentation by conservative economist Stephen Moore praising President Trump's first-term economic record. Instead of a policy announcement, reporters witnessed Moore use charts to claim that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had been incompetent or biased against Trump. The bizarre event occurred on the same day that new, sweeping tariffs on global imports ordered by the president took effect, raising concerns among businesses and consumers about potential price hikes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Stephen Miran, the current chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, to serve on the Federal Reserve's board of governors. The temporary appointment, which would fill a vacancy until January 2026, requires Senate confirmation. Miran is known as a critic of the Fed's recent policies and a proponent of lower interest rates, aligning with the president's public pressure on the central bank. His nomination is seen as a move to place an influential dissenting voice on the board that sets the nation's monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth look at the political conflict in Texas, where Democratic state lawmakers fled to prevent Republicans from passing a new congressional map designed to add five GOP seats. It explains the tactic of a "quorum break," its historical precedents, and the unprecedented response from Republican leaders threatening arrests and seat vacancies. The piece highlights the national implications, suggesting that the showdown in Texas is a testing ground that could lead to a nationwide "redistricting arms race" as other states consider similar partisan maneuvers ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted a 14-day temporary restraining order, pausing all further construction at the controversial immigrant detention center known as "Alligator Alcatraz" in the Florida Everglades. The ruling does not affect current detainees but addresses a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility was built without required environmental impact studies. The plaintiffs contend the project threatens a sensitive ecosystem, protected species, and sacred tribal lands. This order provides a temporary victory for opponents while the court considers a more permanent injunction.</p>
