            <h2>Children's Commissioner Advocates for Head Teacher Discretion on Phone Bans</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 03:10:02 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes decisions regarding phone bans in schools should be made by head teachers, not mandated by the government. A survey indicates that most schools already restrict phone use, but Dame Rachel emphasizes the need for parental support in managing children's screen time at home, noting that children are spending excessive hours on devices outside of school. She advocates for technology companies to prioritize online safety and for schools to educate students about online risks, while supporting head teachers who choose to ban phones, basing the decision on their understanding of their students' needs. The report also suggests further research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's phone use, especially regarding social media.</p>

            <p>Stock markets globally rallied on Thursday after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on planned tariffs for most American trading partners, excluding China, providing a reprieve after a week of market turbulence. Asian indices, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi, saw significant recoveries, while U.S. markets also rebounded strongly following the announcement. Despite the tariff pause, Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods, citing a "lack of respect" from Beijing, after China announced reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods. The market's positive reaction suggests investors are hopeful for trade negotiations and a de-escalation of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Paul Mullin, Wrexham's star striker, has faced a challenging season due to back surgery and the arrival of new, high-profile players. After recovering from back surgery, Mullin has struggled to regain his form, with limited starts and a poorer goal-scoring record compared to previous seasons. The recent signings of Jay Rodriguez and Sam Smith, both starting regularly, have further reduced Mullin's opportunities, leaving him with limited playing time and a spot on the bench. Despite his past achievements, manager Phil Parkinson prioritizes current performance, leading to Mullin's reduced role in the team.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month in March, while producer price deflation deepened, as the country braces for escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The consumer price index slid 0.1% year-on-year, while producer prices fell 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Despite these deflationary pressures, core inflation rose slightly, signaling a potential divergence between consumer and producer prices. Experts anticipate further policy stimulus aimed at boosting domestic consumption to counteract the impact of rising tariffs and external demand uncertainties.</p>

            <p>While President Trump has paused tariffs on most nations, analysts warn that the market chaos will continue to impact the UK and beyond, particularly with a 10% tariff remaining on all US exports except for China, which faces a 125% tariff. The tariffs threaten to disrupt global finance and the economy, potentially leading to falling global growth, soaring inflation, and stock market listing delays. Some experts suggest US inflation could peak at 4.5% next year if tariffs remain in place, increasing the chances of a US recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown urges world leaders to form an "economic coalition of the willing" to address the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs through coordinated economic policies, including interest rate reductions. He suggests the UK should strengthen ties with the EU and create a Europe-wide defense and security fund. Brown emphasizes the need for international cooperation to safeguard jobs and living standards amid a breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders. He also cautions against China flooding global markets and calls for a focus on expanding domestic consumption.</p>

            <p>Analysts view President Trump's 90-day tariff pause as a "tactical retreat" rather than a shift in his overall trade objectives, emphasizing that the world's two largest economies remain locked in a dangerous trade war. Despite the pause on tariffs for most nations, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to 125%, intensifying the rift between Beijing and Washington. Experts express concern over the impact of these actions on global supply chains, warning of potential disruptions and economic pain for multiple countries. A report by ING noted that the current situation is not only chaotic but also "crazy."</p>
