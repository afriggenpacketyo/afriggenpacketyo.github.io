            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CEO C.C. Wei has denied reports of active discussions with Intel regarding a chipmaking joint venture, dispelling rumors of a collaboration between the two semiconductor giants. This denial comes as President Trump pushes to reshore manufacturing in the U.S. through tariffs. TSMC reported a profit beat for the first quarter due to demand for AI chips but faces potential headwinds from tariffs and export controls. The Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation into semiconductor imports, potentially leading to new tariffs for the chip industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision comes as U.S. consumers are expected to face higher prices on various goods, from electronics to cars, due to the biting impact of tariffs.

            <p>The Trump administration has threatened to ban Harvard University from enrolling foreign students after the institution refused to comply with demands to change hiring, admissions, and teaching practices to combat antisemitism. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requested records on the activities of foreign student visa-holders, leading to Harvard's potential loss of the "privilege of enrolling foreign students." This action follows a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal funding and threats to revoke Harvard's tax exemption, as the administration targets universities where pro-Palestinian protests have occurred. Harvard maintains it will not surrender its independence or constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements have resulted in a decline in public support, particularly concerning his economic stewardship. Polling indicates that his chaotic trade policy has eroded trust, leading to tanking economic approval ratings and a slide in overall popularity. The public perceives Trump as unable to lower prices or slow down inflation, and expectations that tariffs will only raise prices and harm the national economy are accelerating this decline. Despite these warning signs, there is resilient trust in Trump, with many still viewing him and the GOP as better suited to advocate for the working class.</p>

The book examines the impact of these changes on his parents' psyches and his own life, as the alignment between their values and the movies fractured.

            <p>Uncertainty surrounding import tariffs is creating challenges for home builders and real estate developers in Southern California, including those rebuilding after the January wildfires. Builders are struggling to budget for rising costs of construction materials and appliances, particularly those made or manufactured in China. This is forcing contractors to make quick purchasing decisions and prepare customers for higher costs. Concerns extend to labor shortages due to immigration policies, further complicating the construction landscape.</p>

            <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are facing a resentencing hearing that could offer them their first chance at freedom in over 35 years. Defense attorney Mark Geragos will argue for a reduced sentence, citing years of alleged sexual abuse by their father. The current District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, opposes their release, questioning the validity of their self-defense claims. The hearing is expected to last two days, and if resentenced, the brothers could be eligible for parole.</p>

            <p>Southern California home prices experienced minimal growth last month, with a 0.38% increase, due to factors like high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty. Economists cite rising inventory and concerns over Trump administration tariffs as contributing factors. Zillow forecasts a 2.4% decrease in home prices in the L.A.-Orange County metro area by March 2026. Rising rents in areas affected by the January fires may offset the overall downward trend.</p>

This move, along with potential order deferrals from other airlines, highlights the economic impact of the trade war. Boeing, as the biggest exporter in the U.S., is especially susceptible to the chaos created by Trump's trade policies, which lack coherence and fail to achieve stated goals.

            <p>Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Vietnam is causing concern in Little Saigon, where businesses rely on affordable goods imported from the country. While some older Vietnamese immigrants, with strong anti-Communist sentiments, are willing to pay higher prices if it hurts the Vietnamese government, others worry about the impact on consumers. The situation highlights a generational divide, with younger Vietnamese Americans concerned about the economic impact of tariffs on their community. The Vietnamese American Chamber of Commerce is working to provide information and calm fears among its members.</p>

            <p>Stock analysts warn that Walt Disney Co.'s theme parks could be negatively affected by trade tensions and tariff-fueled recession fears. Amusement park attendance is typically tied to the health of the American economy, and declining consumer sentiment may impact future bookings. Decreased international tourism, driven by anti-American sentiment, could also hurt Disney's parks, which rely on international visitors for a significant portion of their revenue. The theme parks are a key component of Disney's overall finances, contributing nearly 60% of the company's operating income last year.</p>

While not a cure, stem cells could offer new hope to patients, including those no longer responding to drug treatment.</p>
