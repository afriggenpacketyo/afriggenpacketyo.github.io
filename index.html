          <p>Gaming powerhouse Electronic Arts (EA) has been acquired for $55 billion by a consortium including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. This all-cash deal, valuing shares at $210, marks the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history, taking EA private. Industry experts express significant anxiety over the $20 billion debt financing, fearing it could severely impact EA's ability to invest in new games and potentially lead to further corporate cuts. The acquisition significantly expands Saudi Arabia's growing presence in the gaming sector, adding EA to its portfolio of major industry stakes and raising human rights concerns.

          <p>Sir Terry Farrell, a prominent British architect celebrated for his exuberant post-modernist designs, has passed away at the age of 87. His architecture practice, Farrells, announced his death, acknowledging his significant influence on urbanism and his reputation as a "maverick." His most famous commissions include London's iconic MI6 headquarters, prominently featured in James Bond films, and the distinctive TV-am building, known for its playful giant breakfast eggcups on the roof. Farrell's career saw him intentionally diverge from minimalist trends, embracing color and witty historical references, while also championing innovation and environmental awareness in building design.</p>

Fans appreciate his stoic pessimism and constant desire for peace amidst absurd adventures, with his backstory revealing a failed mascot career and unrequited love for a baguette.

          <p>With gold prices surging to an all-time high of $3,800 per ounce, experts are now offering detailed advice on how investors can strategically sell their gold for a profit. This price uptick is largely attributed to gold's established role as a safe haven and a hedge against ongoing economic uncertainty, persistent inflation, and rising geopolitical tensions. Investors are advised to carefully evaluate the current market timing, thoroughly review their specific gold investments—whether physical bullion, ETFs, or stocks—compare various selling options, and diligently research potential tax implications. While securing profits now is appealing, some analysts suggest gold's price may still have room to run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal, Ordnance Industry Science Technology, has provided extensive details on the Liaoyuan-1 (LY-1) shipborne laser weapon, which was prominently showcased at the country’s recent Victory Day parade in Beijing. The article asserts that the LY-1, specifically designed for close-range interception of incoming missiles and drones as a crucial "last line of defence," significantly surpasses American counterparts like the Helios in terms of overall robustness and advanced subsystems. It highlights the LY-1's notably larger lens aperture, nearly twice the diameter of the Helios', and its more advanced auxiliary equipment and sensors. This development signals China's substantial advancements in military laser technology, potentially enhancing its naval air-defence capabilities.</p>

          <p>A horrific attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulted in four fatalities and eight injuries after a gunman drove into the building, opened fire with an assault-style rifle, and set it ablaze during a Sunday service. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran, was shot dead by police at the scene within minutes. The FBI is now leading the investigation into what it deems an "act of targeted violence," with authorities still working to determine a motive and the exact origin of the fire, which involved an accelerant. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered US and state flags lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor the victims of this tragic event.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack stated that the US central bank faces a "challenging time" attempting to balance persistent inflation control with protecting jobs. She expressed ongoing worry about inflation, which has exceeded the Fed's 2% target for over 4.5 years, noting particular pressure in the services sector. Despite a recent rate cut, Hammack believes the Fed needs to actively maintain a restrictive policy stance to bring inflation back to its goal, not expecting prices to fall to 2% until late 2027 or early 2028.

This support occurred even months after federal investigations into Aspiration's actions had reportedly begun. This timeline casts considerable doubt on Ballmer's assertions of being defrauded and adds further complexity to the NBA's reopened investigation into Leonard's 2019 free agency.</p>

          <p>The US electric vehicle (EV) market is entering a period of significant uncertainty as federal incentives of up to $7,500 are set to be discontinued after Tuesday, which will likely reveal the true "natural demand" for EVs. Automakers, who have heavily relied on these incentives to boost sales and justify billions in development costs, anticipate a "boom-and-bust" situation before a new market normal is established. Industry leaders like GM, Hyundai, and Tesla expect a precipitous drop in demand in the coming months, leading some manufacturers to cut production, lay off workers, or eliminate models. Despite recording an all-time high in EV sales in the third quarter, the market faces considerable headwinds without government support.</p>

          <p>A stress physiologist, drawing from 20 years of research involving over 750 Americans, argues that conventional stress management advice often overlooks a crucial element: channeling stress energy outward to help others. This approach, termed "stress springboarding," leverages the body's release of oxytocin, often called the "cuddle hormone," which inherently motivates connection and seeking support, suggesting stress is fundamentally a social experience. Instead of retreating inward, the article recommends using stress as fuel for meaningful action, such as assisting colleagues, supporting friends, or volunteering for community causes. Brain imaging studies support this, showing that helping others activates reward centers and reduces activity in stress-related regions, leading to more effective long-term stress handling.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is partnering with US-based Firebird and the Armenian government to launch a $500 million AI factory next year, a development poised to significantly boost local tech talent and the country's economy. This state-of-the-art facility, which will utilize thousands of Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, is expected to become a powerful generator for basic research and new companies, positioning Armenia as a key player on the global technology stage. Experts highlight the factory's potential to bridge the digital divide for countries with fewer resources, especially as it will tap into Armenia's surplus nuclear power supply. Local educational programs are already actively preparing young Armenians for future AI careers.</p>

          <p>A financial therapist is strongly warning against relying solely on "manifesting" for financial success, emphatically stating that "delulu is not a solulu." While a positive belief system and visualization can be a constructive starting point, concrete action is absolutely imperative for achieving tangible financial goals like saving for retirement, making a down payment on a home, or paying off substantial debt. The belief that positive thinking alone can make things happen is particularly popular among younger Americans on platforms like TikTok. Experts explain that perceived successes from manifesting often stem from confirmation bias, emphasizing that real change requires proactive steps and a robust financial plan alongside an abundance mindset.

Rowling criticized Watson's perceived lack of "real life" experience due to wealth and fame, contrasting it with her own struggles and understanding of women's rights.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance announced that the White House is actively considering Ukraine's urgent request for long-range Tomahawk missiles to significantly bolster its defense capabilities against Russian forces. This potential sale aligns with the Trump administration's policy of having European NATO countries fund such weapons, a deal struck earlier in the summer. The Tomahawk missile, boasting a range of approximately 1,500 miles, would place Moscow well within Ukraine's strike capability, a prospect that has understandably drawn strong concern from the Kremlin, which implied direct US interference. The US is encouraging European allies to increase their investment in the conflict and the ongoing peace process, amidst intensified Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine.</p>
