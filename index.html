          <p>A recent study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry indicates that lifestyle choices can significantly lower the risk of dementia, stroke, and late-life depression. The study, led by Dr. Sanjula Singh, highlights that modifiable risk factors account for a substantial percentage of these conditions, specifically 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia, and 35% of late-life depression. Experts recommend focusing on key practices to stave off these brain conditions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of stroke, depression, and dementia, where one condition can increase the likelihood of developing the others. Prioritizing brain health through lifestyle adjustments can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling later life.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett criticized protectionist trade policies at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, cautioning against using trade as a weapon. He emphasized that global prosperity benefits the United States and advocated for countries to specialize in their strengths to foster mutual growth. Buffett highlighted the potential long-term negative consequences of tariffs and protectionism, especially considering the United States' position as a leading industrial nation. Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter earnings report noted "considerable uncertainty" due to tariffs and geopolitical events, and Buffett has been defensively selling stocks, increasing Berkshire's cash reserves to a record $347 billion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are challenging President Trump's claims that grocery and gas prices are falling, asserting that federal data indicates otherwise. While overall inflation has slightly eased during Trump's term, prices for essential goods continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace. Specifically, grocery prices have increased, and gas prices have remained relatively flat since Trump took office, contradicting his assertions of price reductions. Experts suggest that the drop in oil prices, while potentially leading to lower gas prices in the future, reflects expectations of an economic slowdown, which is not necessarily a positive indicator of Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the six most common anxieties in children that parents often underestimate: social dynamics, social media, life changes, over-scheduling, inconsistency, and trauma. Children are increasingly worried about fitting in, social media comparisons, and changes in their routines or family structures. Trauma, even from seemingly small incidents, can significantly impact a child's sense of safety. The therapists recommend teaching children coping strategies like naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, using affirming phrases, and scheduling a 'worry window' to manage their anxieties effectively.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive term as Australian Prime Minister, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian leader has achieved this milestone. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging the Labor Party's historic win. Albanese emphasized his government's improved relations with China and criticized the opposition's adoption of "American-style politics" focused on division. The election took place against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with both parties promising policies to assist first-home buyers and address the country's changing demographics.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to return to the airwaves after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked an executive order by President Trump that sought to dismantle the broadcaster. The court's decision allows VoA to resume broadcasting while the legal challenge proceeds, restoring access to government email accounts and enabling a phased return to the office for staff. However, the ruling is less favorable for other publicly funded broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as the freeze on their congressionally approved funds remains in effect, leading to staffing cuts and content reductions.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has achieved its first local council control in 10 areas following recent elections, with plans to implement efficiency measures inspired by Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion, as the conglomerate warned that tariffs may further impact profits.

Additionally, the company suffered a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange due to the dollar losing value.

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to El Salvador and paying for their imprisonment, without convicting them of any crime, is facing scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. El Salvador's prison system is known for its harsh conditions, raising concerns about the treatment of deportees. While deportation alone is not considered punishment under the Eighth Amendment, the administration's actions of paying for incarceration in a brutal prison system raises questions about whether this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Some legal experts argue that the government cannot circumvent the Bill of Rights by skipping trials and sentences, suggesting the Supreme Court should clarify the protection of Eighth Amendment rights in such cases.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett criticized President Trump's trade policies at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, stating that "trade should not be a weapon." He acknowledged that he had previously proposed ideas to address trade imbalances, but he defended the broader concept of global trade flows, advocating for countries to specialize in their strengths. Berkshire Hathaway warned that Trump's trade policies were generating "considerable uncertainty," which could affect the company's operating results. Despite these concerns, Berkshire's cash hoard continued to grow as Buffett found few attractive opportunities for major acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has called the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act “unlawful,” joining other judges who have ruled against the president. This resistance from the judiciary stands in contrast to other institutions that have been absent or in retreat during Trump's second term. The judiciary is stepping in to provide a check on the executive branch. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed this and more.</p>

Social connection and community is important for human well-being because it aids in the process of finding meaning and feeling that one’s life has purpose. Young people are facing a series of roadblocks to finding that meaning. The path to a better life might come down to incorporating a few basic principles, Brooks argues: “Put close relationships with family and friends before virtually everything else.”</p>
