            <p>President Trump met with Italy's Giorgia Meloni at the White House amidst ongoing tariff disputes with the European Union. The meeting occurred a day after discussions with Japanese officials and a conversation with Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, signaling widespread interest in tariff negotiations. Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, expressing impatience for his "termination" due to concerns about inflation and economic growth stemming from tariff policies. While the meeting aims to address trade, defense, and other issues, tensions remain high regarding the impact of tariffs on the global economy.</p>

            <p>Astronomers have detected promising "hints" of potential life on the distant planet K2-18b, located 124 light-years away. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers found signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide, chemicals on Earth produced primarily by microscopic marine algae. While emphasizing caution, the researchers suggest that the concentration of DMS on K2-18b appears significantly stronger than on Earth, potentially indicating a biological origin. K2-18b is a rare exoplanet within the habitable zone, making it a prime candidate for further investigation into the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

            <p>A recent Pew Research Center survey indicates a softening of American attitudes towards China, marking the first decline in negative views in five years. While overall attitudes remain predominantly unfavorable at 77%, the percentage of Americans with "very unfavorable" views decreased by 10 points from the previous year. Now, only a third of Americans consider China an "enemy," compared to 42% last year, despite ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical competition. The survey, conducted after Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, suggests a potential shift in public sentiment, though further developments could influence future attitudes.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly's stock surged after positive data emerged from a trial of its oral obesity pill, orforglipron, which showed promising results in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The pill demonstrated similar safety and efficacy to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, a leading injectable drug in the same class. Analysts view weight-loss pills as a significant new frontier in the rapidly expanding obesity market. Eli Lilly is strategically stockpiling orforglipron inventory, which could enable a swift launch upon regulatory approval, potentially solidifying its position in the weight loss market.

            <p>The Trump administration is threatening to ban Harvard University from enrolling foreign students after the institution refused to comply with demands to alter hiring, admissions, and teaching practices related to antisemitism. The White House has also frozen billions in federal funding and threatened to remove Harvard's tax exemption. Harvard has rejected the demands, asserting its independence and constitutional rights. The administration's actions are part of a broader crackdown on universities where pro-Palestinian protests have taken place.</p>

            <p>The Texas House approved a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition. The bill, passed after nearly 11 hours of debate, will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions. Under the bill, students will receive $10,000 each year if they attend a private school, with additional funds for disabled and home-schooled students. Democrats criticized the bill as "welfare for the rich" and expressed concerns about its impact on public school funding.</p>

            <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that his "termination cannot come fast enough" and calling for interest rate cuts. Trump's comments follow Powell's warnings about the potential consequences of the administration's trade war. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank's rate cuts as justification for his stance. Despite Trump's criticism, Powell has defended the Fed's independence and stated that presidents do not have the authority to fire or demote the Fed chair.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop after the company lowered its annual profit forecast, citing higher-than-expected medical costs in its Medicare Advantage plans. This development raises concerns for other insurers with similar plans, as it signals potentially accelerating medical costs. Analysts suggest that companies with greater market share in Medicare Advantage may be more affected. The rise in care utilization is attributed to seniors returning for procedures delayed during the pandemic and potential changes in the company's utilization management practices.

It raises concerns that Trump may attempt to install a loyalist at the Federal Reserve, similar to his actions with the FBI, undermining the Fed's independence.</p>

BDO USA implemented an ESOP and saw a decrease in turnover and increased engagement.

His apparent failure to disclose these appearances to the Senate committee adds to the concerns.

The CDC acknowledges that improved screening and access to services may contribute to the rise in diagnoses. Experts also note that the definition of autism has expanded.
