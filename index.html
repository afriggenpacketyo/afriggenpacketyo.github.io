          <p>The Trump administration plans to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This move comes amid plummeting relations between Beijing and Washington, fueled by a tit-for-tat trade war. China has firmly opposed the decision, urging the U.S. to safeguard the legitimate rights of international students. Criteria will also be revised to enhance scrutiny of future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong, causing anxiety among Chinese students and potentially leading to reprisal from China.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies.

The court emphasized that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations.

Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, an all-time high for April. Despite the positive sales figures, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen.

          <p>President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing, potentially putting the country on a collision course with the Trump administration's trade objectives. Xi emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as the "backbone" of China's economy during a visit to Henan province. While China's manufacturing sector contributed over 25% of its GDP in 2023, this push could conflict with U.S. demands to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies. Experts suggest there is little room for China to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, anticipating continued trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
