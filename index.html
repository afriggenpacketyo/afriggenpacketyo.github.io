          <p>This article analyzes China's vulnerability in the ongoing trade war with the United States, focusing on the risk of significant job losses due to tariffs and economic struggles. China's economy is currently battling a property slowdown and high youth unemployment, making it more susceptible to economic hardship. The article notes that while a temporary reduction in tariffs has been agreed upon, a full resumption of the trade war could lead to millions of manufacturing job losses in China. The United States also faces vulnerabilities, including dependence on China for rare earth metals and the risk of inflation due to shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Han Song, a prominent Chinese science fiction writer and journalist, explores the disorienting effects of China's rapid modernization in his works, often depicting dark and unsettling scenarios that eerily mirror real-world events. The article highlights his stories' bleak and grotesque nature, scrutinizing the gap between China and the West and imagining China as a global superpower. Facing declining health, Han Song has shifted his focus inward, documenting his personal struggles with dementia on social media. While the Chinese government promotes science fiction as a symbol of technological advancement, Han Song's work often reflects ambivalence about China's place in the world.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a second consecutive month of growth in April, despite the impact of U.S. tariffs and persistent deflationary pressures. The National Bureau of Statistics reported a 3% increase in cumulative profits at major industrial firms compared to the previous year, bolstered by strong earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. While U.S. tariffs have impacted certain industries like automobiles and apparel, overall exports have found alternative markets. The government is implementing measures to stabilize employment, particularly for exporters, but analysts caution that challenges such as insufficient demand and declining prices persist.

          <p>A recent study found that some beers brewed in the U.S. contain high levels of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," exceeding the EPA's allowed limits. The research, conducted by the ACS’ Environmental Science & Technology, discovered a strong correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and levels in locally brewed beer. Beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had elevated levels of PFAS. The study found that 95% of the beer tested contained perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid, two forever chemicals with recently established EPA limits in drinking water.</p>

The Finance Ministry reported that Japan's gross external assets increased by 12.9% year-on-year, reaching 533.05 trillion yen, though this was still below Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation has boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany has benefited from a large current account surplus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the country, citing antisemitism at Harvard. This announcement follows previous actions by the Trump administration to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard and its research partners. The president also accused Harvard of being slow to provide information on foreign student lists. The university is currently engaged in legal battles with the White House over funding and the right to admit international students.</p>

          <p>A Canadian man has been sentenced to almost two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Winston Churchill, known as "The Roaring Lion," from Ottawa's Château Laurier hotel. Jeffrey Wood pleaded guilty to stealing the original print and committing forgery. The photograph, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, is featured on the UK £5 note. Wood claimed he stole the photo to get money for his brother, who was suffering from mental health problems. The judge emphasized the breach of trust in stealing such a culturally significant item.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives advanced a bill that would cut in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the current frenzy of wealthy individuals buying teams. Currently, owners can write off the full value of intangible assets like player contracts over 15 years. The proposed change would allow deductions for only half the value, potentially cooling demand for teams and affecting current owners. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this change would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years, although team owners argue the figure is much higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bill Saporito argues that President Trump is asking retailers like Walmart to ignore fundamental business principles by absorbing the cost of tariffs instead of raising prices. Trump's demand that retailers "eat the tariffs" clashes with the reality that expenses exceeding revenue can lead to business failures. The author contends that businesses are afraid to acknowledge the reality of tariffs due to fear of enraging the administration, and this denial of economic realities is self-defeating. The article highlights the complexities of supply chains and the impact of tariffs on various industries.</p>
