          <p>Japan's far-right Sanseito party, running on a "Japanese First" platform, made significant gains in the recent upper house election, becoming the third-largest opposition party. Led by Sohei Kamiya, the party capitalized on public discontent with traditional politics, using social media to promote nationalist values, tax cuts, and anti-immigration rhetoric. Founded in 2020, Sanseito has been criticized for spreading conspiracy theories and employing xenophobic language, drawing comparisons to far-right movements in the U.S. and Europe. The party's increased presence in parliament raises concerns among critics about the potential for discriminatory rhetoric to become more accepted in mainstream Japanese society.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia under the UK's National Security Act. Phillips offered to provide personal information about a former defense secretary to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents, who were actually undercover British officers. Described by his ex-wife as being "infatuated" with espionage, Phillips communicated with the agents via WhatsApp and provided a USB stick with a document offering his "100% loyalty and dedication." He was arrested in May 2024 after a meeting with one of the undercover officers near King's Cross station in London.</p>

          <p>A man in Bradford, UK, has been sentenced to life with a minimum of 28 years in prison for the murder of his wife, Kulsuma Akter. The attack, which involved stabbing her 26 times, occurred in public while she was pushing their seven-month-old baby in a pram. Habibur Masum had stalked his wife after she moved to a refuge to escape his domestic abuse, and the court heard he showed no remorse after the brutal killing. The judge described the attack as "vicious and merciless," highlighting the deliberate and unsurvivable nature of the wounds he inflicted.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests the European Union has an opportunity to enhance its strategic position by pragmatically negotiating with China, especially as it faces tariff threats from the United States. With the U.S. potentially imposing harsh tariffs, the EU can leverage its relationship with China to improve its bargaining power. The author argues that the EU must understand China's perspective, particularly its strategic reliance on Russia as a counterweight to the U.S., and questions the fairness of expecting China to pressure Moscow over Ukraine while the EU aligns with U.S. tech containment policies. The piece advises the EU to reconsider its own economic interests, such as relaxing chip export controls.</p>

          <p>A French court has sentenced three individuals to prison for human trafficking, finding them guilty of exploiting undocumented migrant workers during the 2023 grape harvest in the Champagne region. The victims, primarily from West Africa, were housed in squalid, unhygienic conditions and described being treated "like slaves." The director of a servicing company received a two-year jail term, while two recruiters were each sentenced to one year. This case highlights the growing scrutiny on labor practices in the renowned wine region, with another investigation pending into the treatment of Ukrainian workers during the same harvest.</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a Member of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), has defected from the Conservative Party to join Nigel Farage's Reform UK, becoming the party's first representative in the Senedd.

The move has been met with anger from Welsh Conservatives, who said her voters would feel let down. Her defection follows a period where she faced investigations into alleged bullying and the use of a racist slur, though she expressed confidence in being cleared.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs yielding around 4.4%. The article notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently provide higher interest rates than long-term ones, a trend observed since late 2022. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to explore offerings from online banks, which typically have lower overhead, and consider short-term CDs or a laddering strategy.

This sharp increase is attributed to high tenant demand and an insufficient supply of rental properties, forcing some renters to make career decisions based on local housing costs. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, rents continue to climb in more affordable areas adjacent to urban centers.

          <p>Stephanie Wambugu's debut novel, "Lonely Crowds," examines the intense and damaging decades-long friendship between two women, Ruth and Maria. The story, told from Ruth's perspective, challenges the romantic notion of childhood bonds by revealing the secrets and misunderstandings at the core of their relationship. Growing up as the only two Black girls in their class, their dynamic becomes one of obsession and dependency, with the passive Ruth constantly seeking approval from the controlling Maria. As they navigate college and the New York art world, their childhood patterns persist, transforming their once-close bond into a liability that prevents them from truly knowing themselves or each other.</p>

          <p>The Coca-Cola Company announced it will introduce a version of its classic cola sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall. For decades, the U.S. version has used high-fructose corn syrup, while the cane sugar variant, popularly known as "Mexican Coke," has gained a loyal following. The move comes after public comments from President Donald Trump supporting the use of "REAL Cane Sugar" and aligns with a broader consumer trend, even as the company also promotes its zero-sugar options. This new product offers another choice for consumers, though research does not indicate cane sugar is a healthier alternative to corn syrup.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot was forced to take sudden evasive action to avoid a B-52 military bomber while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that he performed an "aggressive maneuver" because the bomber, which was part of a planned flyover for a local event, appeared on a converging course and was not announced by air traffic control. The Minot tower, which is privately run and lacks radar, had cleared the SkyWest flight for approach. The Air Force stated the flyover was FAA-approved, but the tower did not advise the B-52 crew of the inbound commercial flight. The FAA is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>The recent crash of a Bangladesh Air Force F-7 BGI training jet into a school in Dhaka, which killed at least 31 people, has reignited a debate about the safety of conducting military flight training over densely populated cities.

Critics and citizens are calling for military bases to be relocated from urban centers like Dhaka, one of the world's most populous cities.

          <p>UK households are facing an estimated £275 increase in their annual food bills as grocery price inflation accelerates, according to market research firm Worldpanel. Food prices rose by 5.2% over the last four weeks, the highest rate since the beginning of 2024, prompting consumers to change their shopping habits. Many are switching to cheaper supermarket own-brand products and preparing simpler meals to manage costs. The sharpest price increases were seen in items like chocolate, butter, and fresh meat, contributing to a rise in the UK's overall inflation rate to 3.6%. (not investment advice)</p>

An investigation cited in the complaint found that 90% of tested restaurants were misleading consumers, a practice the association calls "shrimp fraud."

By redesigning the train's head shape and adding an undercarriage cover to shield the bogies, they successfully reduced air resistance by over 24%.

The author contends this represents an inversion of federalism, where federal power is used not to protect rights, as historically intended, but to dismantle state-level policies that conflict with the president's agenda.

          <p>The death toll from a Bangladeshi air force jet crashing into a school in Dhaka has risen to 31, with at least 25 students among the deceased. In the aftermath, hundreds of students have taken to the streets, protesting and demanding accountability, compensation for victims, and a halt to military training flights over the densely populated city. Protesters are questioning the safety of using older aircraft for training in civilian areas. The incident has caused widespread shock and anger, with many parents still searching for their children and the death toll expected to rise further due to severe burn injuries.</p>
