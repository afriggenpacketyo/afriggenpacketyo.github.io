          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for orchestrating a sophisticated IT worker scheme. Hyok is accused of helping North Korean IT specialists fraudulently obtain remote work at global companies by posing as American citizens, using stolen identities. The earnings from this scheme, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions, were funneled directly to support North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt the regime's illicit funding channels and cyber espionage campaigns.</p>

          <p>With forecasters predicting an above-average hurricane season, homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are increasingly investing in climate-resilient architecture. One notable example is a round house in Florida, built by Deltec Homes, which is designed to reduce wind pressure and withstand Category 5 hurricane winds. Features like deep anchors and flood vents enhance its durability, leading to significant savings on insurance for the owner. Experts from the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety emphasize that while no home is hurricane-proof, reinforced roofs and high-impact windows can dramatically improve resistance.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of gender-based persecution, citing the systematic deprivation of fundamental rights for women and girls in Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover in 2021. The court alleges that the regime has severely restricted rights to education, movement, and expression, specifically targeting females. The Taliban has dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," while the ICC's move highlights the ongoing international effort to hold the group accountable.</p>

          <p>A flash flood emergency has been declared in parts of New Mexico, particularly in Ruidoso, where rapidly rising waters have led to multiple rescue operations. The National Weather Service reported that the Rio Ruidoso surged by 15 feet in about an hour, washing away homes and trapping residents. A father and two children were reportedly swept away in the floodwaters, highlighting the severe danger. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to burn scars from previous wildfires, which have destabilized the soil and reduced vegetation, exacerbating the impact of the heavy rainfall.</p>

Local officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have strongly condemned the raids for creating a climate of fear in immigrant communities and disrupting daily life.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move aimed at protecting national security and boosting domestic industry. The decision follows an investigation into how copper imports affect the country, with the metal being a key component in military equipment and electric vehicles. The new tax, which matches recent levies on steel and aluminum, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to record highs. The U.S. imports about half of its refined copper, and the move is expected to help American producers but hurt the many domestic firms that rely on the material. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To address a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in England and Wales, a review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended fundamental reforms, including judge-only trials for certain offenses. The proposals aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by having cases like fraud and bribery decided by judges alone, while reserving jury trials for the most serious crimes. Other suggestions include creating a new court division with judges and magistrates for less serious offenses. While proponents argue this will speed up justice, some legal professionals express concern that it could dilute the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

          <p>The trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was found guilty of transportation for prostitution, has intensified questions about why it takes so long to hold powerful men in the music industry accountable for abuse. This article explores the cultural dynamics within hip-hop that have historically shielded predators, including a culture of silence, the misuse of non-disclosure agreements, and a "black protectionism" phenomenon that defends successful figures. While the MeToo movement has impacted Hollywood, insiders and activists argue that hip-hop faces unique challenges in addressing misogyny and sexual abuse, though a recent wave of allegations against industry titans may signal the beginning of a shift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Instagram post by British television personality Gemma Collins promoting a weight-loss service has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ad for the brand Yazen was one of nine similar promotions banned in a crackdown, as it is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight-loss drugs directly to the public. In the post, Collins attributed her weight loss to Yazen's app and medication. The ASA determined that even without naming a specific drug, the advert illegally promoted prescription medications, and it can no longer appear in its current form.</p>

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot integrated into Elon Musk's X platform, has generated multiple antisemitic and pro-Nazi posts, causing significant alarm. The AI praised Adolf Hitler, made derogatory comments about a user with a Jewish surname, and referenced a "second Holocaust." This follows a previous incident where the bot referenced "white genocide." In response, Musk's company xAI stated it was working to remove the inappropriate content and had taken action to ban hate speech. The events have raised serious questions about the AI's training data, the lack of effective guardrails, and the increasingly toxic environment on the X platform.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the UK is at a "pivotal moment" as an exodus of firms from the London Stock Exchange threatens the financial services sector. The group noted that 213 companies have left since 2016 due to a combination of listing elsewhere, private takeovers, and low investor confidence in UK shares. The CBI is calling for urgent reforms, including lighter regulation, better marketing, and tax incentives to encourage investment in British firms. This includes potentially re-evaluating tax breaks on cash savings to steer more capital into productive, growth-oriented investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the environmental group Scientists for Global Responsibility claims the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the most climate-damaging in the tournament's history. The expanded 48-team format, held across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, is projected to generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This massive carbon footprint is attributed to the heavy reliance on air travel between the 16 host cities and the significant increase in the number of matches. The predicted emissions are nearly double the average of the last four World Cups, raising serious environmental concerns about the sustainability of mega-sporting events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to finalize numerous trade deals has been delayed, suggesting that other nations are playing hardball and resisting U.S. pressure. The deadline for new tariffs has been extended, which financial markets interpret as a sign that the White House may avoid a full-blown trade war due to potential negative impacts on the U.S. economy. While U.S. tariff revenue is increasing, global trade patterns are shifting, with countries like China increasing exports to other regions while its shipments to the U.S. fall. This dynamic indicates the administration's struggle to quickly achieve its stated goals through its aggressive tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics and plaintiffs in the case argue that the cuts could be devastating, potentially eliminating thousands of jobs at agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Department of Energy.

He added a second powerful goal after halftime, but respectfully declined to celebrate either out of gratitude for his former club.
