          <p>A small 2.7 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, causing minor tremors to be felt across the New York City metropolitan area. This was the second quake to affect the region in four days, following a slightly stronger 3.0 magnitude tremor over the weekend. Officials reported no immediate injuries or significant damage from either event, though many residents took to social media to share their experiences of the brief shaking. New York City Emergency Management confirmed they received no reports of any issues within the city resulting from the minor seismic activity.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and several former high-ranking Justice Department and FBI officials as part of its ongoing investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The committee, led by Rep. James Comer, is seeking depositions and documents to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. This action follows the DOJ's recent conclusion that Epstein did not have a "client list" and its decision not to release further information, which has prompted renewed congressional focus and bipartisan criticism.</p>

          <p>During a game between the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox, benches cleared after an exchange between Astros reliever Hector Neris and a Red Sox coach, apparently fueled by paranoia about sign-stealing. Red Sox announcer and former player Will Middlebrooks commented on the irony of the Astros being upset, referencing their major 2017 sign-stealing scandal that helped them win a World Series. The article notes that while the Red Sox also faced accusations in 2018, the incidents were considered far less severe. The Red Sox ultimately won the game 7-3.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has concluded with the capture of Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in a quadruple homicide in Tennessee. Drummond is accused of killing Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend on July 29, and then abandoning a baby in a car seat in a nearby county. He was apprehended in a wooded area in Jackson after being spotted on a home security camera. Drummond now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder, while four other individuals have been arrested for allegedly assisting him after the fact.</p>

In a letter to the new FAA administrator, she is requesting data from recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated safety tests that are now overdue, emphasizing the need for standards that reflect real-world conditions.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime rates in the United States decreased across every major category in 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murder and a significant 18.6% decrease in motor vehicle thefts. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, reflects a continuing downward trend from the spike seen immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic. While property crime rates hit their lowest point since 1961, the report also noted a slight decrease in reported hate crimes, though experts caution that many crimes still go unreported to police.</p>

However, the actual savings from unspent obligated funds are estimated to be around $165 million, less than 3% of the claimed figure.

          <p>An urgent search is underway for Alec Luhn, an award-winning American climate journalist who has gone missing during a solo backpacking trip on a glacier in Norway. Luhn, described as an experienced outdoorsman, was expected to return to the U.K. on Monday but failed to arrive for his flight. His wife reported him missing after he last shared his location from Odda in southwestern Norway on July 31. Rescue operations are currently ongoing, though they have been hampered by poor weather, and his family is appealing for any information from other hikers in the area.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released two new open-weight artificial intelligence models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, marking its first such release since 2019. These models are intended to be lower-cost alternatives that researchers and developers can run and customize, positioning them as competitors to similar offerings from companies like Meta and Mistral. While not fully open-source, their parameters are publicly available to promote transparency. After delaying the launch for additional safety testing, OpenAI confirmed the models are now available on platforms like Hugging Face and can run on a variety of hardware.</p>

          <p>In this advice column, two readers express their struggles with living to please others and feeling a loss of their own identity. One describes a lifelong pattern of being a "golden kid" that has led to an intense fear of being disliked, while the other is re-evaluating their life's purpose after leaving a high-demand religion and facing personal loss. The columnist advises them to reconnect with their own senses and internal perceptions—what they see, smell, and think—as a fundamental way to rediscover who they are, separate from the weight of external expectations.</p>

          <p>The acting administrator of NASA has directed the agency to deploy a small nuclear power plant on the moon's surface by late 2029, with the goal of preceding a similar joint effort by China and Russia. The directive warns that the first nation to establish a lunar reactor could potentially create an exclusionary zone, which would significantly inhibit the U.S. Artemis exploration program. The Fission Surface Power project will rely on microreactor technology to generate at least 100 kilowatts of electricity. This ambitious timeline comes amid proposed budget cuts for NASA and while the agency lacks a Senate-confirmed leader.</p>

          <p>Total U.S. credit card debt has climbed to $1.21 trillion, matching the all-time high from last year, according to a new quarterly report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Balances rose by $27 billion in the second quarter, while delinquency rates remain elevated, with nearly 7% of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past year. Researchers suggest this trend may be partly due to consumers overextending themselves as inflation drove up costs. The data also reveals a growing divide, with subprime borrowers showing increasing signs of financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to formally end the "five things" email program, an initiative introduced by former adviser Elon Musk that required federal employees to summarize their five main workplace achievements each week. The program, which was implemented by the Office of Personnel Management to boost accountability and aid in workforce reduction, was unpopular and inconsistently applied across government agencies. This decision signals a move away from one of Musk's most prominent initiatives following a public disagreement between him and President Trump, and it will be officially announced to federal HR representatives.</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase experienced a drop of over 5% on Tuesday after the company announced a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. This decline is part of a larger downturn that has seen the stock fall more than 30% from its record high, which was reached in mid-July. The stock had previously surged following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the first significant crypto legislation in the U.S. Despite recent legislative momentum, the slide reflects waning investor confidence and a broader risk-off sentiment in the market.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new rule that would bar U.S. veterans from receiving abortions at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, including in cases of sexual assault, incest, or when the pregnancy endangers their life. This move would revoke a 2022 policy expansion under the Biden administration that ensured abortion access for vets, particularly in states with restrictive laws. A VA spokesperson stated the change would bring the department "back in line with historical norms," while opponents predict it will deter veterans from seeking care at VA facilities.

The couple, who were on a round-the-world trip when detained, are reportedly being held in separate prisons. Their family continues to urge the British government to officially recognize them as hostages and intensify efforts to secure their release.</p>
