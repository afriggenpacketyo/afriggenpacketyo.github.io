          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of landslides, the most common geological event, outlining the four main types: falls, topples, slides, and flows. It explores the primary causes, such as excessive rainfall, earthquakes, and human industrial activity, which increase pressure on slopes. The text also highlights that these events are not confined to developing nations, citing recent occurrences in the United States. Prevention is possible through improved drainage, reinforced slopes, and avoiding construction in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic landslide has reportedly killed over 1,000 people in the village of Tarasin, located in Sudan's war-torn Darfur region. The Sudan Liberation Movement, which controls the area, stated that heavy rains caused the disaster, leaving only one known survivor. This tragedy is compounded by the ongoing civil war, which has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis and severely restricts access for aid organizations. The surrounding region is also experiencing intense fighting and starvation, particularly in the besieged city of El-Fasher.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cadillac is experiencing a significant brand revival, largely driven by surging sales of its electric vehicles, which are helping it regain ground against foreign luxury competitors. While the gasoline-powered Escalade remains its top seller, EVs now account for roughly a third of recent sales, far outpacing the industry average. Notably, nearly 80% of Cadillac's new EV customers are trading in vehicles from rival brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, indicating a successful shift in consumer perception and market share.</p>

          <p>In an effort to win back customers impacted by inflation, McDonald's is expanding its value offerings by reintroducing its Extra Value Meals. These combo meals, last promoted before the pandemic, will offer customers a 15% savings compared to purchasing items separately. This strategic move is a direct response to shrinking traffic at fast-food chains, particularly from low-income consumers who have reduced their spending. The company plans to introduce additional deals later in the year to maintain momentum.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing costs have surged to their highest level since 1998, placing significant pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget. The rising interest rates on government bonds reflect growing investor concern about the state of the nation's public finances and the government's ability to adhere to its fiscal rules. This economic pressure, combined with a weakening pound, has fueled speculation that the chancellor may be forced to implement tax increases to stabilize the financial situation.

          <p>A year after mpox was declared a public health emergency, the virus has expanded its reach across Africa, with suspected cases exceeding 100,000 this year. Experts are criticizing the global response as dangerously slow, particularly concerning the distribution of vaccines. Pledges from countries like the U.S. have largely failed to materialize, with millions of promised doses not being delivered. Although recent data shows a decline in cases in some hotspots, specialists worry that the inadequate response is allowing the virus to become permanently entrenched.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have charged three dockworkers in Sydney following the seizure of 1,116 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $107 million. The drugs were discovered hidden behind a fake wall inside a shipping container that had arrived from Europe. The arrests are part of an ongoing operation by a multi-agency task force that specifically targets "trusted insiders" within supply chains who use their positions to facilitate large-scale drug importations for organized crime syndicates.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece written by parents of students suspended from Columbia University criticizes the institution's handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests. They argue that the university, which often promotes its history of student activism, has hypocritically punished over 100 students for protesting the genocide in Gaza. The authors claim this constitutes a "Palestine exception to free speech," suggesting the administration is prioritizing the demands of donors and politicians over the principles of free assembly and the wellbeing of its students.</p>

          <p>This political analysis argues that President Donald Trump has developed a pattern of inventing or exaggerating crises to invoke emergency powers, thereby expanding his executive authority. The article cites his declaration of a "crime emergency" to federalize D.C. police and claiming an "invasion" to deploy the military for immigration enforcement as key examples. The author expresses concern that a lack of meaningful resistance from Congress and the courts is eroding the traditional checks and balances designed to restrain such presidential overreach.</p>

          <p>Biologists are increasingly focusing on "dark taxa," a term for the vast number of species on Earth that remain undiscovered and undescribed, potentially accounting for 90% of all life. These organisms are typically small, such as insects, mites, and fungi, but play critical roles in maintaining healthy ecosystems. With advancements in DNA sequencing technology, scientists are now able to identify hundreds of new species in single locations, revealing that our planet's biodiversity is far more extensive and mysterious than previously understood.</p>

According to the British Beer and Pub Association, a combination of factors, including increased minimum wage, higher business rates, and reduced consumer spending, is creating unsustainable financial pressure. Industry leaders are urgently calling on the government to provide relief through measures like cutting business rates and VAT in the next budget to prevent thousands of closures and subsequent job losses.</p>
