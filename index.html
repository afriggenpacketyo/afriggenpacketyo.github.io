          <p>Two men have been sentenced to jail for stealing a £4.8 million gold toilet from an art exhibition at Blenheim Palace in September 2019. James 'Jimmy' Sheen pleaded guilty to burglary and related charges, while Michael Jones was found guilty of burglary; they received sentences of four years and two years and three months, respectively. Sheen's DNA was found at the scene, along with incriminating messages on his phone detailing the sale of the stolen gold. The messages used coded language, including Romany slang and cockney rhyming slang, to discuss the valuable toilet, which Sheen confirmed he possessed, and he referred to the gold as "car," and the messages indicated that the car (gold) is as good as money. The audacious heist involved smashing into the palace and ripping out the functional, 18-carat solid gold toilet. The article highlights the investigative work required to decipher the criminals' code and bring them to justice.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongly deported and then returned to the U.S., has pleaded not guilty to human trafficking charges in Tennessee. He faces charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens, with prosecutors alleging he participated in a conspiracy to traffic migrants into the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. Abrego Garcia's lawyers claim the Trump administration abused its power, accusing them of delay and secrecy in returning him to the U.S., and deny allegations that he is a member of MS-13, the attorneys believe that a jury will not find him guilty based on the evidence. Protesters gathered outside the courthouse, calling for an end to immigration raids and due process, while Abrego Garcia's legal team has moved to keep the civil case seeking his return active. The case highlights the legal and political complexities surrounding immigration enforcement and the rights of undocumented migrants.</p>

          <p>The IPO market is showing signs of a strong rebound in June 2025, with successful public debuts from companies like Chime, Voyager Technologies, and Circle. This resurgence is encouraging more companies to consider going public, leading to potential upside for investment banking divisions within firms like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. While geopolitical tensions, such as Israel's attack on Iran, and unpredictable trade policies could cause volatility, the IPO market is on track to outpace May's activity. A better second half of 2025 would be welcome news for banks that rely heavily on dealmaking revenues, the growing capital markets business at Wells Fargo may also benefit. The article suggests that while risks remain, the IPO market is gaining momentum after a rocky start to the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Israel launched strikes against Iran early Friday morning local time, targeting the country's nuclear program and killing nuclear scientists and military leaders, according to Israeli officials. Iran responded with an aerial attack involving approximately 100 drones, but Israel claims all were shot down before reaching their targets. The U.S. had advance notice of the strikes but did not provide assistance or have any involvement. The strikes have heightened tensions in the Middle East, raising concerns about further escalation and regional stability.</p>

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, a federal agent testified about guns and drugs recovered at his home. "Jane," testifying under a pseudonym, completed her testimony, with prosecutors seeking to reframe the interpretation of her suggestive text messages to Combs. During redirect questioning, "Jane" stated she did not derive physical pleasure from sex with entertainers and was merely "putting on a show," and she described Combs' demeanor during one encounter as "evil." The defense pointed out texts between "Jane" and Combs about tender moments, suggesting she could have reported the violence, but she testified that the violence occurred while she knew Combs was under federal investigation. "Jane" also retorted to the defense that 150,000 dollars was not her worth during her time with Combs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has lost his latest effort to secure a retrial in the E. Jean Carroll case, where a jury found him liable for sexual assault and defamation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied his request for an en banc review, leaving the Supreme Court as his last option to overturn the jury's verdict. Carroll and her attorney praised the decision, emphasizing that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. The appeals court rejected Trump's complaints about the judge's decisions during the trial, reaffirming the original ruling and the $5 million in damages awarded to Carroll for the sexual assault.

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily returned control of California’s National Guard to Donald Trump hours after a judge ruled the president’s use of the guard to suppress protests in Los Angeles was illegal. The decision by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit paused a temporary restraining order against Trump issued by US district judge Charles Breyer until at least an emergency hearing scheduled for 17 June. Breyer ruled that Trump’s move to federalize the California national guard was illegal and ordered the guard to be returned to California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, paving the way for a legal battle destined to reach the US supreme court. The stay meant Trump earned a reprieve on a testing day that also saw a sitting US senator, Alex Padilla, manhandled to the ground by federal agents after interrupting a news conference held by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.</p>

The apology came after Gaines lashed out at Biles for her comments, leading to a clash between the two. Despite the apology, the backlash from the American right continued, with some criticizing Biles' mental health advocacy and calling her "mentally weak," but Biles stood by her broader point that sports organizations have a responsibility to create inclusive rules while maintaining fair competition.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has withdrawn the U.S. federal government from an agreement to recover the salmon population in the Pacific Northwest, labeling the plan as “radical environmentalism.” The decision removes the U.S. from a deal brokered by Joe Biden with Washington, Oregon, and Native American tribes to restore salmon populations and develop clean energy for tribes. The agreement, known as the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, involved the federal government spending over $1 billion over a decade to help recover salmon runs. Tribes and conservationists have condemned the decision, stating that it breaks promises and prioritizes energy infrastructure over environmental concerns, while north-western Republicans in Congress had largely opposed the agreement, warning that it would hurt the region’s economy.</p>

Archer said the funding round gives the company a pro forma liquidity position of roughly $2 billion, and the stock offering follows President Trump's executive order creating a pilot program to support eVTOL vehicle development.

The defense argued that a sloppy investigation, lack of physical evidence, and witness testimony leave reasonable doubt, calling the prosecution's crash reconstruction a "ridiculous blue paint kindergarten project." The lead homicide detective was fired from the Massachusetts State Police and did not testify at trial, and the case is expected to go to jurors after more than 30 days of testimony.

          <p>Disagreements between Kamala Harris's campaign and the Future Forward super PAC on strategy contributed to her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 election. The Harris campaign favored attacking Trump's character, while Future Forward focused on the economy and presenting Harris as a disruptor. This lack of coordination resulted in conflicting messaging and inefficient resource allocation, and after the election, anger has continued to fester as Future Forward positions itself to play a major role in the 2028 presidential election. The conflict revealed a fundamental flaw in the Democratic Party's structure for defeating Trump, raising questions about control and future direction, as some question whether Future Forward should determine strategy for presidential candidates.</p>

          <p>Sen.

This expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders," to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits, and Hawley calls the inclusion a "huge step forward" in securing compensation for affected individuals.

          <p>A documentary, The Settlers, examines Israeli settlers in the West Bank, revealing their open pursuit of territorial expansion, even if it violates international law. Daniella Weiss, a prominent figure in the settler movement, expresses her desire to expand settlements into the Gaza Strip, capitalizing on the displacement caused by the war on Hamas. The documentary highlights the views of religious extremists who believe their claim to the land comes from a higher authority, and the film also features Americans who have moved to the region to pursue what they see as a more meaningful life. Despite criticisms of unfairly focusing on a fringe minority, the documentary reveals the views of those who believe they have an uncompromisable right to disputed land, backed by God’s will and military might.</p>

The headline index of consumer sentiment was at 60.5, exceeding expectations, and the one-year inflation outlook tumbled from levels not seen since 1981. Consumers appear to have adjusted to the shock of high tariffs announced in April, although concerns about the impact of tariffs on prices and geopolitical issues persist. The Michigan survey had been an outlier on inflation fears, with other indicators showing a more contained outlook, and economists still largely expect the tariffs to show impact in the coming months (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Israel's strikes on Iran caused a surge in global financial markets on Friday, with the price of oil rising significantly, prompting worries about higher energy prices. Brent Crude rose more than 10% before falling back to around $75 a barrel, and more expensive energy can lead to higher prices for almost everything, from farming to manufacturing. The main questions are how long Israel and Iran remain locked in this conflict, whether other countries in the region are drawn in, and whether the US steps in to de-escalate the situation. Above all it depends on whether we see actual disruption to shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway off Iran's southern coast, which is the route to global markets for about a fifth of the world's oil production.</p>
