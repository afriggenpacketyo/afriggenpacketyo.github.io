          <p>Sunday's newspapers are dominated by defense-related stories ahead of Monday's strategic defense review, with the Sunday Telegraph reporting that the UK is to "be made 'war-ready' with ¬£1.5bn for bomb factories" and will commit to buying 7,000 long-range weapons. The Sunday Times reports that British fighter jets will carry nuclear bombs, marking the "biggest defence expansion since the Cold War." The Mail on Sunday claims the government's pledge to tackle illegal immigration was left "in tatters" as French police officers "stood idly by" while people scrambled to board dinghies. The newspapers also cover domestic issues, such as potential junior doctor strikes and the rising cost of faulty PPE bought during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman as its nominee for NASA administrator, a move that surprised many in the space industry. President Trump announced the decision online, stating he would soon announce a new nominee who will put America first in space. Isaacman, a billionaire private astronaut with close ties to Elon Musk, expressed gratitude for the support he received during the nomination process. The decision comes days after Musk's departure from the White House, and it is unclear who will replace Isaacman, although Lt Gen Steven Kwast is being considered. Some scientists see the change as destabilizing to NASA, especially given proposed budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler has been found guilty in her third trial for the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness. The case, which has spanned over two decades, involved a complex investigation with no direct evidence linking Chandler to the crime scene. Chandler's daughter, Hailey Seel, testified against her mother, detailing a history of stalking and obsession. The first conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, and the second trial ended in a hung jury, but this time Chandler represented herself. Chandler is scheduled to be sentenced on June 3, 2025, while her supporter Darryl Burton believes she is innocent.</p>

          <p>Pete Hegseth has called on Asian countries to increase their military spending to deter China, stating that Beijing is ‚Äúrehearsing for the real deal‚Äù of taking over Taiwan. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, the US defense secretary reiterated pledges to increase the US presence in the Indo-Pacific and outlined new joint projects. Hegseth urged Asian nations to follow Europe's example in boosting their defensive spending, emphasizing that deterrence does not come cheap and that time is of the essence.

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident occurred at about 4 a.m., leading to the closure of Weidkamp Road. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area, and more than two dozen beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort to re-hive the bees and find their queen. Officials stated that the road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the bee recovery, and hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered and restored.</p>

Productions are increasingly moving to other states and countries offering more generous tax incentives. California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to more than double the state's annual film and TV tax credits, but some believe it may be too little, too late to offset the high cost of working in the state.</p>

While funding increased sharply in 2024, the IFS predicts that it will no longer increase year on year, given the government's commitments.
