          <p>Tesla reported a significant drop in first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue falling 20% due to factory updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices. Net income also plummeted, and the company cited evolving trade policies and political sentiment as impacting demand. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's administration, specifically with government downsizing efforts, has raised investor concerns about his focus on Tesla. Tesla shares have suffered, and the company refrained from promising growth this year, noting increasing uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has temporarily blocked the deportation of migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, calling the practice 'medieval' and raising concerns about due process. The Trump administration invoked the act to deport alleged gang members, some without criminal records, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The judge criticized the use of tattoos as a factor in identifying gang members and emphasized the right to defend oneself against deportation. Another judge in Colorado issued a similar order, requiring adequate notice and information in a language the individual understands before deportation.</p>

          <h2>Economists Doubt Trump's Claim That Tariff Revenue Could Replace Income Tax</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 16:46:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. However, economists are skeptical about the feasibility of this proposal, with one economist from the Tax Foundation calling it 'not a realistic proposal'. Tariff negotiations are ongoing, with a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs enacted earlier in April, but the idea of completely replacing income tax with tariff revenue is viewed as highly improbable given the scale of federal income tax collection.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seems inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their children out of instruction involving storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom by requiring participation in such instruction. Several justices expressed skepticism about the school board's decision to eliminate opt-outs, with some questioning why it was not feasible to accommodate religious objections, particularly given the availability of opt-outs for other sensitive topics.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded strongly on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1,000 points, after a sharp sell-off triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Investors had initially rushed to sell shares due to uncertainty about trade policy and potential changes at the Fed. However, positive factors such as the possibility of a US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Republicans helped to restore confidence. Despite the rebound, the International Monetary Fund lowered its U.S. growth forecast due to escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order halting the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that individuals were in imminent danger of being deported to a prison in El Salvador, highlighting concerns about due process. The judge's order requires 21 days' notice, information about the right to judicial review, and access to legal counsel for those subject to deportation under the Act. This follows the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport non-citizens deemed 'dangerous'.</p>

The reorganization includes changes to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, which Rubio claims had become a platform for left-wing activism. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen cautioned that reforms must be done with care, warning against America retreating and creating a void for China and Russia.

          <p>A jury determined that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial that she claimed damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to an atmosphere of violence before a 2011 mass shooting. The Times issued a correction less than 14 hours after publication, and its former editorial page editor apologized for the error. The jury concluded that the error was not published with 'actual malice,' a necessary condition for libel claims involving public figures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers is raising concerns about its potential impact on the economy.

The resumption of collections ends a pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and millions of borrowers will soon need to begin repayment.</p>

          <p>Despite recent challenges, Tesla maintains the highest per-unit profit margin in the automotive industry and is still growing earnings at an 18-20% annual rate, according to Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management. He suggests that Tesla can leverage its Full Self Driving (FSD) offering and energy unit to offset contractions in its auto business. Mulberry believes that the current valuation of Tesla stock makes it a worthwhile investment. Tesla's power unit has grown substantially over the past three years, and licensing FSD to other automakers could provide further revenue streams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After suing CBS for billions over a "60 Minutes" story, and railing against recent coverage that the thin-skinned Commander in Chief viewed as negative towards him, Trump achieved his knockout blow with the news that award-winning "60 Minutes" executive producer Bill Owens would resign after nearly 40 years on the program. In an emotionally charged meeting Tuesday afternoon, and again in a note to staff released publicly shortly after, the show's executive producer, Bill Owens said he was departing after 37 years with CBS News following months of heavy-handed treatment of the show by corporate leaders. It’s worth recalling Trump’s initial lawsuit was predicated on the flimsy premise that the newsmagazine had edited a pre-election interview with his rival, Kamala Harris, in order to make her look better, never mind that such editing is viewed as standard TV-news practice, and that Trump had been offered a similar forum he declined to accept.</p>

A 25-year-old TikTok creator from Toronto who also runs an herbal-honey company, sometimes gets 1 million likes on a video in which he flips through huge dossiers the entire time he is talking.
