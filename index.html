          <h2>HBO Max to Rebrand Back to Original Name After Brief Stint as Max</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is reversing its decision to rename HBO Max to simply Max, opting to bring back the original HBO Max branding this summer. The company aims to refocus on high-quality programming rather than a broad range of content. CEO David Zaslav emphasized that HBO represents the highest quality in media, while JB Perrette highlighted the platform's distinct programming for adults and families. This move mirrors Disney's strategy of prioritizing quality content over quantity in the streaming market, as legacy media companies continue to navigate profitability challenges and increased competition from services like Netflix.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy stated his goal is to improve American health and agency morale by cutting costs and focusing on chronic disease, mental health, and food safety. Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro criticized the cuts, arguing they would harm critical services and lead to deaths. Kennedy also addressed criticism of the agency's response to the measles outbreak and faced questions about his stance on vaccines, leading to heated exchanges with committee members.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student detained by ICE. Arias Cristobal, who lacks authorization to be in the U.S., was initially pulled over for an improper turn, but officials later determined the officer stopped the wrong vehicle. Despite the dismissal, DHS maintains that Arias Cristobal and her father, who was also detained, are in the country illegally and must face the consequences, even though they lack criminal records. The family fears deportation, and the case has sparked community outrage, highlighting the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies.</p>

The court found the commission's explanation insufficient, emphasizing the importance of transparency in matters of public interest.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and market volatility, experts suggest strategic approaches to gold investing, such as considering gold's price in context of its historical performance and understanding the different types of gold investments available. Wealth manager Joshua Barone notes that gold's recent performance is exceptional but supported by strong fundamentals like central bank purchases. Paul Williams recommends physical gold for long-term wealth storage, while John Berman suggests gold ETFs for liquidity. Experts also advise investors to be tax-aware, as physical gold is taxed at a higher rate. (not investment advice)</p>

Farmers are already irrigating crops earlier than usual, and the Angling Trust emphasizes the next few weeks are crucial in determining if a drought will be declared.

Family offices also compete with banks and private equity firms for talent, and they often prioritize trust over other criteria.

          <p>As cease-fire negotiations approach, Russia is asserting its dominance in Ukraine, demanding territorial concessions and military limitations. President Putin claims Russian forces are gaining ground, while the Trump administration views Russia's demands as unrealistic given the costly and incremental nature of their advances. The situation poses a challenge for Washington, which seeks to convince Putin that improved relations with the U.S. outweigh the benefits of continued conflict. The article highlights the high cost of Russia's territorial gains and the potential for a prolonged war of attrition.</p>

If confirmed, his death would deprive the group of another top commander, but it might not lead to a strategic shift. While the death of Sinwar, who is considered one of the biggest obstacles to a new cease-fire in Gaza, would undermine the group, analysts said, it might not change Hamasâ€™s strategic outlook and operational abilities, or soften Israelâ€™s uncompromising approach to cease-fire negotiations. For decades, Hamas has weathered the assassinations of scores of its top leaders, repeatedly proving that its survival does not depend on any single individual.</p>

The defendant, Peter Coker Jr., was set upon by as many as 10 fellow inmates in the Thai lockup, his lawyer said. Coker Jr., 56, was being held there after police found him in Thailand while under indictment in the United States for the scheme that artificially inflated the stock price of the deli owner, Hometown International , and a related shell company, E-Waste.

          <p>Andor, the Disney+ Star Wars spin-off series that concluded this week, traveled far, far away from the generally wholesome and fantastical adventures of the Jedi. The gritty story of Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna), a disillusioned smuggler turned Rebel Alliance operative, trained its attention on ordinary people trying to survive an oppressive system. Andor was the TV prequel to the film Rogue One, which was itself a prequel to the first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy; like its predecessor, Andor took its Star Wars storytelling seriously. The show held on to the franchiseâ€™s core idea that there exists in the universe a constant tension between good and evil. But it boldly interrogated the origins of that dichotomy, focusing on what pushes someone to adopt one set of beliefs over another.</p>
