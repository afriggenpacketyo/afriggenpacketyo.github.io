          <p>Iran held a large public funeral in Tehran for senior military commanders and nuclear scientists who were killed during a recent 12-day conflict with Israel. Among the deceased were high-ranking members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its chief, General Hossein Salami. The event saw large crowds and anti-Western chants, though Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was notably absent. Following the conflict, reports indicate the Iranian regime has intensified an internal security crackdown, arresting hundreds accused of espionage for Israel.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled an updated version of their comprehensive spending and tax cut bill, which incorporates much of President Trump's domestic agenda. The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts and boosts funding for border security and defense, but key differences from the House version have emerged, particularly a larger increase to the debt ceiling and significant changes to Medicaid. The bill faces internal party divisions, especially from fiscal conservatives concerned about the deficit and moderates opposed to deep cuts in social safety net programs, setting the stage for a difficult series of votes.

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, Republican leaders are using his self-described democratic socialist platform as a national line of attack. They aim to portray the entire Democratic party as radical and out of touch, a strategy highlighted at the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit. While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, moderates and party leaders have been more hesitant, creating a complex dynamic. The strategy has also led to some Republicans launching what critics call Islamophobic attacks against Mamdani, who is a Muslim of Indian descent.</p>

          <p>A Colorado funeral home owner, Jon Hallford, has been sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in federal prison for defrauding families and the government. Hallford pleaded guilty to charges after authorities discovered nearly 190 decaying bodies improperly stored in a decrepit building and that he had provided fake ashes to grieving families. He also fraudulently obtained almost $900,000 in COVID-19 relief funds, which he spent on luxury items. During the sentencing, victims, including a young boy, described the profound emotional trauma caused by the desecration of their loved ones' remains.</p>

          <p>As a record heat wave affects the U.S., child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the dangers of leaving children in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died from heatstroke in cars, with an average of 38 such deaths occurring annually. Experts emphasize that a vehicle's internal temperature can rise by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature increases three to five times faster than an adult's. Safety organizations are promoting the "ACT" acronymâ€”Avoid, Create reminders, and Take actionâ€”to prevent these tragedies, which they stress can happen to any distracted caregiver.</p>

          <p>The New York Islanders selected 17-year-old defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the first overall pick in the NHL draft during a poignant ceremony. Schaefer, an exceptional puck-moving blueliner from the Erie Otters, endured the death of his mother from cancer just 16 months ago. In an emotional moment, he kissed a pink ribbon patch the Islanders had added to his jersey in her honor. The selection marks a significant moment for both the player, who is lauded for his on-ice talent and personal resilience, and the franchise, which used its first No. 1 pick since 2009.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a decisive 54-7 win against the Western Force in Perth, scoring eight tries in front of a record crowd. Despite a competitive first half where the Force controlled possession, the Lions' clinical finishing gave them a 21-7 lead at halftime. The tourists dominated the second half, though the victory was marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries. The comprehensive win provides a strong start, but Williams' potential absence is a significant concern for the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled against the use of nationwide injunctions, a significant shift in the power of federal courts. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that these broad injunctions, which halt government policy for everyone, are a recent invention with no historical basis. While this ends a tool frequently used to block presidential administrations, the ruling leaves other avenues for broad relief open, such as class-action lawsuits and the principle of providing "complete relief" to plaintiffs. This decision's implications will affect legal challenges across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary was significantly fueled by the grassroots Palestinian liberation movement. The author contends that Mamdani's unapologetic support for Palestine, once a political liability, has become a central issue in domestic politics due to widespread activism and shifting public opinion. The campaign's success is credited not just to a progressive platform, but to the organized efforts of activists and groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. It suggests the win is a referendum on the Democratic establishment's pro-Israel stance.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ advocates argue that the Trump administration is employing a "divide and conquer" strategy by primarily targeting transgender people with restrictive policies. This approach, they say, aims to create division within the broader LGBTQ+ community, suggesting other groups might be spared if they sacrifice the trans community. Since taking office, the administration has issued executive orders mirroring the conservative Project 2025 agenda, such as restricting gender markers on passports and banning certain books. While these orders face legal challenges, critics contend they have already had a chilling effect and fostered a climate of fear.</p>

These minerals are essential for both gasoline-powered cars and electric vehicles. China controls about 90% of the world's rare earth processing and holds a complete monopoly on heavy rare earths. This dependency allows Beijing to disrupt global supply chains at will, forcing automakers to confront the urgent need for alternative sourcing, recycling, and innovation to reduce their reliance on China.

The author posits that the American-led era of free trade and open markets, or neoliberalism, is ending, driven by populist and nationalist movements. This is not just a software update of new ideas but a hardware change in markets and institutions. The piece contends that the current political climate is forcing a change in the economy's core purpose, but the new governing ideology that will replace neoliberalism is still fiercely contested.

Many returnees, some of whom have lived abroad for decades, arrive at the border with nothing and have no homes to return to.

The legislation proposes stricter work requirements for parents of school-aged children and older adults, putting millions at risk of losing their benefits.

This dramatic policy shift, which will involve nearly $400 billion in defense spending through 2029, is seen as a response to demands from NATO partners and a new sense of urgency regarding European security.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Butte County, California, have charged 11 suspects in connection with a bizarre series of burglaries at a rural home. The 64-year-old homeowner was forced to flee her property after it was repeatedly ransacked, creating a dire situation for her. The extensive damage caused by the human intruders was so severe that it allowed a group of bears to enter and take up residence in the home, causing even more destruction. Prosecutors have arrested most of the suspects, who are accused of first-degree residential burglary.</p>
