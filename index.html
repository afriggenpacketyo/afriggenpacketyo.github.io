            <p>The U.S. Navy has deployed the USS Stockdale, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, to the southern border to support U.S. Northern Command operations. This deployment is in line with President Trump's executive orders focused on securing the border and addressing illegal immigration and drug smuggling. The warship, recently returning from a deployment where it successfully repelled Houthi attacks, will work with a U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment to enhance border security. This action reinforces the Navy's role in supporting the Department of Defense's efforts to address critical capability gaps along the southern border, joining other destroyers already stationed there.

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, can proceed. The decision came despite a request from District Attorney Nathan Hochman to withdraw a previous motion that favored reducing their sentences. Hochman argued that the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes, while the defense contends they have shown rehabilitation. The brothers hope to secure freedom through resentencing or clemency, with a state parole board also conducting a risk assessment. The resentencing hearing is scheduled to continue, potentially leading to parole eligibility.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed Hospital, his first comprehensive checkup of his second term. While the full results were not immediately released, Trump mentioned taking a cognitive test and said he "got every answer right." Presidential physicals are often seen as curated PR events intended to reassure the public of the president's fitness to serve. Details from Trump's last known comprehensive exam in 2023 were limited, but his physician stated his overall health was excellent and cognitive exams were exceptional. The White House press secretary indicated that a report from the president's physician would be released soon in an effort of transparency.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation. This decision reverses the Biden administration's earlier extensions of TPS, which were based on the dangerous conditions in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Afghanistan no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS designation. Critics argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened, and the decision undermines America's promise to protect allies who worked with the U.S. government during the war. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader overhaul of immigration policy.</p>

            <p>Experts are warning that a prolonged trade war between the U.S. and China could have devastating consequences for African economies. While U.S.-Africa trade remains small, several African nations rely on exports to the U.S. and could be hit hard by tariffs. Resource-rich countries like South Africa and those with clothing manufacturing industries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) are particularly vulnerable. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on goods from several African countries, exacerbating the potential economic fallout if China's economy falters due to the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system, which impacted the code used to exempt freight from new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, has been resolved after lasting for more than 10 hours. The glitch affected entries filed since April 9 and caused confusion among U.S. shippers regarding tariff exemptions for goods already in transit. Customs advised filers to resubmit applicable entry summaries. The incident raised concerns about Customs' ability to handle the new tariff policy and collect revenue effectively, adding to the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding trade policy.</p>

The Justice Department argued that it needed more time to review the Supreme Court's order and that foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines.

Burgum compared the list to "Hotel California," stating that species never leave, and wants to celebrate the removal of animals from the list with genetic engineering technology. He added that "the only thing we’d like to see go extinct is the need for an endangered species list to exist."</p>
