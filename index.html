        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has determined that Iran has not met its nuclear non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such instance in two decades. This finding has led to a resolution passed by the IAEA's board of governors, which carries the potential for referral to the UN Security Council. The IAEA's report cited a lack of cooperation from Iran, raising concerns about undeclared nuclear material and secret activities in areas under investigation. Iran had warned European powers against backing the motion, stating that it would respond strongly to such actions.</p>

China's Foreign Ministry countered that its military activities are compliant with international law and accused Japanese reconnaissance activities of causing maritime and air security risks.
