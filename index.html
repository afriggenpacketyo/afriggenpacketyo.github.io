          <p>In a New York Times interview, former President Joe Biden defended his administration's use of an autopen to sign documents for a mass clemency action that affected over 1,500 individuals. He asserted that he personally "made every decision" regarding the criteria for the pardons, even if he did not sign each name individually. This practice has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans, including President Trump, who have suggested it was used to conceal a potential cognitive decline and have called for an investigation.</p>

          <p>London's Southend Airport was closed until further notice after a plane crashed, which witnesses described as a "huge fireball." The incident involved a flight operated by the Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, which confirmed its aircraft was in an accident. Emergency services responded to the scene, and while the number of casualties has not been officially confirmed, the airport has cancelled all flights and advised passengers to contact their airlines for information while an investigation is underway.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain was characterized by a level of spectacle typically associated with an American Super Bowl rather than a traditional soccer match. Held in New Jersey, the event featured a military flyover, a celebrity red carpet, and high-profile musical performances from artists like Coldplay and Robbie Williams. This lavish production, which also included President Trump's attendance, signals FIFA's intent to position the tournament as a major global entertainment event.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended its decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil, a nation with which the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett framed the move as part of a broader global strategy aimed at onshoring production to mitigate national security risks. This defense illustrates the administration's unconventional approach to trade, utilizing tariffs as a flexible tool in various economic and diplomatic contexts, even when traditional justifications like trade deficits do not apply.
