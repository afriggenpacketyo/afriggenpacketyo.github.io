          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial test vote on a comprehensive tax and spending package strongly supported by the White House. The bill, which includes significant tax cuts alongside funding for immigration and defense, faces an uncertain future due to internal Republican disputes and procedural hurdles. Key disagreements remain over Medicaid spending cuts and state tax deductions, though some GOP senators who previously expressed opposition have indicated they will now vote to advance the legislation. The White House has framed the vote as a critical test of party loyalty and promise-keeping.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a "Love is Love" concert organized by five Democratic senators at the Kennedy Center, arguing it was a performative and inauthentic stunt. The author contends that labeling the event "guerrilla theater" is absurd, as it was a sanctioned event hosted by powerful officials in a prestigious venue. The piece suggests such actions are out of touch with everyday Americans and serve as a distraction from substantive policy debates. It frames the protest as a reaction by the political left to a perceived loss of cultural influence.</p>

          <p>Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international hundred, leading her team to a commanding 97-run victory over England. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. England's response faltered early, and despite a solid 66 from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, they were bowled out for 113. The result marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and highlights areas for improvement as they continue the five-match series.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, openly defying a government ban enacted under a controversial law targeting LGBTQ+ events. The march, framed by organizers and the city's mayor as a municipal event to bypass the ban, proceeded despite threats of fines and potential police action. Many participants viewed the event not only as a stand for LGBTQ+ rights but also as a protest against what they see as broader democratic erosion under Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. The significant turnout is seen as a public rebuke to the government's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has strongly criticized the expanded 32-team Club World Cup, calling it "the worst idea ever implemented in football." He voiced serious fears about the increased workload and lack of adequate recovery time for players, warning it could lead to unprecedented injuries. Klopp's comments echo concerns from the global players' union, Fifpro, which has also highlighted the congested fixture calendar. He argued that the relentless schedule devalues the sport by preventing players from delivering top performances consistently.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially confirmed it will cease funding Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, marking a significant shift in American foreign policy driven by an anti-vaccine stance. In a speech to a Gavi summit, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the organization of ignoring vaccine safety and stifling dissent, formalizing a move first reported in March. Gavi, which has vaccinated over a billion children and saved an estimated 19 million lives, warns that the loss of its third-largest donor could lead to over a million preventable child deaths.

The controversy has led to calls for an official inquiry commission to review the government's overall pandemic response, including lockdowns and the role of scientific advice.

This move represents a new front in authors' fight against AI, shifting focus from lawsuits against tech companies to direct appeals to their publishing partners.

This analysis suggests the low-cost, high-impact strategy provides a blueprint for smaller nations to counter the airpower of larger adversaries.
