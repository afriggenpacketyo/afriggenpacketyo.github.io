          <p>The Red Cross reported that at least 21 people were killed and dozens wounded in an incident near an aid distribution center in Rafah, Gaza. The organization stated that its field hospital received a large influx of patients, many with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, and that all patients said they were trying to reach the aid site. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed an initial inquiry showed its forces did not fire at people near the center, while Hamas blamed "Israeli gunfire." MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) described the aid delivery system as dehumanizing and ineffective, as the situation on the ground remains unclear. The BBC could not immediately verify the footage.</p>

          <p>Multiple people were injured in an attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, where a pro-Israel demonstration was taking place. Police have taken a suspect into custody and are investigating the incident, which left victims with injuries consistent with burns. The FBI is investigating the attack as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, while local police are refraining from labeling it as terror at this stage. The attack occurred on the eve of the Jewish holiday, Shavuot, and has prompted cancellation of upcoming Run for Their Lives events, an organization that hosts global run and walk events, "calling for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas," according to its website.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of over 25,000 residents across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, with Manitoba declaring a state of emergency. The ongoing hot, dry weather is exacerbating the fires, stretching resources thin and causing smoke to worsen air quality in Canada and parts of the U.S. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reports more than 170 active fires, with 89 considered "out of control." The U.S. is sending firefighters and equipment to assist, as the situation remains critical with potential for further evacuations. Evacuation centers have opened across the province for those fleeing the fires.</p>

          <p>Pharmacists in the UK are warning of a critical shortage of Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy essential for patients with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. The shortage is causing patients to ration medication and skip meals, leading to weight loss and reduced ability to cope with treatments like chemotherapy. The Department of Health and Social Care attributes the shortage to European-wide supply issues caused by manufacturing constraints and has extended a serious shortage protocol. Charities and clinicians are urging the government to intervene and develop a national strategy to address the shortage, as patients face increased stress and risk to their health.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack, "Operation Spider's Web," deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, an operation allegedly supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The drones hit airfields as far as Russia's Irkutsk region, over 2,500 miles from Ukraine, in what local authorities confirmed was the first such incident in the region. This comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at a training site and as both sides prepare for another round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia, with casualties reported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has a disproportionately high number of successful actors in Hollywood, including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett. This phenomenon is attributed to factors like excellent training grounds, such as the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and a strong work ethic among Australian actors. NIDA emphasizes devising original work and instills a "can do, will tell" attitude, encouraging actors to create their own opportunities. The country's remoteness also allows actors to develop their skills away from the immediate pressures of Hollywood, fostering a unique blend of skill, confidence, and humility.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity experts are concerned about the increasing collaboration between young, English-speaking Western hackers and established Russian ransomware gangs. Groups like Scattered Spider, known for their social engineering skills, partner with Russian gangs like BlackCat, who provide malware and experience in negotiating ransoms. This alliance has led to more sophisticated and damaging attacks, including those on MGM Resorts and Colonial Pipeline. The Russian government's provision of a safe haven for these gangs, as long as they don't target Russian entities, exacerbates the problem, making it a lucrative and challenging area for law enforcement to combat.</p>

          <p>A strong geomagnetic storm forecast for Sunday night could make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center detected a solar flare associated with the storm. The storm, spurred by a coronal mass ejection, could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. While the ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event, making for optimal viewing conditions in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>
