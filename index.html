          <p>Florida State Representative Joe Casello has passed away at the age of 73 after suffering a heart attack. Before entering politics, Casello served for three decades as a firefighter in Massachusetts and later became a city commissioner in Boynton Beach, Florida. First elected to the state House in 2018, he was remembered by colleagues for his kindness, humor, and dedicated service. Under state law, Governor Ron DeSantis must now call a special election to fill the vacant legislative seat.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry had a frightening moment during a concert in San Francisco when a large butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. The device suddenly dropped, causing a visible panic before the seasoned performer composed herself and continued the show. The incident drew concern from fans online regarding the safety of such elaborate stage equipment flying over the audience. This event follows other on-stage disruptions at her concerts, including a fan who stormed the stage during a previous show in Australia.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as Operation Valkyrie, is being commemorated. The attempt, led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, failed when a bomb he planted in a briefcase did not kill the dictator, leading to the execution of about 200 conspirators. While the plotters were initially seen as traitors, their legacy has evolved, and they are now largely viewed as heroes of the German resistance. However, historians note the conspirators' complex motivations, which were tied to Germany's looming military defeat rather than purely democratic ideals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Justice Department to request the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, but simultaneously labeled those demanding transparency as "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." The move follows public pressure on his administration's handling of the case. A former federal prosecutor expressed skepticism, suggesting that grand jury transcripts are often a high-level summary and may not reveal significant new information compared to the full case file. Trump, who once socialized with Epstein, has never been accused of wrongdoing in the case.</p>

After the match, Curry gave a notably terse and stoic interview, seemingly responding to prior criticism of his form. His dominant play, alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, was a key factor in the Lions' win, though the team's performance dipped after he was substituted.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in the town of George that killed 34 construction workers last year was "entirely preventable." The investigation found multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the ignoring of serious safety concerns like structural cracks, which were noted a year before the tragedy. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that work should have been stopped and called for criminal accountability for those found negligent. A separate police investigation is ongoing, but no arrests have been made.</p>

          <p>A pregnant stay-at-home mom's call to "The Ramsey Show" about paying off a car loan quickly evolved into a discussion about her husband's spending habits and potential addiction. The caller revealed that despite a $156,000 household income, her husband's spending of up to $700 a month on tobacco and marijuana left them struggling to afford groceries. Hosts Dave Ramsey and Jade Warshaw pressed the caller to confront the real issue, questioning whether it was a budgeting problem or a serious addiction that required intervention rather than financial adjustments.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially expected. Muncy, who was injured in early July, has already begun running and swinging a bat, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting his return could be "a lot sooner than anticipated." The slugger's absence has been deeply felt, as the Dodgers' offense has struggled, averaging less than three runs per game since he was sidelined. Muncy expressed relief that the injury was not more severe and is confident it will not significantly impact his swing upon his return.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges involved in the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro for an alleged coup attempt. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is seen as an escalation of the White House's support for Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the action as "unacceptable interference" and an "affront to national sovereignty." The visa revocations follow President Trump's earlier threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports over the supposed persecution of his ally.</p>

This suggests a market that is willing to dig deeper into corporate results. The analysis also notes that while the impact of tariffs on inflation appears manageable for now, it remains a key factor to watch. (not investment advice)</p>

This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach, who advises young people to find the intersection of their passion, their skills, and what the world values. The key to success, according to Galloway, is not blindly following a passion but enduring rejection and embracing opportunities to pivot toward your strengths.</p>
