Frontman Chris Martin fostered an incredible sense of unity, making the crowd an integral part of the performance through LED wristbands and playful banter. This successful, albeit bittersweet, final London date precedes a planned hiatus and Martin's announcement that their next album will be their last, after which they intend to focus solely on touring.</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, the widow of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, asserted that her late husband's message and mission would become "stronger, bolder, louder and greater than ever" following his fatal shooting. Speaking from his Turning Point USA office, she attributed his death to his preaching patriotism, faith, and God's love, warning "evildoers" of the fire they ignited. Mrs. Kirk thanked law enforcement, Vice President JD Vance, and President Donald Trump, while also using the platform to rally young people to join Turning Point USA chapters. She emphasized that her husband's struggle was spiritual, not merely political, in a speech that underlined his polarizing views.</p>

          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has strongly criticized Democratic Farmington Board of Education Chairman Bill Beckert for allegedly celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder by reposting a comment, "They Reap What They Sow." State GOP Chairman Ben Proto denounced Beckert's action as a "grotesque" and "chilling reaction," arguing it implicitly endorses political violence and undermines the values expected of a public servant. Proto emphasized that Kirk's beliefs were rooted in faith and patriotism, never advocating for violence, contrasting this with Beckert's perceived stance. This incident underscores the deep and often acrimonious political divisions that have intensified following Kirk's death, prompting calls for community reflection on leadership.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer initially defended Lord Mandelson, the former UK ambassador to the US, at Prime Minister's Questions, unaware of supportive emails between Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein, according to BBC understanding. Officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office, however, were aware of a media inquiry detailing these messages. Lord Mandelson was subsequently sacked after the full emails, which expressed support for Epstein before his prison sentence, were published, with Downing Street citing "new information." This incident has intensified pressure on Sir Keir regarding his handling of Mandelson's appointment, raising questions about internal communication and vetting processes.</p>

          <p>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a leader of the Belarusian opposition, claimed that dozens of political prisoners released by Belarus in a US-brokered deal were forcibly deported, not truly freed. The release of 52 prisoners was part of an agreement to lift sanctions on Belarus' national airline, following a meeting between White House envoy John Coale and President Aleksandr Lukashenko. While some ex-prisoners thanked former US President Donald Trump for his role, others expressed a desire to remain in Belarus, especially as many were nearing the end of their sentences. Tsikhanouskaya urged Western governments to demand that Lukashenko allow political prisoners to stay in their home country, highlighting the complex human rights situation.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a new congressional redistricting plan, supported by President Trump, which aims to create an additional Republican-leaning House seat. The map, now awaiting Governor Mike Kehoe's signature, would reconfigure the Kansas City area, making a long-held Democratic district more conservative. This move is part of a broader nationwide redistricting effort by Republicans to maintain their slim House majority in upcoming midterm elections. Critics, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have labeled the new maps as "rigged" and unconstitutional, with legal challenges already filed citing concerns about racial gerrymandering and the timing of the redistricting.</p>

          <p>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study found that women who experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders face a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Analyzing 20 years of data from over 66,000 nurses, researchers observed a 41% increased risk for those stalked and a 70% increased risk for those with restraining orders. The study, published in Circulation, highlights that these experiences of violence are independent risk factors, even after accounting for diet and exercise. This research suggests that medical screenings for heart health should consider incorporating questions about stalking and protective orders to improve women's health outcomes.</p>

The chatbot also provided contradictory information about the suspect's political affiliation and even falsely reported Kirk was alive.

          <p>Charlie Kirk significantly contributed to Donald Trump's 2024 election victory by mobilizing younger voters, a demographic traditionally dominated by Democrats. Through social media outreach and his Turning Point USA organization, Kirk helped Trump improve his performance with voters under 30, including drawing even with Kamala Harris among young men. John Della Volpe of Harvard Kennedy School noted Kirk's success in persuading an older generation to invest in youth outreach. Despite controversies, Kirk's efforts, including the "Ballot Chasers" program in battleground states, were credited by Trump and his campaign for helping secure the win.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for Charlie Kirk's assassination, Utah Governor Spencer Cox addressed the political fallout, urging against immediate partisan blame. Cox, known for seeking common ground, emphasized that one person is responsible for the murder, countering early speculation by Donald Trump blaming the "radical left." Details emerged that Robinson, from a pro-Trump area, had become more political and disliked Kirk's viewpoints. Inscribed bullet casings with phrases like "Hey fascist! Catch!" and gaming references suggest a complex, online-influenced motive. Cox implored the public to disengage from online narratives, likening the trauma to JFK's assassination and urging de-escalation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to terminate a federal program that tracks greenhouse gas emissions from over 8,000 industrial facilities, including power plants and oil refineries. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated this move would save American businesses $2.4 billion in regulatory costs while still complying with the Clean Air Act. However, environmental and health experts warn that ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would blind the public to climate pollution data, hindering policy decisions and jeopardizing public health. Critics argue it aligns with efforts to cut climate research and makes it harder to assess environmental impacts.</p>

          <p>A new report by House Republicans is escalating scrutiny on US-China academic collaborations, identifying approximately 50 joint education programs as "high-risk" and advocating for their termination. These partnerships, including those involving New York University and Johns Hopkins, are deemed problematic due to concerns they could bolster Beijing’s military and technological advancements. The "high-risk" designation applies to programs with ties to China's "seven sons of national defense" or other military-focused entities. This initiative signifies a hardening stance in the House Republicans' campaign to curb academic ties that are perceived as posing national security threats to the United States.</p>

Serrano described Trump, whom he photographed in 2004, as "fascinating" and "the epitome of the American dream," collecting over 1,000 Trump-related items for an art installation.

Despite having lived in the US for 17 years, paying taxes, and having a US citizen daughter, she and her husband face the threat of deportation. Tom Homan, President Trump's border tsar, defends the policy as prioritizing public safety and national security, stating that those who "cheated the system" must leave. This crackdown has forced Luz's family to consider leaving everything behind to move back to Mexico, highlighting the profound human impact of the administration's strict immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A review of "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel struggles to recapture the satirical brilliance of its 1984 predecessor, "This Is Spinal Tap." While seeing Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls reunite offers low-wattage smiles, the inclusion of power cameos like Paul McCartney and Elton John diminishes the original's outsider comedy. The film is criticized for coasting on nostalgia and rehashing old gags, such as the drummer mortality problem, without fresh comedic insight. Despite agreeable silliness in early scenes depicting their solo lives, the overall consensus is that some classics are better left untouched, as the sequel fails to hit "11."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending legal protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision lifts a district court's stay, allowing the administration to revoke humanitarian parole for these groups while litigation continues. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, which argues these protections were temporary and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them. Critics, however, warn of "irreparable harm" and the potential for the "largest mass illegalization event in modern American history," as many affected individuals have established lives in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing giant discriminates against passengers with disabilities, including those with service dogs. The Department of Justice claims Uber drivers routinely refuse service, impose illegal cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and charge cancellation fees after denials. Disabled individuals have reportedly missed appointments and been stranded due to these issues. Uber states it prohibits such discrimination and takes action against violators, but disagrees with the lawsuit's allegations.

Proponents argue these drastic measures are essential to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it's an overreach that strips local authorities of control.
