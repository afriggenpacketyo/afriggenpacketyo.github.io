          <p>President Trump signed an executive order mandating proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration and ballot review by Election Day.  This action has drawn immediate criticism from election experts who argue it would disenfranchise millions of voters.  The order also directs changes to the federal voter registration form and attempts to prevent states from counting late mail-in ballots.</p>
