          <p>Pop singer Charli XCX has officially confirmed her marriage to George Daniel, the drummer for the band The 1975. Speculation about their wedding began after a passerby filmed them posing for photos at Hackney Town Hall in London. The singer later verified the news through a series of lighthearted social media posts, celebrating the occasion with her new husband. The couple, who have been together for several years and announced their engagement in 2023, have also collaborated professionally on music, including on Charli XCX's critically acclaimed recent album.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offensive Surge Insufficient as Pitching Falters in Loss to Brewers</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense showed signs of life, scoring seven runs, but it was not enough to overcome pitching struggles in an 8-7 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite a four-run rally and late-game home runs from Tommy Edman and Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers failed to capitalize on key opportunities, leaving runners in scoring position. Starter Emmet Sheehan had a difficult outing, and the bullpen allowed crucial late runs, leading to the team's ninth loss in their last eleven games. The defeat highlights ongoing issues with converting offensive production into consistent wins.</p>

          <p>Intense sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups in southern Syria have persisted despite a ceasefire declared by the country's interim president. Reports indicate Druze fighters pushed Bedouin gunmen out of the city of Suweida, but fighting continues elsewhere in the province, with over 900 people reportedly killed in the past week. The Syrian government deployed forces to quell the violence, but they have been accused of participating in attacks. International figures, including the U.S. Secretary of State, have called for an end to the violence and for accountability for atrocities.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals listed as missing after recent devastating floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. The update follows extensive verification efforts by local and state agencies, which confirmed that most of the previously unaccounted-for people are safe. The severe flooding, which occurred around July 4, resulted in 134 deaths across Texas, with 107 of those fatalities in Kerr County alone. The reduction in the number of missing persons marks a moment of relief amidst the ongoing recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are set to severely impact small, rural radio stations that are not NPR members but rely heavily on Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) grants. Stations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote areas in West Virginia and Virginia, depend on this funding for over half their budget and provide essential local news, emergency information, and community programming. The cuts, pushed by the Trump administration over perceived political bias, threaten the existence of these stations, which often serve as the primary source of daily information in areas with limited internet and cell service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the persistent failure to achieve peace in global conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a deep-seated crisis in the global moral order. The author contends that the rise of moral relativism has eroded universal ethical standards, making it nearly impossible to mediate disputes or hold perpetrators of atrocities accountable. Without an agreed-upon framework of right and wrong, political and military conflicts descend into endless cycles of violence and polarization. The piece suggests that a return to shared responsibilities and universal principles is essential for any meaningful progress toward peace.</p>

However, prosecutors argued she shot him twice in the head while he was sleeping. The second trial resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of 40 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>In the 2016 murder investigation of Nicole Vander Heyden in Wisconsin, her boyfriend Doug Detrie was initially the prime suspect until his Fitbit data proved he was home during the time of the crime. This technological alibi shifted the investigation, which then used DNA evidence from the victim's sock to identify a new suspect, George Steven Burch. Authorities further solidified their case against Burch using Google Dashboard data from his phone, which tracked his movements to the crime scene and other key locations. Burch was subsequently convicted of the murder, highlighting how personal tech data can be pivotal in both exonerating the innocent and convicting the guilty.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, mandatory "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is intended to be paid upon visa issuance. According to the provision, travelers may be able to get the fee reimbursed after their visa expires if they comply with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, significant questions remain about the implementation and reimbursement process, leading some experts to advise clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable for planning purposes.

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn a recent arson attack on the historic Church of St. George. Residents have blamed extremist Israeli settlers for the fire, which is part of a surge in settler violence since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Huckabee, typically a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and insisted that the perpetrators must be found and prosecuted. His visit highlights the escalating tensions and violence in the region.</p>
