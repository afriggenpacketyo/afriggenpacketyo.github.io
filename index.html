          <p>SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated that crypto innovation has been stifled due to the current regulatory framework, emphasizing the need for change. Speaking at the SEC's Crypto Task Force roundtable, Atkins suggested a shift from an adversarial to a collaborative approach. His remarks come after the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, signaling a potential new era for crypto regulation. The crypto industry played a significant role in President Trump's election victory, underscoring its importance in the political landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in federal court to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, potentially facing the death penalty. He is separately charged in New York state court with the same crime. Prosecutors argue Thompson's killing was ideologically motivated by Mangione's anger toward the health insurance industry. Mangione's lawyers have asked the court to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, claiming it violates his rights.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Argentina's MercadoLibre believes the U.S.-China trade war presents a significant opportunity for Latin America. He noted that many American companies have already moved their manufacturing operations to Mexico from China and other Asian countries. Mexico has a free trade agreement with the U.S. that means some imports from the country are exempt from Trump's tariffs of as much as 25% on Mexican goods. (not investment advice)</p>
