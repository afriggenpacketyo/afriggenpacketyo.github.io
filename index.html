          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks, which claimed its "Mindful Blend" range could help consumers feel calm and reduce stress. The watchdog found these claims were not authorized under rules for marketing health benefits in food and drink. The ruling also noted that claims about magnesium's effect on cortisol and the product's "0g added sugar" label were misleading. Trip has removed the claims, which were made for a product line that, unlike its main range, does not contain CBD.</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump's economic agenda, particularly his use of high tariffs, arguing it rests on fundamental misunderstandings of trade and labor. The author contends that trade deficits are not inherently losses and that tariffs on industrial inputs harm U.S. manufacturers. Furthermore, the piece asserts that with near-historic low unemployment, the U.S. lacks the idle workforce needed to fill jobs in newly protected industries, a problem the administration's proposed solutions, like removing people from Medicaid, cannot realistically solve.

          <p>Thai police have arrested a woman for allegedly extorting money from at least nine senior Buddhist monks after luring them into sexual relationships. The scandal has prompted the monks to be disrobed, as their celibacy vows were violated. The woman allegedly received nearly $12 million over three years, which she reportedly spent on online gambling, after blackmailing the monks. The case has highlighted issues of financial transparency within Thai temples and led the government to consider tightening laws to restore public faith in Buddhism.</p>

          <p>Clashes have intensified in the southern Syrian city of Sweida after a ceasefire between government forces and local Druze armed groups failed. In response to the fighting and reported attacks on the Druze minority, Israel has conducted airstrikes near Syria's Ministry of Defense in Damascus and has threatened further escalation. The conflict follows the ousting of Bashar Assad, with the country's new rulers struggling to control territory amid sectarian tensions. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports over 250 casualties, including civilians and soldiers.</p>

          <p>A major spending bill proposed by President Trump introduces significant changes to the federal student loan system, set to take effect in 2026 for new borrowers. The legislation establishes a lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500 and imposes new annual and lifetime caps for graduate students and parents using the Parent PLUS loan program. While some experts believe these limits could curb rising tuition costs, others warn it may shift borrowing to the private market, potentially disadvantaging low-income students who may not qualify for private loans.

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated he is "unable to say for sure" if anyone was killed due to a 2022 data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who aided British forces. The breach, which was kept secret by a super-injunction until recently, involved a British official mistakenly leaking a list of applicants to a UK resettlement scheme. While a special route has relocated 4,500 people, the Ministry of Defence believes hundreds of Afghan soldiers and their families from the list remain in Afghanistan, and the government has apologized for the failure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any "credible" information she has on the Jeffrey Epstein case. The comment comes as Bondi and the administration face a backlash from some MAGA supporters after the Justice Department announced it found no evidence of an Epstein "client list." This has created a rare rift, with key Trump allies like Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene continuing to call for transparency. Trump defended Bondi but also questioned the public's "fascination" with the "sordid but boring" case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate rose to 3.6% in the year to June, its highest level since January 2024 and exceeding economists' expectations. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase to higher prices for food, clothing, and transport, including air and rail fares. While average wages have risen faster than inflation, the increase puts pressure on household budgets and complicates the Bank of England's upcoming decision on interest rates. Despite the higher figure, a rate cut is still widely anticipated at the Bank's next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, the British-Indian athlete widely recognized as the world's oldest marathon runner, has died at the age of 114. He was killed in a hit-and-run incident in his native village in Punjab, India. Known as the "Turbaned Tornado," Singh gained international fame in 2011 when, at age 100, he became the first centenarian to complete a marathon. He had taken up running at 89 to cope with grief and went on to run nine marathons, becoming an inspiration for his determination and athleticism late in life.</p>

          <p>In a series of nationwide drug enforcement operations, U.S. agents have seized over $10 million in cryptocurrency directly tied to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. The seizure was part of a broader crackdown since January that has also netted millions of fentanyl pills and thousands of pounds of fentanyl powder and methamphetamine. This action targets the financial operations of the cartel, which the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist organization. The news comes shortly after a son of kingpin 'El Chapo' Guzman pleaded guilty to drug charges in a U.S. court.</p>

The ban restricts using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens or washing cars.

The move follows similar restrictions by several other UK water companies as the country deals with the effects of dry weather on water supplies.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating strong results driven by market volatility and a rebound in investment banking. The bank is expected to have benefited from increased trading activity in bonds, currencies, and stocks, spurred by President Trump's tariff policies. Additionally, a recovery in asset values is predicted to boost its investment banking and asset management divisions. These factors highlight how Goldman's business model can generate significant returns during periods of market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of French automaker Renault fell by as much as 17% after the company reduced its 2025 financial targets and announced a change in leadership. Renault lowered its operating margin forecast and its free cash-flow goal, citing pressures from muted European demand and rising competition. The company also appointed its CFO, Duncan Minto, as interim CEO following the recent abrupt resignation of Luca de Meo. The profit warning sent the stock to a 52-week low and is seen by analysts as a significant blow to investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>
