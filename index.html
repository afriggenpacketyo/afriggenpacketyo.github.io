          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has initiated legal action to challenge President Trump's executive order placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The lawsuit argues that the move is an unlawful overreach of presidential authority, violating the district's right to self-governance under the Home Rule Act. Officials are seeking a court order to block the federal takeover and affirm local control over the police force, stating the action endangers residents and infringes upon constitutional principles of separated powers.</p>

          <p>Epping Forest District Council is seeking a High Court injunction to stop The Bell Hotel from housing asylum seekers, citing risks to public safety amid rising community tensions. The legal action follows large protests, some involving violence, after a resident was charged with sexual assault. The council argues the hotel's use has changed without proper planning notification, creating local anxiety. Lawyers for the hotel owners contend that an injunction would cause hardship for asylum seekers and set a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is on the brink of collapse after the government decided against providing a rescue package. The country's two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus, warned that closures are imminent following a US-UK trade deal that removed tariffs on imported American ethanol, rendering their businesses unviable. The government stated that direct funding was not in the national interest and would not solve the industry's long-term issues. This decision puts hundreds of direct jobs and thousands more in the supply chain at risk.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Federal Aviation Administration data shows that in the year before January's fatal midair collision over Washington, D.C., helicopters frequently violated altitude limits near Reagan National Airport. The data, released as part of the NTSB investigation, reveals almost daily instances of helicopters flying too close to airplanes, with one in ten exceeding the 200-foot altitude restriction on their route. This pattern suggests that such dangerous operations may have become normalized, raising questions about why the significant risk was not identified and addressed before the tragic crash occurred.</p>

The wait time for concealed carry permits has been reduced from several months to an average of five days by improving administrative efficiency without altering local gun laws. This initiative, led by the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," also allows for next-day and walk-in appointments for firearm registration, aiming to help law-abiding residents more easily obtain the means to protect themselves.</p>

          <p>A research team at Tianjin University in China has developed a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram, more than double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells. The team has established a pilot production line for the battery, which could significantly extend the range of electric vehicles and alleviate "range anxiety" for consumers. If successfully scaled, this technological breakthrough could also dramatically increase the endurance of drones and other electric devices. The new battery has also demonstrated strong resilience and stability in safety tests.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered 31 shipwrecks at the bottom of Germany's Lake Constance, including the suspected hulls of two large paddle steamers, one of which is believed to have been sunk during a World War II air raid. The "Wrecks and Deep Sea" project utilized remote-operated vehicles to survey the lake bed, also uncovering a remarkably well-preserved cargo sailing ship. These findings offer valuable insights into historical shipbuilding and maritime technology.

          <p>A record number of 18-year-olds in the UK have been accepted into their first-choice university this year, with over 226,000 securing their "firm" offer. This trend is attributed to several factors, including strong A-level results and a larger demographic cohort. However, it is also driven by financial pressures on universities, which are facing a decline in international student enrollment and are therefore more inclined to accept domestic students to ensure financial stability. This has led to a competitive Clearing process, with many institutions offering incentives to fill remaining spots.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers, who left the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps, have indicated they will return as the first special session adjourns. The move was praised by former President Barack Obama as a courageous stand against gerrymandering. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to call another immediate session to pass the new maps, which were requested by Donald Trump and aim to create five new Republican-held seats. The Democrats' return is contingent on California introducing its own new map to counteract the Republican gains.</p>

          <p>A new report from Climate Power reveals that Republican lawmakers who voted for a recent anti-environment bill have accepted more than $105 million in career donations from the fossil fuel industry. The legislation, signed by President Trump, provides billions in benefits to oil and gas companies while rolling back clean energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. The analysis highlights the financial ties between the industry and politicians who supported the bill, including some from districts that have benefited from green energy jobs, raising concerns about the influence of industry donations on policy.</p>

          <p>Sana Javeri Kadri, who founded Diaspora Co. to create a more equitable and sustainable spice trade, is now facing a significant challenge from new U.S. tariffs on Indian products. Her company, which sources high-quality, fresh spices directly from regenerative farms in India and Sri Lanka, is built on a model of paying farmers a living wage. The proposed 50% tariff could cost her company hundreds of thousands of dollars, forcing price increases and threatening the viability of her mission-driven business. This highlights how trade policy can disproportionately affect small businesses focused on ethical sourcing.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are forming arts collectives and dedicating their time to writing poetry, exploring human expression alongside their rigorous scientific and engineering studies. This article reflects on why these future technologists are drawn to the ancient art form, suggesting it serves as a vital counterbalance to a world increasingly focused on AI and optimization. Poetry offers a unique way to preserve the complexity of inner lives and foster human connection, acting as a technology of memory and empathy that prediction-based AI cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley" sheds light on the late singer-songwriter's life, with a particular focus on his often-overlooked Latino heritage through his Panamanian-American mother, Mary Guibert. The film intimately portrays his story through the women who knew him best, challenging the long-standing media narrative that centered on his estranged father, folk singer Tim Buckley. Guibert shares stories of raising Jeff in a Latino household, providing a new dimension to the understanding of the artist whose only studio album, "Grace," continues to gain new fans decades after his tragic death.</p>

          <p>Intense monsoon rains have triggered devastating flash floods and landslides across northern Pakistan and India-administered Kashmir, leading to the deaths of more than 170 people. In Pakistan, at least 116 people have died, and a rescue helicopter crashed, killing five crew members. In Kashmir, a remote village crowded with pilgrims was hit, killing at least 60, with hundreds more missing. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of these extreme weather events, known as cloudbursts, to climate change, with the impact worsened by unplanned development in mountainous regions.</p>

The program, which supports nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, which would force a significant reduction in benefits if Congress does not act. Concurrently, critics have raised concerns about staffing cuts under the Trump administration, questioning the agency's ability to serve a growing number of retirees.
