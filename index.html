        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at a university event in Utah has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum. Figures from former President Trump, who called Kirk a "legendary" figure, to former Presidents Biden, Obama, and Clinton denounced the act as heinous and called for an end to political violence. While most reactions urged national unity and civility, a moment of silence on the House floor was briefly disrupted by arguments over gun control, highlighting the deep political tensions underlying the calls for peace.</p>

          <p>Authorities are conducting a manhunt for the shooter who killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA was hit by a single shot fired from a distance, in what Utah's governor has termed a "political assassination." The campus was closed and an investigation involving local and federal law enforcement is ongoing, but a suspect remains at large. The event has sparked shock and condemnation from political leaders nationwide.</p>

          <p>A student opened fire with a handgun at Evergreen High School near Denver, injuring two other students before fatally shooting himself. Authorities responded within minutes of receiving 911 calls and found the suspect with self-inflicted wounds; no officers fired their weapons. One of the victims was reported to be in critical condition. The incident, which occurred during lunchtime, caused chaos as students fled, and has prompted the cancellation of classes for the remainder of the week.</p>

This rally mirrors overnight gains on Wall Street, reflecting broader market optimism based on cooling U.S. inflation data and renewed hopes for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later in the year.

          <p>A home in Los Angeles's Fairfax District, surrounded by bags of trash, has become a point of contention among residents. While some view the property as a public health and fire hazard, others defend the homeowner, a 71-year-old veteran, stating he is engaged in a meticulous recycling operation for income. Friends and some neighbors are calling for understanding and a compassionate solution rather than public shaming, arguing that the intense media and city attention has only isolated the resident further.</p>

Its opening dramatically reduces travel time between the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou from over an hour to just 20 minutes. The bridge features a unique asymmetrical design to balance the weight of the railway and roadway, marking a significant engineering achievement.</p>

          <p>Following a successful first day of trading, financial commentator Jim Cramer suggested that shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Klarna are still a worthwhile purchase. He noted that while the stock saw significant gains after its IPO, its valuation has not yet reached excessive levels. Cramer pointed to the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and strong automated underwriting standards as positive indicators for its future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers have introduced legislation to significantly alter Los Angeles's Measure ULA, a tax on high-value property sales intended to fund homeless services. The bill aims to address criticisms that the tax has stifled housing construction by reducing the tax rate for newly built apartment buildings and commercial properties. This move is part of a larger political strategy to prevent a statewide tax-cut initiative, which would nullify ULA entirely, from reaching the ballot next year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the sharp decline in commissions for traditional "stand and stir" cooking shows on television, contrasting it with the boom in food content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. While TV production is slow and regulated, online creators can react nimbly to trends, build direct community engagement, and offer a rawer, more authentic style that appeals to younger audiences. This shift reflects a broader cultural challenge for legacy media as viewers increasingly favor the immediacy and relatability of online content.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation alleges that the international charity SOS Children's Villages International was complicit in the disappearance of children of political detainees under Syria's Assad regime. Leaked documents and whistleblower testimony suggest the charity's Syrian branch, influenced by the Assad family, held children in orphanages, changed their identities, and prevented relatives from contacting them. The charity has acknowledged taking in undocumented children and expressed regret, but families are still struggling to find their missing loved ones.</p>

The strategy involves packaging not just advanced chips but also algorithms and applications to create a comprehensive American AI ecosystem globally.

          <p>The UK's Treasury Committee has warned that government reforms to the Lifetime ISA (LISA) program are insufficient and too slow, urging more significant changes in the upcoming budget. MPs raised concerns that the product, designed to help people save for a first home or retirement, is being mis-sold and is unsuitable for some, particularly those who may become eligible for benefits. The committee also questioned if the LISA is a good use of taxpayer money, as it is forecast to cost £3 billion over five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating the "dark DNA" of Australia's peacock spiders to understand their remarkable diversity, which includes over 100 different species. This mysterious part of the genetic code, which consists of non-gene sections of DNA, is believed to enable the spiders to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By studying this extreme case of variation, scientists hope to uncover general principles about how biodiversity is generated in the natural world as part of a larger project to sequence all life on Earth.</p>
