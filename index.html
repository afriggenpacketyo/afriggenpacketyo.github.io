          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned from his position as chairman of Reform UK, stating that dedicating his time to getting the party elected is no longer a worthwhile endeavor. Yusuf's resignation follows his criticism of a Reform UK MP's call to ban the burka, which he deemed "dumb." Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, expressed regret over Yusuf's departure, acknowledging his significant contributions to the party's recent electoral successes, including a by-election win and increased council representation. Yusuf, a former banker and Conservative Party member, had been instrumental in professionalizing the party and attracting donors after becoming chairman 11 months ago; his resignation has prompted speculation about internal tensions within Reform UK. The professionalization he brought to Reform UK will have a lasting legacy.</p>

          <p>Canada has reported a record trade deficit following President Trump's imposition of tariffs, specifically a 25% tariff on automobiles. The tariffs have significantly impacted the Canadian automotive industry, leading to a nearly 23% plunge in vehicle exports in April. This economic downturn underscores the immediate and direct consequences of the trade policies implemented by the Trump administration, which are designed to protect domestic industries but have triggered retaliatory measures and economic disruption in key trading partner nations. The situation highlights the complex interplay between international trade, tariffs, and national economies. The tariffs are having a detrimental impact on Canada's economy.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the recent attack on a march for Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, faces 118 state criminal charges, including 28 counts of attempted murder. The charges are related to the Molotov cocktails he allegedly used during the attack, which injured 15 people and a dog. Soliman is currently held on a $10 million bond and is also facing federal hate crime charges in a separate federal court case. The incident occurred during a weekly march through the Pearl Street Mall by the group Run for Their Lives, advocating for the release of Israeli hostages taken to Gaza; this attack has sparked community outrage and legal action.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are engaged in a public feud, with Trump criticizing Musk's opposition to his budget bill and threatening to terminate government contracts with Musk's companies. Musk responded by questioning Trump's achievements and suggesting support for his impeachment. The dispute began after Musk criticized the bill for its high cost, leading Trump to accuse him of opposing it due to provisions affecting electric vehicle incentives. This escalating conflict has led to significant volatility in Tesla's stock price and raises concerns about the future of government-business relations under the Trump administration. The angry swipe came after Musk blasted the president amid an escalating clash stemming from the mega-billionaire's vocal opposition to Trump's massive budget bill.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted on felony gun charges, is under review by the Justice Department. This action, taken during Biden's final weeks in office, stands out as the only pardon he personally signed, amid concerns about his use of an autopen for other clemency grants. Special Counsel David Weiss criticized Biden's characterization of the Hunter Biden investigation as "selective" and "unfair," further fueling the controversy. The investigation into the autopen use is being led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, raising questions about the legitimacy of other presidential actions. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a sharp decline after a public dispute erupted between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump, who suggested revoking federal contracts from Musk's companies. The stock fell by as much as 18% during trading, wiping out a significant portion of Tesla's market value. The conflict stemmed from Musk's criticism of Trump's budget bill, which he labeled a "disgusting abomination" due to its high cost. This public spat has created uncertainty among investors and raised concerns about the future of Tesla's relationship with the government. The public dispute between the two "is sending shivers down the backs of Tesla investors," Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told CBS MoneyWatch.</p>

Despite exceeding Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings, the company is facing challenges related to tariffs and concerns about a potential economic slowdown in the U.S. Other retailers have also adjusted their outlooks due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff regime, leading to increased prices and reduced profit forecasts. Lululemon's report comes after a string of retailers reduced or withdrew their guidance and said they would hike prices because of uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff regime. The activewear company expects to post earnings per share in the range of $2.85 to $2.90 for the second quarter, compared to Wall Street's expectation of $3.29, according to LSEG.

The proclamation cites terrorism threats and visa overstay statistics as justification for Afghanistan's inclusion. Trump cited the need to address the threat of terrorism as the catalyst for the travel ban, with the White House fact sheet noting specifically about Afghanistan: "The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan. Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures."</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a heated exchange on social media, with Trump criticizing Musk's opposition to his bill and Musk accusing Trump of ingratitude. The back-and-forth escalated as the day went on, with both figures making personal comments and questioning each other's motivations. The dispute stems from Musk's criticism of the bill's cost and Trump's claim that Musk is upset about the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles. At one point, Musk responded to a user: "Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate." The White House declined to comment.</p>
