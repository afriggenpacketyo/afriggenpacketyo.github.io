          <p>UK newspapers prominently featured US President Donald Trump's suggestion during his state visit that Britain should deploy its military to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Many headlines focused on this controversial advice, which would exceed the government's current plans. Reports also covered Trump's meeting with Sir Keir Starmer, noting his efforts to maintain a positive tone and avoid escalating tensions during the visit. The media's coverage underscored the complex dynamics of the US-UK diplomatic exchange.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) voted to keep its policy rate steady at 0.5%, aligning with economic forecasts, as Japan's core inflation rate fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest since November 2024. This marks a third consecutive month of decline, with headline inflation also dropping. The BOJ acknowledged moderately rising inflation expectations due to food prices, but anticipates these effects will wane. Despite a 7-2 majority vote, some dissenters proposed a rate hike, while analysts foresee a potential hike by October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of individuals, including New York City and state officials, were arrested during an anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstration at 26 Federal Plaza in Downtown Manhattan. Protesters conducted a sit-in, objecting to the treatment of detainees and demanding oversight of conditions at the facility. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and other lawmakers stated they were attempting to conduct oversight following a preliminary injunction ruling. DHS, however, called the protest a "stunt" endangering personnel and contributing to assaults on ICE officers.</p>

          <p>The UK government and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's team are reportedly "delighted and relieved" after successfully navigating US President Donald Trump's state visit. Despite differing political instincts, Starmer managed to channel Trump's disagreements, preventing public clashes. The article highlights the British strategy of using state visits for soft power and maintaining relations with an unpredictable ally. The government hopes this visit signals a normalizing relationship with the Trump administration, allowing for smoother diplomatic engagement, even as key policy disagreements remain.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Environmental and Health Risks from Discarded COVID-19 Face Masks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the "disturbing impact" of billions of discarded COVID-19 face masks, identifying them as significant environmental pollutants and potential public health threats. The study found that both disposable surgical masks and filtering face pieces shed microplastics and dangerous chemicals like bisphenol B and sulfosuccinate into water. These substances can disrupt human hormones, harm aquatic life, and persist in the environment for decades. The findings underscore an urgent need for safer mask designs and improved waste management systems to mitigate long-term ecological and health damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lara Adekoya, owner of Fleurs et Sel, an L.A. cookie shop, is facing significant financial strain due to President Trump's tariffs on imported ingredients. She reports paying $3,000 to $4,000 extra monthly for premium supplies, absorbing these costs herself to avoid raising customer prices. Two lower federal courts have deemed these "reciprocal" tariffs illegal, with the Trump administration appealing to the Supreme Court. Experts warn that if upheld, these tariffs could grant the president unlimited authority and prove "not survivable" for many small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents in central Berlin were evacuated after an unexploded World War II bomb was found in the Spree River during construction work. Police established a 500-meter security perimeter in the densely populated area, opening emergency shelters for those displaced. Bomb disposal experts plan to defuse the device early Friday morning, a complex operation due to its submerged location. This incident, which halted ship traffic and suspended subway service, marks one of Berlin's largest evacuations in recent years for unexploded ordnance.</p>

          <p>Forestry England predicts an exceptionally vibrant autumn foliage display across the UK this year, thanks to a very warm and sunny summer. The abundant sunshine enabled trees to produce more sugars in their leaves, which will translate into brighter reds, oranges, and golds as chlorophyll production decreases. While some trees experienced a "false autumn" due to drought, recent rainfall has aided recovery. Experts suggest that continued warm days and cool, dry nights through September could result in one of the most flamboyant autumns in recent memory.</p>
