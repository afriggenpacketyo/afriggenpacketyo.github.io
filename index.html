            <p>Golf influencer Paige Spiranac addressed recent criticism regarding her choice of attire on the golf course, particularly a tight one-piece outfit she wore while practicing. Spiranac, known for her unapologetic style, expressed surprise at the negative comments, considering the outfit to be relatively conservative. She defended her fashion choices by explaining that she grew up wearing workout clothes due to financial constraints and feels comfortable in such attire. Spiranac has previously spoken out against the hypocrisy of online reactions to men showing off their bodies compared to the scrutiny she faces. (not investment advice)</p>

Van Hollen criticized the Trump administration for flouting the courts and suggested the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis.

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are reportedly considering investing in Alaska LNG, a massive natural gas project, to potentially secure trade deals and avoid high U.S. tariffs. The project involves building a pipeline across Alaska to liquefy gas for export to Asia, with Trump touting it as a national priority. Taiwan's CPC Corp. has already signed a letter of intent to purchase gas and invest in the project, with other Asian nations also expressing interest. The Trump administration sees Alaska LNG as strategically important, offering a direct route to Asia and avoiding chokepoints.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry has attributed the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza to an "operational misunderstanding." The IDF claims its troops believed they were facing a threat and opened fire, but the inquiry found failings, including poor night visibility. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report. The IDF also stated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but did not provide evidence. The report contrasts with initial claims that the convoy approached suspiciously without lights, which was later refuted by video evidence.</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes a significant restructuring of the State Department, including reductions in sub-Saharan operations and the elimination of bureaus related to climate, refugees, and human rights. The changes would reorganize the department into four regional bureaus and close some embassies in Africa. The order also aims to streamline mission delivery and cut waste, with new hiring criteria prioritizing alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called the report "fake news," other internal documents propose budget cuts and embassy closures.</p>

The incident occurred on the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, with the boat believed to be carrying around 400 people. According to Congolese police, the fire is believed to have been ignited by cooking onboard the vessel. Boat accidents are common in Congo due to overcrowding and lack of safety measures, as many Congolese choose to travel by boat due to inadequate road infrastructure.</p>

Analysts agree that prolonged tariffs could increase sales of used devices, particularly smartphones. While most Americans prefer new devices, tariffs could change this preference.

The ACLU argued that the men were at risk of being sent to a horrific foreign prison without a chance to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted hastily and prematurely. The White House claimed the men were "foreign terrorists" arrested in planned raids.

The intercepts, which took off from Malbork Air Base in Poland, were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing.

Recent reports from Walmart, Amazon, major banks, and Paychex suggest a fundamentally healthy economy, but continued monitoring is essential. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The author recounts a story from 30 years ago when she told a date that she drove a Land Rover, a lie she now finds truly weird and dumb. The reflection is prompted by a new dating show, The Honesty Box, which uses lie detection technology. The author explores the prevalence of dishonesty in dating, from catfishing to more serious fabrications, and questions whether all lies are inherently awful. She suggests that some lies may stem from insecurity or a desire to present a better version of oneself, but ultimately acknowledges the importance of honesty in relationships.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is entering the final phase of its antitrust case against Google, arguing for remedies to address the company's monopolistic behavior. The government seeks to stop Google from making third-party payments to ensure its default search position and to spin off its Chrome web browser and possibly sell its Android operating system. Google argues that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation. The outcome of the case could significantly impact the regulation of digital markets and create opportunities for tech startups to compete with Google.</p>

            <p>The author suggests that China should strategically require bilateral trade with the US to be settled in renminbi as a countermeasure to US tariffs. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. The author argues that China's strong manufacturing capabilities and substantial trade volume with the US would force the US to buy large quantities of renminbi. A rising renminbi would also signal economic strength to global investors, encouraging capital inflows to China.</p>
