          <p>Bukayo Saka, the Arsenal winger, was excluded from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra, raising concerns about his fitness. Head coach Thomas Tuchel indicated that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his omission and his physical condition. This absence adds to Saka's challenges, as he has yet to play under Tuchel due to a previous injury that sidelined him for three months. It remains uncertain whether Saka will be available for the friendly match against Senegal, leaving his contribution to the Three Lions in question. The optimism score is based on the fact that Saka is merely missing one game and is not permanently injured.</p>
