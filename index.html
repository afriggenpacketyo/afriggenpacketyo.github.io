          <p>A 14-year-old boy, believed to be Layton Carr, tragically died in a fire at Fairfield industrial park in Gateshead, leaving his school and community devastated. Police have arrested fourteen children aged 11-14 on suspicion of manslaughter, who have since been released on bail as the investigation continues. Tributes, including balloons and messages, have been left at the scene, and a GoFundMe appeal for Layton's mother has raised over £13,000. Local councillors acknowledged residents' long-standing concerns about anti-social behavior at the industrial estate and had visited the site recently.</p>

          <p>Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. The S&P/ASX 200 index edged down 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session, while the Australian dollar depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar. This is despite most Asian markets being closed for public holidays and U.S. futures also trending downwards after a strong week on Wall Street. This move indicates Australians' desire for policy continuity amid the current uncertain macroeconomic outlook.</p>

          <p>Former Playboy model Holly Madison revealed uncomfortable bedroom activities during her time at the Playboy Mansion, expressing distaste for group encounters while describing more intimate moments with Hugh Hefner as surprisingly normal. Madison, now 45, shared that she was initially included in Hefner's will, set to inherit $3 million, but left the mansion before his death in 2017 and earned the same amount independently. She advises young models entering Hollywood to heed cautionary tales and recognize the emotional weight of the industry. Madison is currently hosting the third season of Investigation Discovery’s true-crime series, "The Playboy Murders."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies "produced in foreign lands," citing a "National Security threat" due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. He claims this move will revitalize the American movie industry, which he believes is rapidly declining. This action escalates trade disputes, potentially raising prices and disrupting the global economy. China has already responded by reducing the quota of American movies allowed into the country, which could significantly impact Western studios.</p>

The Bureau of Prisons said it will comply with the Presidential Order, though questions about the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz remain.

          <p>A New York Times analysis examines how President Trump's policies and presence are impacting elections worldwide, with mixed results. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties have gained ground by campaigning against Trump-like policies, while in Singapore, stability during turmoil linked to Trump's trade wars has aided incumbents. However, in Germany, the effect is less direct but still felt, and in Britain, a center-left leader initially praised for handling Trump now faces challenges. These elections suggest a complex global reaction to Trump's policies and leadership style.</p>

Egg freezing offers women the option to postpone having children until they are ready, without the pressure of a ticking biological clock. However, experts caution that it is not a guarantee and involves costs, medical risks, and potential disappointment. The optimal time to freeze eggs is in a woman's 20s, when egg quality is at its peak. Some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, while others are criticized for potentially exploiting women's desire to prioritize their careers.</p>

          <p>According to estimates by estate agency Savills, more than half of first-time buyers in the UK received financial assistance from their families to purchase homes last year. The average contribution from the "bank of mum and dad" was £55,572, provided through loans and gifts. This support enabled young buyers to navigate high mortgage rates and rising rental costs. The report suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received family assistance, slightly lower than the previous year but higher than most years since 2013.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed orders targeting law firms connected to investigations or legal cases related to him or his allies, threatening to bar attorneys from courthouses and cancel contracts of law firm clients. This action has led to accusations of intimidation and an attack on the legal profession, with some comparing it to a protection racket. While four firms are fighting the orders in court, others have reached agreements with Trump, raising concerns about the independence of lawyers and the rule of law. A federal judge has permanently blocked one of the orders, calling it unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline of over 4% after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second consecutive month. The decision to raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June follows a similar increase in May. This action is nearly triple the amount previously forecast by Goldman Sachs, bringing over 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market over two months. The move has raised concerns about an oversupplied oil market and potential economic slowdown, impacting oilfield service firms and major oil companies.</p>
