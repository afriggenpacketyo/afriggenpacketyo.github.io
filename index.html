          <p>Asian markets experienced a significant downturn following a major sell-off on Wall Street, triggered by President Trump's tariff hikes and subsequent backlash from Beijing. Japan's Nikkei 225 index plummeted nearly 8%, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also suffered substantial losses. U.S. stock futures indicated further market weakness, exacerbating concerns about a potential global recession stemming from the escalating trade war between the United States and China.

          <p>President Trump has stated that he will not make a deal with China on tariffs unless the trade deficit between the two countries is resolved. Trump emphasized the need to address the "trillion-dollar trade deficit" with China before considering any agreements regarding his sweeping tariffs. He also mentioned that a potential TikTok deal was hindered by the tariffs, suggesting that easing the tariffs could facilitate the deal's approval. This stance underscores the administration's focus on rectifying trade imbalances as a prerequisite for tariff negotiations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has described the U.S. government's decision to deport a Maryland man to a notorious prison in El Salvador as "wholly lawless." Judge Paula Xinis emphasized the lack of evidence supporting allegations that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 and highlighted a prior immigration judge's order barring his deportation to El Salvador. The Justice Department has suspended the attorney who defended the deportation. This case raises serious questions about due process and immigration enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office created during the civil rights movement to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions. Former leaders of the office worry that its closure could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments and minority communities. The Community Relations Service has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest and has been credited with preventing riots and easing racial tensions. Concerns are rising about the potential impact of its closure on community relations and conflict resolution.</p>

Luna will not trigger her bipartisan discharge petition in light of the agreement. This resolution aims to balance the needs of new parents with the procedural rules of the House.</p>

His comments echo those of other administration officials who have remained steadfast in their support of the tariffs despite the market turmoil. (not investment advice)

          <p>Newly-qualified medical students in the UK are facing uncertainty over their job locations in the NHS, with many being assigned "placeholder jobs" and not knowing their specific placement until weeks before starting work. This has led to anxiety and difficulty in planning their lives. The British Medical Association has accused the government of failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors after increasing medical school places. There are concerns that this uncertainty could lead to doctors moving abroad.</p>
