        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In September, Russia was China's leading supplier of crude oil, a move seen as defiance against U.S. pressure to limit energy reliance on the country. While monthly imports rose, the year-on-year volume saw a 4.3% decrease. Analysts suggest China is unlikely to abandon Russian oil unless the U.S. offers significant concessions, such as removing tariffs and lifting sanctions on Chinese companies. This trade dynamic highlights the complex geopolitical tensions between the three global powers.</p>

          <p>A significant outage in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) US-East-1 region caused widespread disruptions for major websites and online services, including Disney+, Reddit, and various banking and airline platforms. The issue stemmed from DNS problems with DynamoDB, a core database service, highlighting the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers.

In the 1920s, this led to a lack of oversight and groupthink that enabled risky financial practices, an environment echoed in the current administration's regulatory rollbacks and the fusion of corporate interests with political power.

          <p>The perception that bread in countries like France tastes better than in the U.S. is rooted in different production standards and cultural values. In France, a 1993 law mandates that traditional baguettes sold in a boulangerie contain only four ingredients and be made fresh daily, emphasizing time and flavor development. In contrast, American mass-produced bread often contains numerous additives to facilitate speed and convenience, a practice that began in the 20th century and prioritizes efficiency over the artisanal process.</p>

          <h2>Critics Suggest Companies Are Using AI as a Scapegoat for Layoffs</h2>

          <p>While numerous companies have announced job cuts and cited artificial intelligence as the reason, some critics and analysts argue that AI is being used as a "good excuse" for downsizing. They suggest that many firms, particularly those that overhired during the pandemic, are using the rise of AI to conceal other business challenges or miscalculations. Recent labor market data shows little evidence of mass unemployment caused by AI, indicating the technology is more likely a convenient scapegoat than the primary driver of current layoffs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of users are reporting experiences where they believe AI chatbots like ChatGPT have developed sentience, but experts say this is extremely unlikely. Current large language models are designed to mimic human conversation by pattern-matching from vast datasets, which include sci-fi narratives about conscious AI. The column advises users to understand that AI is acting a role, stay grounded by consulting diverse expert opinions, and channel their empathy towards beings we know are conscious and suffering.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress, including decorated military veterans, have expressed outrage over reports of U.S. veterans being arrested or injured by federal agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Incidents in Chicago and Portland have seen veterans, some elderly, facing charges and physical force from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Lawmakers like Senator Tammy Duckworth and Representative Jason Crow condemned the actions as an excessive use of force against citizens peacefully exercising their right to protest.</p>

          <p>Playwrights are increasingly using the stage to explore the existential questions posed by artificial intelligence, examining how the technology reshapes our understanding of consciousness, memory, and what it means to be human. Plays like Lauren Gunderson's "anthropology" and Jordan Harrison's "Marjorie Prime" feature AI replicas of deceased loved ones, forcing characters and audiences to confront whether a person is merely the sum of their data. This new wave of theater uses the inherently human art form to reflect on our increasingly digitalized nature.</p>

          <p>A new longitudinal study by The Trevor Project indicates a significant decline in the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth over a one-year period, with reported rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts increasing sharply. The research highlights that transgender and nonbinary youth are at particularly high risk. The study also found a disturbing rise in the proportion of youth facing pressure to undergo "conversion therapy," linking societal and political pressures directly to negative mental health outcomes for this vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>After experiencing its worst flu season in years, California health officials are cautioning that the upcoming fall and winter could be similarly severe. Troubling signs include an early and intense flu season in Asia and continued low vaccination rates in the U.S. Last year saw the highest number of pediatric flu deaths since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, with a rare and severe brain complication affecting some children. Officials are urging the public to get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19, and RSV to mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>An artillery round exploded mid-air during a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, sending shrapnel onto Interstate 5 and striking a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The incident, which caused no injuries, occurred after state officials had already expressed safety concerns, leading to a temporary closure of the freeway. The premature detonation forced an early end to the exercise, which was part of an event celebrating the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, and has prompted a full investigation.</p>
