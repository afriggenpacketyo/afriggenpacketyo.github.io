          <p>Donald Trump has criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for hindering peace negotiations by refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea. Trump claimed a deal to end the war was "very close," but Zelenskyy's stance would prolong the conflict. This follows US Vice-President JD Vance outlining a vision for a deal involving territorial concessions from both sides. Trump stated he wants the war to end and has "no favorites," while Ukraine insists ceding Crimea is unconstitutional. The article also mentions recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian regions and downgraded London ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, marking the first contraction since late 2020, primarily due to a sharp fall in construction activity. The Bank of Korea had previously warned that 2025 GDP growth would likely fall below its earlier forecast of 1.5%. The economic slowdown is attributed to prolonged political uncertainties, including the impeachment trials of former president Yoon Suk Yeol and prime minister Han Duck-soo, as well as ongoing trade war turmoil, including tariffs on steel and automobiles. The central bank is expected to cut rates in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, which is believed to play a crucial role in preventing a massive eruption.

          <p>Donald Trump's foreign policy is being shaped by a power struggle between competing factions within his administration. These factions include traditional Republican foreign-policy figures, neo-isolationists, and individuals with close personal ties to the president. Disagreements have emerged over key issues such as Iran, Ukraine, and the Houthis in Yemen. The internal conflicts reflect a broader effort to influence the direction of the MAGA movement and advance competing agendas.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Fuel Companies Face Blame for Trillions in Climate Damage</h2>

          <p>A study from Dartmouth College attributes $28 trillion in climate damage to 111 fossil fuel companies between 1991 and 2020. The research provides a method for tying emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies liable for the costs of extreme weather. Five companies, including Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP, are tied to more than $9 trillion in climate damage. The researchers estimate that every 1% of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused $502 billion in damage from heat alone.</p>
