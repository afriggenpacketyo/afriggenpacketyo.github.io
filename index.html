          <p>Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett is intensifying his demand for the Department of Justice to unseal evidence related to the late Jeffrey Epstein. While advocating for transparency, Burchett emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals who might be mentioned in the files. He acknowledged friction with former President Trump over the issue but noted Trump has since directed the Attorney General to move toward unsealing the evidence. Burchett remains skeptical that the full truth will emerge, citing the secretive nature of Washington, but sees recent actions as a positive start.</p>

          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game warm-ups, players, including sidelined star Caitlin Clark, wore t-shirts with the message "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to highlight ongoing, tense collective bargaining agreement negotiations. The players argue that the league's booming business, evidenced by a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees, justifies increased salaries. Despite the public pressure and contentious talks, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a new, transformational deal will be reached before the current agreement expires on October 31st. The demonstration drew mixed reactions on social media but was praised by the players' association president.</p>

          <h2>Exit Polls Indicate Japan's Ruling Coalition May Lose Upper House Majority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:18:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls from Japan's recent upper house election suggest the ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, is poised to lose its majority, a development that would place his leadership under severe pressure. This potential loss comes amid widespread public frustration over rising inflation, a series of political scandals, and the looming threat of U.S. trade tariffs. If the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner Komeito fail to secure the necessary seats, it would significantly weaken their policymaking influence. Such a result could force Ishiba to resign, potentially destabilizing Japan's government during critical trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Recent scientific research suggests that personality traits, once thought to be fixed, can be intentionally redesigned through conscious effort. The article profiles writer Olga Khazan, who successfully worked to change aspects of her personality, such as high neuroticism and social anxiety, by engaging in activities like improv comedy. According to experts like Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, individuals can alter their characteristic ways of thinking and behaving by consistently adopting new actions, essentially faking it until it becomes natural. This approach offers a new perspective on mental health, suggesting people can actively develop traits that support the life they wish to lead.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies a major red flag in job interviews as a candidate who arrives unprepared and lacks understanding of the company or the role. She emphasizes the importance of due diligence, often asking candidates for specific feedback on the company's current work to gauge their preparation and insight. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by candidates who can provide genuine, constructive feedback on the business. She also values applicants who can openly discuss past mistakes and demonstrate problem-solving skills, which she considers crucial for a fast-paced startup environment.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for flouting a 2021 law by restoring the Confederate names of several U.S. Army bases. Congress, including some Republicans, has moved to block the action, arguing it defies legislation that mandated new names be chosen and implemented. Hegseth's administration has attempted to circumvent the law by claiming the bases are renamed for non-Confederate soldiers who conveniently share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. Critics condemn the move as an insult that honors individuals who fought against the United States to preserve slavery, pointing out the incompetence and white supremacist views of figures like Braxton Bragg.</p>

          <p>This essay explores the complex and often-ignored history of Oklahoma, arguing that its story of land theft, racial violence, and reinvention is central to understanding the United States. The author recounts learning a sanitized version of the state's history, which celebrated pioneers while erasing the forced removal of Indigenous nations and the destruction of Black communities. The piece contrasts the state's historical injustices with its modern efforts to attract new talent through programs like Tulsa Remote. Ultimately, the article suggests that a true understanding of America requires confronting these contradictory legacies of ambition, betrayal, and the ongoing struggle over who belongs.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities and believing non-criminals are being targeted. This shift has contributed to a drop in the president's approval among Hispanic Americans. The poll also indicates that a majority of Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Despite these concerns, Trump's MAGA base remains strongly supportive, particularly regarding his handling of immigration, and shows little concern over the Epstein files controversy.</p>

Once a fringe movement, Sanseito is now projected to win over 10 seats, appealing to voters disaffected with the establishment.

Additionally, goalkeepers are now better prepared, using data analysis to anticipate takers' tendencies, as seen with Sweden's keeper Jennifer Falk, who had notes on her water bottle. The professionalization of the women's game has also led to physically more capable and smarter goalkeeping, making penalties a far less certain source of goals.</p>

          <p>Critics and scientists are warning that the Trump administration's energy policies are setting back environmental progress by decades. In his first six months, the president has used a declared national energy emergency to justify expanding oil, gas, and coal production while gutting green energy initiatives, such as tax credits for wind and solar. These actions, including slashing budgets for climate research at agencies like NOAA, are occurring alongside an increase in climate-related disasters. Scholars argue these moves are not economically sensible but serve to benefit fossil fuel industry allies and undermine the credibility of environmental protection.</p>

The policy gives political appointees the authority to define scientific integrity and decide which evidence is credible, echoing tactics used by the tobacco industry to manufacture doubt. Critics argue this allows officials to sideline inconvenient findings by demanding unattainable levels of certainty or cherry-picking data to fit policy goals. This approach threatens to undermine decades of public health and environmental protections by creating a scientific record designed to justify inaction rather than inform sound policy.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for parts of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, an area that had not previously seen a major ground offensive. The directive has caused widespread panic among the tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians sheltering there, ordering them to move toward the al-Mawasi coastal area. The move could signal an imminent ground attack and has also alarmed the families of Israeli hostages who fear their relatives are being held in the city. This comes as health officials report dozens more killed by Israeli fire near aid distribution points in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A tsunami threat for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been lifted after a series of five powerful earthquakes struck off the coast, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4. The U.S. Geological Survey located the main quake at a depth of 20 kilometers, east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a warning for major waves but later downgraded and then canceled it. A separate tsunami watch for Hawaii was also ended. There have been no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Health agencies are warning of an increased risk of Vibrio bacterial infections in European coastal waters, particularly the Baltic and North Seas, due to climate change. These bacteria, which cause vibriosis, thrive in warmer, low-salinity water, conditions that are becoming more common with rising sea temperatures and marine heatwaves. While infections are relatively rare, they can be serious or even fatal, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems. Officials advise avoiding swimming with open wounds and not eating raw or undercooked shellfish to minimize the risk of infection from these naturally occurring bacteria.</p>

          <p>In response to conservative criticism of the new Superman movie, acclaimed comic book author Grant Morrison highlights the character's progressive origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was depicted as a "champion of the oppressed" and a "socialist figure" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums. Morrison explains that the character's patriotic "American way" persona was a later development during World War II. He argues that Superman has always been an immigrant and a fighter for the downtrodden, a history that contradicts the narrow, nationalistic view some pundits are now promoting.</p>

After gaining control of 10 councils in May, Farage claims his representatives are being "hamstrung" by existing bureaucracies that are resistant to change and unwilling to provide financial transparency. He defended a controversial decision in Warwickshire to hire political assistants, arguing it is necessary to have staff who support the elected councillors' agenda. Opponents, however, have criticized such spending as wasteful and called for the money to be used on front-line services instead.</p>

The author suggests adopting Trump's methods, such as telling a simple, relentless story, appealing to national pride with accessible language, and building a powerful movement outside of traditional party structures. The article posits that opponents should be as undaunted and aggressive in their defense of democracy as Trump has been in his assault on it.

          <p>A wildfire in Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other buildings on the North Rim, leading to devastation and difficult questions. The Dragon Bravo fire, sparked by lightning, was initially allowed to burn under a "control and contain" strategy, but it exploded in size amid a sudden drop in humidity and strong winds. Firefighters on the scene reported being trapped and lacking adequate resources, while critics question the decision not to extinguish the blaze immediately. The loss of the iconic lodge is a devastating blow to park employees and visitors, and the fire poses long-term environmental risks to the park's water source.</p>
