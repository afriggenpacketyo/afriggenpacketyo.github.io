          <p>Linda Yaccarino announced her resignation as CEO of Elon Musk's social media platform X after two years in the role. Her departure follows a period of significant changes to content moderation and safety policies under Musk's ownership, and comes a day after Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, reportedly made antisemitic comments. Yaccarino, previously NBCUniversal's global advertising chief, was tasked with overseeing business operations and placating advertisers, a challenging role given Musk's controversial public statements and the platform's evolution. The article highlights her gratitude to Musk for the opportunity to transform X into an "Everything App."</p>

The move comes as the Canadian semaglutide market is projected to reach $4.03 billion by 2035.

          <p>Major tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia saw significant rallies on Wednesday, with Microsoft hitting an all-time high and Oppenheimer upgrading its rating due to anticipated Azure cloud and AI growth. Nvidia's shares also surged, reflecting its dominant position in AI hardware. In other business news, Starbucks has received interest from nearly 30 firms in China for a potential stake in its Chinese operations, valuing it up to $10 billion. This move aligns with CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround strategy, similar to Yum Brands' spin-off of Yum China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump reportedly told campaign donors last year that he threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. He also claimed similar threats were made to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding Taiwan, aiming to prevent an invasion. These alleged statements, from a May 2024 meeting, highlight Trump's candid and often aggressive rhetoric behind closed doors. The article notes Russia's invasion of Ukraine occurred in 2022 during the Biden administration, and Trump has since publicly criticized Putin for the ongoing conflict.</p>

Emergency crews successfully rescued over 50 individuals, yet the region remains under a flood watch, with forecasts indicating the potential for further downpours.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out extending the freeze on National Insurance and income tax thresholds, currently set to end in April 2028. This freeze, introduced by the Conservatives, has drawn millions into higher tax brackets. While committed to Labour's election pledge not to increase NI, income tax, or VAT, Starmer avoided a specific promise on thresholds, stating no prime minister writes a budget in advance. The opposition warns that a continued freeze could significantly impact lower-income pensioners, potentially raising an estimated £7 billion annually.</p>

          <p>The next Federal Reserve chair, if chosen by President Donald Trump, may face immediate credibility problems due to Trump's increased efforts to politically influence monetary policy. Concerns are rising that a "shadow chair" could be appointed to pressure the Fed into interest rate cuts, potentially undermining its traditional apolitical stance. Experts warn such an arrangement could destabilize financial markets, which rely on the Fed's data-driven independence. This highlights the significant risk of reputational harm to potential nominees and market confusion if the Fed's autonomy is perceived as compromised. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Christian Horner scandal highlights Formula 1's broader issues with its attitude toward women, despite the sport's efforts to attract a growing female fanbase. It details the allegations of misconduct against Horner, Red Bull's internal investigation, and the anonymous leak of alleged WhatsApp messages. The author contends that the focus on team drama rather than workplace concerns signals a failure to protect female employees. The piece emphasizes the need for F1 institutions to address power breaches and improve support for women workers beyond mere "lip service."</p>

          <p>A battle is unfolding in Europe over the future of wolves, as the European Parliament voted to downgrade their protected status, alarming conservationists. This move, driven by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after her pony was killed by a wolf, aims to address concerns from livestock farmers. Environmental groups argue there's no scientific justification for weakening protections, citing minimal attacks on humans and a small percentage of livestock losses. The decision has sparked a heated debate between those advocating for coexistence and farmers seeking greater control over wolf populations.</p>
