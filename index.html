          <p>IonQ is set to acquire Oxford Ionics, a quantum computing startup based in the United Kingdom, in a deal valued at approximately $1.1 billion. The acquisition, primarily in IonQ shares with a small cash component, aims to combine IonQ's expertise in quantum computing hardware and software with Oxford Ionics' semiconductor chip technologies. The merged entity plans to develop quantum computing systems with increasing qubit counts over the next several years, targeting breakthroughs in the field and capitalizing on growing revenue opportunities, as the deal is expected to close later this year. The move comes amid heightened interest in quantum computing following recent chip advancements by major technology companies. </p>

          <p>Maine legislators are considering a bill that would prohibit hotels from providing single-use plastic containers for personal health or beauty products, such as shampoo and other toiletries. The proposed law aims to reduce waste by mandating lodging establishments to use larger, refillable containers instead of small, single-use bottles. The ban would initially apply to hotels with more than 50 rooms in 2030 and expand to smaller establishments by 2032, with non-compliant hotels facing a $100 fine. Several major hotel chains have already begun transitioning to larger, pump-topped bottles to reduce plastic waste, and similar laws are already in effect in New York, California, and Illinois. </p>

          <p>A student loan borrower enrolled in the SAVE Plan forbearance program reported an unexpected accrual of $3,000 in interest, despite assurances of a 0% interest rate. It remains unclear how widespread this issue is, but higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz suggests borrowers check their loan history for balance changes since July 2024. MOHELA, the loan servicer, has acknowledged sending out notices but maintains that borrowers on the SAVE administrative forbearance have interest set at 0%.

          <p>As Republicans push for Donald Trump's tax bill, critics argue that it relies on misconceptions about low-income families and their reliance on safety net programs. Contrary to claims of widespread waste and laziness, research indicates that most recipients of aid who can work are already employed, while others face barriers such as illness, disability, or caregiving responsibilities. The article highlights the story of a family who benefited from expanded government support during the pandemic, enabling them to achieve financial stability, and it emphasizes the need for affordable childcare and other support services to help families achieve economic independence. The article suggests that policies should be based on reality rather than stereotypes. </p>

Key issues on the agenda include Chinese exports of rare earth metals and magnets, essential for manufacturing, and U.S. access to Chinese markets for products like computer chips.

          <p>Over 50 migrants were rescued from an abandoned oil platform in the Mediterranean Sea, where they had been stranded for three days after their boat shipwrecked. The rescue was conducted by the charity ship Astral, operated by Open Arms, and one of the women gave birth on the platform. The migrants were headed to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a common destination for those crossing the Mediterranean, and the Astral later encountered another group of 109 migrants, who were rescued by another charity ship. This incident underscores the ongoing crisis of migrants risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean. </p>
