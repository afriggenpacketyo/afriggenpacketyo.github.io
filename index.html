          <p>A court case has detailed the brutal murders of Albert Alfonso and Paul Longworth by Yostin Mosquera, a man with whom Alfonso had a transactional online relationship based on extreme sex acts. The case revealed that Mosquera traveled from Colombia to the UK at Alfonso's expense before the killings. After murdering both men in their London flat, Mosquera dismembered their bodies and attempted to dispose of them in Bristol, following failed attempts to transfer money from the victims' accounts. Mosquera has since been found guilty of the double murder and awaits sentencing.</p>

          <p>Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, widely known for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54. Officials in Costa Rica confirmed his death was due to an accidental drowning at a beach on the country's Caribbean coast, where he was apparently pulled out to sea by a current. Warner's career spanned decades, including starring roles in "Malcolm & Eddie" and "The Resident," as well as a Grammy-winning music career. Colleagues and friends remembered him as a kind, humble, and supportive individual who was a devoted family man.</p>

          <p>Staff at the historic Ryde Hotel in the California Delta are investigating the mysterious disappearance of most of their resident peacock flock. After a guest reported seeing two men forcing a peacock into a cage, a headcount revealed only four of the several dozen birds remained. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony theft, with the estimated value of the missing birds being thousands of dollars. Hotel staff and law enforcement are concerned the peacocks may have been stolen for the black market exotic animal trade or even for their meat.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Hunter Biden suggested that his father, former President Joe Biden, was taking the sleep aid Ambien around the time of his poor debate performance against Donald Trump. He theorized that exhaustion from extensive international travel combined with the medication could have been a factor, though he later clarified he had no direct knowledge of his father taking it immediately before the debate. Hunter Biden also denied allegations that a bag of cocaine found in the White House in 2023 belonged to him, reaffirming his sobriety since 2019 and criticizing political figures like Matt Gaetz for questioning him.</p>

          <p>Recently released documents from the National Archives reveal that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair purchased over £75,000 worth of clothes for just £31,000, thanks to "wholesale" discounts arranged by her personal shopper. The papers show that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception of these benefits and advised the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts to avoid controversy under a new ministerial code. The Tony Blair Institute has stated that advice was sought and followed at the time.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has surged by 21%, or £221, over the past three years. This sharp increase, driven by high demand and a shortage of available properties, has forced some renters to turn down job opportunities or relocate. While the rate of increase is now slowing, particularly in major cities, more affordable areas are still experiencing significant annual rent hikes. The rising costs are making it increasingly difficult for tenants to save for a home deposit, despite relatively stable house prices. (not investment advice)</p>

McAllister, who was wearing a metal chain, was pulled into the machine and remained stuck for nearly an hour before being freed, suffering several heart attacks that led to his death.

          <p>The investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has been fueled by controversy surrounding the cockpit voice recorder. A preliminary report revealed that seconds after takeoff, both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off," causing a total loss of power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he initiated the cut-off, with the other denying it, creating ambiguity about what occurred. Speculative media reports have led to frustration among investigators and pilots' associations, who urge patience until the final report is released, as the key question of whether it was deliberate action or a system malfunction remains unanswered.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 migrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The program grants temporary protection from deportation and work permits to individuals from countries deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged that the advocacy group CASA has a plausible case against the termination, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. This decision puts thousands of TPS holders at risk of deportation unless they can secure another form of legal status, alarming advocacy groups who argue both countries remain dangerous.</p>

Recent social media posts from Trump have included demands for the Washington Commanders to revert to their old name and commentary on the Bryan Kohberger case. This activity follows a Justice Department announcement that it would not release more Epstein files, a move that angered some of Trump's supporters. Figures like former Rep. Joe Walsh and Rev.

The pressure from U.S. tariffs is reportedly prompting movement toward creating more unified domestic markets and removing these internal obstacles.

The dispute originated from a newsletter where Carlson accused the president of being "complicit" in Israeli military actions, which Trump publicly called "kooky."</p>

          <p>The United States government is taking action to deport lawful permanent residents who are alleged to have provided support to violent gangs in Haiti. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move targets individuals linked to Viv Ansanm, a powerful gang alliance that the Trump administration designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This policy follows the arrest of prominent Haitian businessman and former presidential hopeful Pierre Reginald Boulos in Miami. The move is part of an effort to prevent individuals from using their legal status in the U.S. while facilitating criminal activities in Haiti, which has been wracked by escalating gang violence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of FBI records related to the surveillance and assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from his family. In a statement, King's children urged the public to view the files within the context of the FBI's historical campaign to discredit their father and the Civil Rights Movement. They reiterated their belief that Dr. King was killed as part of a wider conspiracy and condemned any attempts to weaponize the documents to spread falsehoods. The release follows a Trump executive order to declassify records related to major assassinations of the 1960s.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—that he believes are poised for continued momentum, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these companies, which he dubbed "PARC," represent a separate track in the market where enthusiasm from individual buyers is a primary driver of value. While acknowledging their recent pullback, Cramer suggested these names are likely to rebound due to their solid earnings and analyst attention. He advised investors to be disciplined and take profits when they see significant gains in these more speculative names. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and raising the possibility of an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, driven by factors like the planet's liquid core and atmospheric changes, has led to the shortest days recorded since the advent of atomic clocks. If this trend continues, timekeepers may need to introduce a "negative leap second" to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it aligned with Earth's rotation. This has never been done before and raises concerns about potential disruptions to computer systems, satellites, and telecommunications networks that rely on precise time standards.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article from the BBC explores how the Trump administration is leveraging the judicial system and a high volume of executive orders to advance its agenda, potentially reshaping the balance of power in the U.S. government. Recent Supreme Court rulings favorable to the administration have emboldened its approach, leading to direct confrontations with lower court judges who have attempted to block its policies. Critics, including former judges, describe the administration's rhetoric against the judiciary as an unprecedented attack. This strategy of bypassing a preoccupied Congress with executive actions has led to numerous legal challenges, setting the stage for a prolonged battle over presidential authority.</p>
