            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device, producing a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds without nuclear materials.

            <p>The death toll in attacks in Nigeria's central Benue state has risen to 56, with the possibility of further increases as the search continues. Governor Hyacinth Alia attributed the attacks to "suspected herdsmen." These incidents are part of a larger pattern of intercommunal violence in the Middle Belt, often involving clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to stem the violence. Optimism Score: 20</p>
