            <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, met with Rev. Al Sharpton following criticism and calls for a boycott after the retailer scaled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Sharpton expressed concerns about Target's commitment to the Black community and its investment in Black-owned businesses. Foot traffic at Target stores has declined since the DEI rollback, prompting Sharpton to consult with his organization's board to determine further actions. The meeting was described as "constructive and candid," and Sharpton will consult with allies before deciding on potential boycotts.</p>

            <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is facing a criminal referral for alleged mortgage fraud, which a real estate expert suggests is retaliation for her pursuit of Donald Trump in court. The referral stems from a 2023 home purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, where James allegedly misidentified the property as her primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms. While the expert notes this type of fraud is common, it raises questions about ethical standards for elected officials. James' office has defended her actions, citing the judge's rejection of arguments that her case against Trump was politically motivated.</p>

            <p>The IRS is evaluating whether to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status after a request from Treasury Department officials and public criticism from President Trump. Trump has suggested Harvard should be taxed as a political entity, arguing that tax-exempt status is a privilege contingent on acting in the public interest. The White House stated that any IRS actions would be independent of the president. Harvard maintains there is no legal basis to rescind its tax-exempt status, which saves the university an estimated $500 million annually.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s comments about autism have drawn criticism from parents and experts, who say his remarks reinforce harmful stereotypes. Kennedy claimed that autism "destroys families" and that affected children will "never" achieve certain milestones.
