          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, where over two million people gathered. The suspects, who identified as Lady Gaga fans, were arrested for spreading hate speech and radicalizing teenagers online, including promoting self-harm. Authorities seized electronic devices and materials in multiple states, following a tip about online groups encouraging violence using coded language. The concert, funded by the city to revitalize Rio's economy, featured heavy security with 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras. Lady Gaga performed Brazil-themed acts, expressing her gratitude to the emotional crowd after a decade since her last performance in the country.</p>

He is hoping to join Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as the only qualifiers to land snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to South Yorkshire.

The firings have disrupted government functions and services, raising alarms about the loss of scientific and technical expertise. A destabilized civil service was central to the vision laid out by Russell Vought, head of the office of management and budget and chief architect of Project 2025, who once said: “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.”</p>

          <p>Clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs are reporting that the president’s return-to-office order is causing issues with patient privacy. The order is forcing many of them to work from makeshift spaces where sensitive conversations can be overheard.

          <p>Survivors of grooming gangs have criticized Labour minister Lucy Powell for calling the scandal a “dog whistle” issue. Sarah Wilson, a survivor of sexual abuse, said the comment dismissed the experiences of abuse survivors. The issue has returned to public prominence in January amid hundreds of posts on the subject by Elon Musk, the owner of X and a close ally of Donald Trump. Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, said his Cabinet colleague will continue in her role and that she felt “mortified”.</p>

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as particularly damaging to relationships. This phrase, whether directed at an ex, a friend's partner, or even a past version of the current partner, communicates inadequacy and can lead to insecurity. The psychologist notes that the phrase is often a symptom of a deeper issue: a fear of openly communicating needs. Research suggests that partners who feel uncertain or insecure in their relationship are more likely to use such comparisons rather than directly expressing their frustrations.</p>
