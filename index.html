          <p>The Department of Justice placed an attorney on leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a Maryland migrant case, where an individual was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the need for DOJ attorneys to "zealously advocate" for the administration's interests, leading to consequences for those who fail to do so. A supervisor was also placed on leave for failure to supervise. The government is appealing the judge's order to facilitate the return of the deported man, raising concerns about the administration's handling of immigration cases.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports is causing global concern and debate about the future of free trade. Critics argue that these tariffs, designed to bring jobs back to the US, mark a departure from globalization and could lead to a trade war. The White House justifies the tariffs as a way to correct trade imbalances, but economists warn they could raise inflation and harm American consumers. The BBC analyzes the potential consequences of Trump's protectionist policies, including the impact on US companies and international relations.</p>

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, labeling the move "unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning". Israeli media reported that the MPs were barred due to intentions to spread "hateful rhetoric" against Israel. Lammy stated that the foreign office is providing support to the affected MPs and has communicated the UK's concerns to the Israeli government. This incident raises questions about diplomatic relations and freedom of movement for parliamentarians.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing the judge lacked the authority to compel such action. Government lawyers claim it's constitutionally intolerable to force the Executive branch to engage with a foreign power in this way. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was deported despite a prior ruling protecting him from deportation due to potential persecution. His attorney argues the government has taken no real steps to rectify their error.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student activist facing deportation, accused the university of suppressing student dissent over Israel's war in Gaza. Khalil, a green-card holder, is being targeted under a provision in federal immigration law for allegedly posing a threat to US foreign policy. He claimed Columbia's leadership created a climate of fear by equating anti-Israel sentiment with antisemitism. Khalil urged students to continue protesting and reclaim the university.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave after he struggled to defend the Trump administration's actions in court. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, was representing the government in a lawsuit concerning a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Reuveni was reportedly placed on leave for failing to "zealously advocate" for the government's interests. The case highlights the administration's controversial immigration policies and the pressure on government lawyers to defend them.</p>
