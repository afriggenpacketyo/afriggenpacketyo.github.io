            <p>President Trump underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed, his first of his second term. While details are limited, the White House promised an update on his health, referencing the need for transparency. Trump's last comprehensive exam was in 2023, revealing "excellent" overall health, though specifics were limited. His prior health history includes high cholesterol, rosacea, and a COVID-19 hospitalization in 2020. Optimism around the health of a public figure is still generally stable, so this does not reduce the optimism score.</p>

Some cancellations were later reversed, but aid to Afghanistan and Yemen has been eliminated, raising concerns about the impact on vulnerable populations.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, citing a Cold War-era immigration law and declaring his presence adverse to American foreign policy interests. Khalil, a permanent legal resident, was detained for his role in pro-Palestinian protests. The ACLU criticized the decision, calling it "pre-written" and alleging it targets Khalil for his speech. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, and he also has a federal court lawsuit challenging his arrest.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved significant trash fee increases for residents to address a budget deficit. Fees for single-family homes and smaller apartment buildings will more than double, rising annually through 2029. The council argues the city has subsidized trash pickup for too long. Residents can protest the fees, but landlords are likely to pass the costs on to tenants. Concerns were raised about the regressive nature of the fee and its impact on low-income residents.</p>

The author also highlights the rise of Buy Nothing groups on Facebook, which prioritize gifting and mutual aid over commerce.</p>

Some companies are using the situation as a promotional tool, offering "pre-tariff sales" to boost sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The project aims to reduce wildfire risk and the need for emergency power shutdowns. The plan, costing at least $860 million, targets areas at higher risk of wildfires. Governor Newsom's suspension of environmental laws facilitated the plan, which is expected to take years to complete.</p>

Critics warn the cuts would undermine NOAA's ability to provide life-saving weather research and services.

The move comes as the appetite for executions nationwide has declined, and New York State abolished the death penalty in 2007.</p>
