        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is engaged in a renewed debate regarding the potential ban of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, following its classification as a "confirmed right-wing extremist" organization by the country's domestic intelligence agency. This classification has already led to political repercussions, including barring AfD politicians from accompanying government officials on international trips. The AfD has filed a lawsuit against the intelligence agency, claiming the classification is unlawful and an attempt to criminalize criticism of immigration policy. The security authority's report is largely based on court rulings by the independent judiciary, which have provided extensive evidence of just how radical the AfD is.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the constitutional and legal requirements for 'due process' for non-citizens facing deportation under the Trump administration. While the Constitution guarantees due process to all individuals on U.S. soil, the specifics of what that entails for migrants are contested. Legal experts explain that due process does not necessarily mean a trial for every migrant, but requires the government to take steps to ensure fairness and the safety of vulnerable individuals. The article outlines various legal precedents and ongoing legal challenges, highlighting the complexities of balancing immigration enforcement with constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at easing exports for UK firms and reducing taxes on Indian goods. The deal, which does not alter immigration policies, is projected to increase trade between the two countries by an additional £25.5 billion annually by 2040. Key benefits include halved tariffs on gin and whisky, reduced levies on cars and food products, and a three-year exemption on social security for Indian employees working in the UK. The agreement is considered the UK's most significant bilateral trade deal since leaving the European Union.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a decline despite reporting earnings that aligned with expectations and increasing its full-year revenue guidance. The company's commercial revenues saw substantial growth, driven by increased adoption of its artificial intelligence software. However, analysts expressed concerns regarding the modest increase in full-year revenue guidance, a sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decrease in international commercial revenue. Despite CEO Alex Karp's optimistic outlook, the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable to compression as revenue growth slows.</p>

It also details how American white supremacist groups are expanding their influence internationally through online grooming and real-world interactions, often with deadly consequences, and how prominent political figures are enabling the growth of far-right groups.</p>

          <p>Experts and advocacy groups are warning that Americans' health is at risk following the Trump administration's announcement of budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), reducing staffing to levels not seen since the 1980s and significantly diminishing its scientific research arm. The EPA's administrator stated that the budget would be slashed by $300 million in the fiscal year 2026, which will cut the 1,500 staff at the office of research and development (ORD). The Union of Concerned Scientists said that shuttering the EPA’s scientific arm that conducts independent research and folding it into policy offices will turn the EPA into a purely political agency.</p>

          <p>This article examines the historical roots of right-wing animosity toward American universities, arguing that it stems from a century-long backlash against the democratization of admissions and the diversification of curriculum. It traces the evolution of conservative attacks on higher education, from the early 20th century when European immigrant students began to enroll, to the McCarthy era purges, to the culture wars of the 1980s and 90s, and culminating in the current MAGA movement's assault on campuses. The author contends that these attacks aim to delegitimize the academy and defund public higher education, returning colleges to an exclusive space for class reproduction.</p>

          <p>Recent trade data indicates that President Trump's tariffs have triggered a broad decline in U.S. exports, impacting the agricultural sector most severely. Ports are experiencing a significant drop in export container bookings, with the Port of Portland, Oregon, seeing a 51% decrease. The farming sector has been warning of a "crisis" and ports data is showing more evidence of lack of ability to move product out to global markets. The slide in exports is linked to the decline in containerships coming to the U.S., as businesses across the economy cancel manufacturing orders, sending Chinese factories and freight ships into retreat, as well as changes in global demand linked to U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>The Haenyeo, women divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, may have developed unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep diving. Research indicates they possess lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance, potentially leading to future medical treatments. Genomic analysis revealed at least three distinctive traits: bradycardia, a slow heart rate, and genetic mutations associated with cold tolerance and decreased diastolic blood pressure. These adaptations may protect pregnant women while diving, resisting the rise in blood pressure typically associated with breath-holding.</p>

          <p>This article examines how numerous musicians and artists favored by the Nazi regime managed to maintain successful careers following World War II. Despite their association with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party, figures like conductor Herbert von Karajan and architect Albert Speer were able to resume their work or even thrive in postwar Germany. The denazification process led by the Allies aimed to remove those with close ties to Hitler from positions of power, but many artists on Hitler's list of "divinely gifted" individuals continued to receive commissions and recognition.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have established a bilateral trade agreement aimed at reducing tariffs on key exports, including U.K. whisky and cars. This agreement comes amidst rising global trade tensions instigated by the United States. India will gradually lower taxes on imports from the U.K., with the majority of traded goods becoming fully tariff-free within a decade. The agreement aims to bolster economic ties between the two nations at a time when global trade relationships are being strained by U.S. trade policies.</p>

          <p>Rebekah Vardy has been ordered to pay over £1.4 million of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their high-profile libel battle, dubbed the "Wagatha Christie" trial. This amount includes an initial payment of £1.19m, an additional £212,266, and further assessment costs. The judge expressed hope that this ruling would mark the end of a long and unhappy road for both parties, urging them to put the matter behind them. The case stemmed from Rooney's accusation that Vardy had leaked her private information to the press.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are considering ending Medicaid provider taxes as a means to achieve steep federal spending reductions. These taxes, used by states to increase federal matching funds, could save the federal government approximately $600 billion over the next decade. However, this change could disproportionately affect Republican-led states, as their Medicaid budgets often rely heavily on the provider tax strategy. If the taxes are eliminated, states may need to cut Medicaid coverage, reduce payments to hospitals, or raise taxes to compensate for the lost federal funding.</p>

          <p>This article compares President Trump's second term to Vladimir Putin's ascent to power in Russia, noting that while Trump has adopted similar autocratic tactics, he has overlooked the crucial element of economic stability that underpinned Putin's success. While Trump focuses on cultural grievances and partisan support, Putin prioritized economic competence and delegated monetary policy to technocrats, leading to significant improvements in Russia's GDP. The article argues that Trump's failure to prioritize economic stability could undermine his regime, as economic hardship limits the power of propaganda and cultural affinity.</p>
