          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 14:21:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold steady its benchmark interest rate, remaining within the 4.25%-4.5% range, as policymakers evaluate the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy. The decision reflects concerns about rising economic risks, including the potential for stagflationâ€”a combination of higher unemployment and inflationâ€”due to tariffs. While acknowledging a solid labor market, the Fed noted increased uncertainty about the economic outlook and remains attentive to both sides of its dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. Market expectations anticipate potential rate cuts later in the year, contingent on economic developments.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India initiated "Operation Sindoor," conducting strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India claims the strikes targeted terrorist infrastructure, while Pakistan denounces them as unprovoked acts of aggression, leading to casualties on both sides. Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors have escalated, with conflicting reports emerging regarding the extent of the damage and the nature of the targets. The strikes follow weeks of rising tension after the attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, and have raised concerns about further escalation in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the United States, grappling with significant debt and escalating competition from weight-loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The bankruptcy process aims to restructure the company's debt by writing off $1.15 billion while negotiating new repayment terms with lenders. Despite the filing, WeightWatchers assures its members that it will continue operating without disruption during the restructuring. The company attributes its financial difficulties to the rapidly evolving landscape of weight management, particularly the increasing demand for pharmaceutical weight loss solutions.</p>

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving office, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. criticized President Trumpâ€™s handling of foreign policy, particularly his approach to the war in Ukraine and dealings with global allies. Biden expressed dismay at Trump's combative meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his suggestions to rename the Gulf of Mexico and acquire Greenland. He defended his own decision to seek re-election, despite internal party concerns, and highlighted his administration's successes. Biden's re-emergence into the public sphere signals his intent to shape his legacy and remain a voice within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services granted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) an exemption to hire a new class of Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers, averting a potential halving of the fellowship program. These "disease detectives" are crucial for investigating outbreaks and responding to health emergencies. The program's continuation was uncertain due to a federal hiring freeze, but the exemption allows the CDC to onboard and train new EIS officers. This decision underscores the importance of these officers in maintaining public health infrastructure and responding to emerging threats.</p>

          <p>A new study by the Pew Institute reveals a decline in American adults' belief in the impact of Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests since 2020. While initial support for the movement was high following George Floyd's death, it has since decreased, with fewer Americans believing that increased attention to race and racial inequality has led to positive changes for Black people. The study also highlights partisan divides in views on racial issues and the impact of President Trump on equal rights.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, prospective home equity borrowers have time to analyze their options between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While historically a home equity loan was preferable during rate pauses due to its fixed rate, the current climate suggests a HELOC may be better due to the likelihood of future rate cuts. HELOCs currently offer lower average interest rates than home equity loans, providing potential savings for borrowers who can manage variable payments. Borrowers should carefully compare both options to ensure affordability.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady has sparked questions about the future of mortgage rates. While the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, its policies influence the broader interest rate environment. The rate pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, especially if investors anticipate future rate cuts. However, mortgage rates also depend on inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty. Prospective homebuyers should improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and explore different loan types to secure the lowest possible mortgage rates.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that humans have directly visualized less than 0.001% of the Earth's deep seafloor. Exploratory expeditions are concentrated near the United States, Japan, and New Zealand, leaving vast areas, like the Indian Ocean, largely unexplored. The limited exploration hinders a comprehensive understanding of deep-sea ecosystems and their unique life forms. Researchers advocate for developing low-cost technologies to expand ocean exploration and promote global participation in uncovering the mysteries of the deep sea.</p>

Hamas accused Israel of using starvation and threats to force negotiations, while Gazan civilians expressed despair and fear of further displacement amid a dire humanitarian situation and a blockade on aid supplies.</p>

          <p>After a six-month legal battle, Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin conceded the North Carolina Supreme Court seat to Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs.

Two recounts had confirmed Riggs' win by a narrow margin. The case tested the boundaries of post-election litigation and raised concerns about setting a dangerous precedent for future election challenges.</p>
