          <p>Waymo and Toyota have announced a partnership to explore integrating Waymo's autonomous technology into personally-owned vehicles, aiming to accelerate the development of driver assistance and self-driving capabilities. Waymo's co-CEO suggests this collaboration could also lead to Toyota vehicles being incorporated into Waymo's ride-hailing fleet. This partnership follows Waymo's previous collaborations with other automakers, and it will not affect Waymo's plans to deploy Hyundai and Geely vehicles in its Waymo One service. Alphabet's CEO has hinted at the possibility of personal ownership of Waymo-equipped vehicles, aligning with GM's shift toward autonomous systems for personal use after abandoning its robotaxi business.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has unanimously approved a $4 billion settlement for victims of sexual assault in county-run juvenile facilities and foster homes, marking the largest settlement of its kind in U.S. history. This settlement addresses nearly 7,000 claims, primarily involving alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, highlighting systemic failures in screening for abusers and protecting vulnerable children. The county plans to finance the settlement through bonds and its rainy day fund, impacting community investments for decades. Supervisors are also considering measures to improve accountability and prevent future abuse, including stricter vetting processes and tying department heads' salaries to abuse prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>Mike Peters, the lead singer of the Welsh rock group The Alarm, has passed away at the age of 66 after a long and public battle with cancer. The Alarm, formed in 1981, gained international recognition with hits like “The Stand” and “Sixty Eight Guns,” becoming a popular opening act for stadium rock bands. Peters was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1995 and later with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, using his experiences to co-found the Love Hope Strength Foundation, which recruited bone marrow donors at concerts. His contributions to cancer activism led to him being appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2019.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, has faced both support and criticism for his efforts to cut government spending and reduce the federal workforce. Musk promised significant cost savings but has so far achieved less than initially predicted, with many of DOGE's claims about spending cuts being called into question. The administration's efforts to slash the federal workforce have also faced legal challenges and concerns about potential disruptions to critical government services. Despite the controversies, Musk remains influential in the administration, spearheading efforts to streamline government operations and eliminate what he deems as bureaucratic inefficiencies.</p>

          <p>A Texas jury has found Caysen Allison not guilty of murder but guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 stabbing death of Joe Ramirez Jr. at Belton High School. The case stemmed from a fight in the school's restroom, where Allison claimed self-defense after being attacked by Ramirez. Evidence presented included text messages where Allison asked for a gun and witness testimony describing a heated argument prior to the incident. Allison's defense argued he acted in self-defense, while the prosecution highlighted threats he made against Ramirez before the stabbing. Allison faces up to two years in state prison at his sentencing hearing.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has temporarily suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan following her arrest by the FBI on charges of obstructing a federal proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest.

          <p>Two dozen states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over dramatic cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the administration is trying to "dismantle" the volunteer service organization. The lawsuit argues the cuts violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers, since Congress created and funded AmeriCorps. The Trump administration claims AmeriCorps has failed audits and made improper payments. The lawsuit argues that the cuts will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large.</p>

The judge found that the Border Patrol engaged in a "pattern and practice" of violating constitutional rights by detaining people without reasonable suspicion.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won the Canadian federal election but will form a minority government, requiring them to negotiate with other parties to pass legislation. Carney, a relative newcomer to politics, vowed to stand up to the US in his victory speech. The Liberals are projected to fall short of a majority in the House of Commons, necessitating deals with parties like the Bloc Québécois and the NDP. Carney has pledged to focus on securing Canada's economy in the face of US tariff headwinds, potentially including a tax cut for lower- and middle-class Canadians.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a Venezuelan mother to Venezuela and the father to a prison in El Salvador, leaving their 2-year-old daughter in foster care in the United States.

          <p>President Trump has once again publicly criticized the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Speaking at a rally in Michigan, Trump stated that Powell is "not really doing a good job," despite saying he wants to be respectful to the Fed. Trump's attacks on Powell have intensified after the Fed chair suggested that Trump's tariffs would lead to higher inflation and slower growth. Trump has previously called for "pre-emptive rate cuts" and referred to Powell as a "major loser."</p>

The Trump administration had terminated the grant and then withheld the money, asserting it was negotiating new terms, but the judge deemed these actions as delay tactics.

The changes aim to help automakers with a "little transition," but the 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains.

          <p>A new study reveals that human wounds heal significantly slower than those of other mammals, including chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice. This slower healing rate may be an evolutionary trade-off resulting from humans' loss of fur in favor of sweat glands, which are essential for cooling. Hair follicles, abundant in furry animals, house stem cells that efficiently repair skin wounds, while sweat glands are less effective. The evolutionary shift toward sweat glands allowed humans to engage in physical activity in hot environments and facilitated brain cooling, potentially outweighing the disadvantage of slower wound healing.</p>
