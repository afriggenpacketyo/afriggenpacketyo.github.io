          <p>U.S. President Trump announced "great progress" in Ukraine peace negotiations following a meeting between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The Kremlin described the talks as "constructive," with both sides exchanging signals about potential strategic cooperation. This development comes just before a Trump-imposed deadline for a ceasefire, with the White House stating Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky. Despite the positive tone, expectations for a swift resolution remain low as Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India for its continued purchase of Russian oil, raising the total tariff to 50%. This measure is part of a broader strategy to pressure countries supporting Russia's economy amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. India's foreign ministry labeled the tariff "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," highlighting that the US had previously encouraged such imports to stabilize global energy markets. The move signals a tougher stance on secondary sanctions, potentially impacting other nations trading with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose a tariff of approximately 100% on imported semiconductors to incentivize domestic manufacturing. The announcement was made during an event with Apple CEO Tim Cook, where the tech company pledged a new $100 billion investment in U.S.-based production. According to the president, the steep tariff would not apply to companies that commit to building and manufacturing microchips within the United States. This policy aims to reshore critical technology supply chains and bolster the American manufacturing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The canceled projects, primarily focused on COVID-19 and flu vaccines, included proposals from major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that HHS determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from infectious disease experts and former Surgeon General Jerome Adams. Critics argue the decision undermines pandemic preparedness and disregards the life-saving success of mRNA technology.</p>

          <p>A UK charity regulator has cleared Prince Harry of bullying allegations related to Sentebale, the African charity he co-founded. The investigation found no evidence of systemic bullying or misconduct by the Duke of Sussex, though it criticized all parties for allowing the internal dispute to become public. In a strongly worded statement, a spokesperson for Harry noted the findings but expressed disappointment that the charity's chair, who made the initial claims, would not face consequences for the damage caused. The dispute led to Harry and his co-founder resigning from their patron roles in March.</p>

Since China controls most of the world's refining capacity and supplied 70% of U.S. imports from 2020-2023, these restrictions could significantly impact American industries.

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's repeated attempts to divert media attention away from his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are having the opposite effect. The president has employed tactics such as denouncing the story as a "hoax," creating other news through sudden policy announcements, and having allies release limited information. However, these strategies often backfire, raising more questions and fueling further interest in the topic. Recent developments, including a subpoena for Justice Department records and confusion over a high-level meeting, continue to keep the Epstein story in the headlines.</p>

Total orders and gross order value also saw substantial growth, reflecting continued strong demand for its services.

          <p>Human remains discovered inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fish Lake, Utah, have been identified as belonging to a man who went missing 28 years ago. Officials used the manufacturing date of the boot to link the discovery to the 1997 disappearance of David White. White had gone fishing alone, and his boat was later found empty. DNA testing confirmed the remains were his with over 99.9% certainty, finally providing a degree of closure for his family and the original search and rescue teams involved in the decades-old cold case.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the mall-based retailer known for teen accessories and ear piercing, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time since 2018. The company cited pressure from online competitors, shifting consumer spending habits, and its debt load as reasons for the filing. While its North American stores are expected to remain open during the process, the move reflects the broader decline of traditional mall-based retail. The chain has struggled to compete with low-cost e-commerce sites and adapt to a new generation of shoppers who follow online trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House's apparent decision to block a transit stop in New York for Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te has drawn criticism from Democrats but has been met with unusual silence from Republicans. This muted response is a departure from the GOP's typically vocal support for high-level engagement with Taiwan. Three prominent House Democrats sent a letter to the Secretary of State expressing "grave concern" that denying the stopover deviates from precedent and sends a dangerous signal to Beijing. Observers speculate the Republican reticence may be linked to ongoing, high-stakes trade negotiations with China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Republicans aggressively pursue mid-decade redistricting in states like Texas, Democrats find their ability to retaliate is constrained by their own past reforms. For years, Democrats championed independent, nonpartisan commissions to draw legislative maps, a good-government stance that has cost them control over the process in key blue states like California and New York. Now facing a potential lock-out from a U.S. House majority, some Democrats are reassessing this position, but unwinding these voter-approved commissions is a slow and difficult process. This imbalance highlights a strategic disadvantage for the party in the escalating gerrymandering wars.</p>

          <p>A conflict has emerged within the bipartisan commission organizing America's 250th anniversary celebrations, known as America250, following an attempt by a Trump-appointed executive to oust four Republican commissioners. The move, reportedly an effort to install new appointees more loyal to the president, backfired when the commissioners refused to resign and other members began discussing the executive's removal. This turmoil comes as the White House seeks greater control over the nation's cultural institutions and plans a series of politically-tinged anniversary events, raising concerns about the politicization of the national celebration.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that fraudulent scientific research is being produced and published at an industrial scale, often through collusion between unethical authors and journal editors. Researchers found that organized groups, dubbed "paper mills," are selling fabricated articles to academics who need publications for career advancement, particularly in countries with policy-driven publication quotas. By analyzing retracted articles and editorial patterns, the study identified clusters of editors who handled a disproportionate number of problematic papers. This flood of fake literature threatens to pollute entire fields of research and undermine trust in the scientific process.</p>

After their mother traveled to India for formal identification, the returned casket was found to contain the remains of two different people, neither of whom was her son.

          <p>The runway at Birmingham Airport in the UK was closed for over six hours after a small aircraft experienced landing gear failure and made an emergency landing. The plane, a Beechcraft fixed-wing aircraft, had two crew members and one passenger on board, none of whom were seriously injured. The prolonged closure caused significant disruption, leading to numerous flight cancellations and diversions, affecting thousands of travelers. The runway was reopened in the evening after the disabled aircraft was safely removed, though delays continued for some time.</p>
