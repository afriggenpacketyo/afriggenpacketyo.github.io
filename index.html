          <p>Scientists have successfully helped Yosemite's native turtles recover by removing invasive bullfrogs from remote ponds. The American bullfrog, which preys on various species including turtle hatchlings, had decimated the Northwestern pond turtle population. By eradicating approximately 16,000 bullfrogs, researchers observed a resurgence in the turtle population, as well as other native species. This study highlights the potential for targeted invasive species removal to restore freshwater ecosystems, though it requires constant vigilance to prevent reinvasion.</p>

          <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill are considering legislation that would cut billions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially impacting millions of Americans. A KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans, suggesting potential backlash from their own constituents. The proposed cuts are part of a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, which, if enacted, could cause 15 million people to lose their health insurance. This situation highlights the complex political dynamics surrounding healthcare policy and its impact on various demographics. (not investment advice)</p>
