        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency after data revealed its infant mortality rate has reached a decade-high of 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average. The primary causes include congenital malformations, premature birth, and SIDS, with Black infants being disproportionately affected. State officials plan to expand prenatal services and strengthen community health programs, though experts emphasize that addressing structural inequities like poverty and healthcare access is crucial for lasting improvement. The crisis is further complicated by federal funding cuts to key maternal and infant health data collection programs.</p>

The analysis suggests a bullish outlook for sectors like housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, highlighting specific stocks such as Toll Brothers and Goldman Sachs as bellwethers. It also identifies potential pain points in healthcare and enterprise software, which may be vulnerable to AI disruption.

          <p>The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, recently appeared with a new, lighter blonde hairstyle, prompting speculation about its significance beyond a simple style change. A British psychologist suggests the change could reflect a desire to feel more energetic and embrace a fresh start following her cancer treatment. The expert noted that if the princess experienced hair loss, coloring it blonde might be a way of reclaiming visibility and drawing positive attention to its regrowth. This change is the latest in a gradual lightening of her hair color over the past year, coinciding with her return to public life.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has authorized a small number of National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., to carry their service weapons, a notable escalation in their deployment. This decision reverses previous guidance that troops would be unarmed while patrolling the city as part of a federal law enforcement initiative. The Joint Task Force stated that force would only be used as a last resort against an imminent threat of serious harm. While the troops' role has largely been non-confrontational, such as protecting landmarks, the move has raised concerns among local officials who question the necessity of the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>The French foreign ministry has summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner following a letter he sent to President Emmanuel Macron, which alleged that France is not doing enough to combat rising antisemitism. The ministry firmly rejected the claims, calling them "unacceptable" and contrary to international law regarding non-interference in domestic affairs. This diplomatic incident adds to existing tensions between the two allies over issues such as trade tariffs and the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. The contents of Kushner's letter were not publicly released, but the summons represents a formal expression of displeasure from the French government.</p>

          <p>Evergrande, once China's largest property developer, has been officially delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a significant milestone in its collapse. The company, which is saddled with over $300 billion in debt, was ordered into liquidation in January after failing to present a viable restructuring plan. This event symbolizes the deep crisis within China's property sector, which has been a major drag on the nation's economy, suppressing consumer spending and impacting household wealth. Experts believe the delisting is final and that more property firms may fail, despite Beijing's efforts to stabilize the market without direct bailouts.</p>

He transitioned to acting after a friend, a casting director, suggested he audition for a film role. This led to a successful late-in-life career that spanned over 30 years in film and television, proving a fulfilling alternative to retirement.</p>

Analysts argue that Russia tailors its content to specific audiences, blending accurate news with disinformation to build legitimacy and promote its geopolitical narratives, such as justifying the war in Ukraine.

          <p>Evidence seized from a suspected Saudi intelligence operative shortly after the 9/11 attacks, including a video of him conducting surveillance of the U.S. Capitol in 1999, was reportedly never shared with lead FBI field agents or senior intelligence officials. The video, made by Omar al-Bayoumi, who had close ties to two of the hijackers, has surfaced as part of a lawsuit by 9/11 families against Saudi Arabia. Retired FBI agents who led the original investigation expressed anger, stating the evidence would have been critical to their work. This revelation raises questions about why potentially crucial intelligence was not disseminated during the investigation into the attacks.</p>

          <p>Defense technology company Anduril has unveiled its unmanned fighter jet, named "Fury," a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) designed to fly alongside and protect manned aircraft. The jet operates autonomously using artificial intelligence, with no cockpit or onboard pilot controls. Anduril's CEO, Brian Schimpf, explains that Fury is intended to fly ahead of manned jets, detecting and engaging enemies first to shield human pilots from harm. The company, which won a contract to develop the aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, aims to make it easier to mass-produce by using more readily available commercial components, representing a new approach to military aviation.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify a potential deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, a move local leaders oppose. The Pentagon has confirmed that planning is underway for such an operation, which follows similar deployments in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, called the proposal a "flagrant violation of our constitution," while Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stated he has not requested federal assistance. Critics argue the president is using the military for political purposes, targeting Democratic-run cities over claims of high crime, despite data showing declines in violence.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), according to a senior defense official. No reason was provided for the sudden dismissal, which reportedly caught DIA employees and congressional intelligence leaders by surprise. The move follows the removal of two other senior military officials and has drawn criticism from lawmakers. Speculation connects the firing to a recent DIA assessment on Iran's nuclear program that contradicted President Trump's more optimistic public statements, fueling concerns within the agency about the politicization of intelligence.</p>

          <p>A townhouse resident received a warning from their Homeowners Association (HOA) for charging a visiting family member's Tesla in their driveway. The HOA's letter claimed that electrical cords running along the ground for vehicle charging were not permitted, citing aesthetic concerns rather than safety violations. The homeowner was using the standard Level 1 charging cable provided with the vehicle, plugged directly into a garage outlet. This incident sparked a debate online, with many commenters suggesting the HOA was overstepping its authority, as the practice does not violate the National Electrical Code and appears to be based on subjective rules about appearance.</p>

          <p>The first human case of the New World screwworm in the United States has been confirmed in a person in Maryland who had recently traveled from Guatemala. Screwworms are parasitic flies whose larvae burrow into and consume the living flesh of warm-blooded animals, including humans, and can be fatal if untreated. The case raises significant concerns for the U.S. livestock industry, as an outbreak could be devastating to cattle populations and cost billions. This detection comes as U.S. and Mexican authorities are already working to combat the northward spread of the parasite from Central America.</p>
