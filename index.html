          <p>Demonstrations have taken place in multiple UK cities, including London, Liverpool, and Bristol, concerning the government's policy of housing asylum seekers in hotels. Police were deployed to separate protesters from anti-racism counter-demonstrators, with no reports of serious trouble. The protests follow a recent High Court ruling that blocked one hotel in Essex from being used for this purpose, prompting other local authorities to consider similar legal challenges. The demonstrations highlight growing tensions around immigration policy and local community safety concerns.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lieutenant General Jeffery Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), along with two other senior commanders. The dismissal comes weeks after the White House strongly refuted a leaked DIA report which concluded that American strikes had only minorly delayed Iran's nuclear program. President Trump had publicly declared the agency's assessment "flat out wrong" and accused the media of demeaning a successful military operation. Critics, including Senator Mark Warner, have warned that the firing suggests a pattern of treating intelligence as a loyalty test.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that the country's extensive social welfare state is no longer financially sustainable based on current economic output, calling for significant reforms. Speaking at a party conference, Merz ruled out any tax increases for medium-sized companies, a position that creates potential conflict with his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners. While the SPD has acknowledged the need for reform, its leaders have emphasized creative solutions over simple benefit cuts, setting the stage for contentious budget negotiations.</p>

Strong performances from Maia Bouchier and Laura Wolvaardt led the team to successfully chase a target of 126 runs with six balls remaining. This marks a significant turnaround for the Southampton-based side, which finished last in the previous season after winning the tournament in 2023. They will now await the winner of the Eliminator match for the final at Lord's.</p>

          <p>Despite not being the newest or most powerful in China's arsenal, the DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a vital component of the country's nuclear deterrent. A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated the missile's capability to reach the US mainland, reinforcing China's second-strike capacity. The DF-31AG variant, which is road-mobile, enhances survivability by making the missiles difficult to locate and target. This capability sends a strong strategic message to the United States and its allies about China's defensive posture.</p>

The spectacle is visible from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, drawing visitors and online viewers to livestreams provided by the U.S. Geological Survey.

          <p>Multiple national postal services across Europe and India have announced the temporary suspension of most merchandise shipments to the United States. The halt is a response to new US import duties, set to take effect on August 29, which will apply to goods previously exempt from tariffs. Postal operators in Germany, Sweden, Italy, and other nations cite a lack of clarity on the new rules and insufficient time to update their systems to collect the duties. The suspension will affect business customers and online shoppers, though letters and small gifts remain exempt.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old woman in Florida shared her experience of being charged an unexpected $222 by her car insurance provider, National General, after she missed a crucial email.

When she failed to respond by the deadline, her rates were increased significantly. The incident highlights the importance of maintaining clear communication with insurers and being aware of high auto insurance costs, particularly in states like Florida.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has approved a controversial Republican-led redistricting bill, sending it to Governor Greg Abbott, who has pledged to sign it swiftly. The legislation, which redraws the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, passed after a prolonged standoff in the House where Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. The mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by President Trump to bolster Republican chances in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have condemned the new map as a partisan gerrymander and have vowed to challenge its legality in court.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have both been denied parole after separate hearings this week, decades after being convicted of killing their parents in 1989. The parole boards cited the brothers' behavior while incarcerated as a primary reason for the denials, not the original crime itself. Details from the hearings revealed that both had engaged in misconduct, including possessing prohibited mobile phones, with Erik also involved in fights and a tax-fraud scam. Commissioners noted that despite expressing remorse, the brothers still struggled with rule-breaking and deceptive personality traits.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has found that users on the popular gaming platform Roblox are effectively bypassing moderation to spread hate speech, including swastikas and racist slurs. This content is particularly prevalent in the game "Spray Paint!," where players can create graffiti art. Despite Roblox's policies and moderation systems, harmful content persists, raising serious concerns about the safety of its large user base, a significant portion of which is under the age of 13. The platform is currently facing numerous lawsuits related to child safety and inappropriate content.</p>

In contrast, he characterizes Bitcoin as deliberately slow and methodical, prioritizing decentralization, stability, and security above all else. Dorsey suggests that investors should consider whether they prefer a foundation that is fast for today or one that is secure for future generations. (not investment advice)</p>

After receiving the implant at the Cleveland Clinic, the patient, Tommy Fello, has regained movement and reduced pain in his previously non-functional left arm.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a more formal attire for his recent meeting with President Trump, a notable change from his previous 'bunker-chic' look that drew criticism. Zelenskyy wore a black canvas blazer over a collared shirt, a move interpreted as a deliberate act of 'wardrobe diplomacy' to signal a serious, high-stakes conversation. The sartorial shift was well-received, with even a critical reporter commenting positively, and appeared to contribute to a more constructive tone during the visit. This illustrates how clothing choices can serve as a non-verbal communication tool in international politics.</p>
