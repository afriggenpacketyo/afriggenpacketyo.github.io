          <p>An Iranian missile strike injured 23 people in northern Israel, including a 16-year-old boy who was seriously wounded by shrapnel. The attack occurred as European foreign ministers met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva to negotiate a settlement to the ongoing conflict between the two nations. Araghchi stated that Iran is open to dialogue but will not negotiate with the United States as long as Israel continues its strikes on Iran, but is willing to continue discussions with European countries. President Trump indicated the U.S. is ready to engage with Iran and will observe the situation, while Israel carried out strikes on 25 military and nuclear targets in Iran earlier that day. The optimism score is based on the author's reflection of the relative seriousness of the situation.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted by a grand jury in Colorado for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who went missing in May 2020 and whose remains were found in September 2023. Morphew was initially charged with her murder in 2021, but the charges were dropped before trial; the new indictment alleges that Suzanne's death was caused by homicide with butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication, chemicals used for sedating animals. Investigators found that Barry Morphew, a former deer farmer, had access to these substances and had last purchased them in March 2018, and the indictment notes that he was the only private citizen in the area with access to BAM when Suzanne disappeared. Barry Morphew denies any involvement in his wife's death, and his attorney claims the government's predetermined conclusion led their search for evidence, and this article describes the timeline of events and legal proceedings surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>Police are alerting the public to a growing crime trend called "jugging," where criminals target individuals withdrawing large sums of money from banks and ATMs. The "juggers" surveil banks, follow victims to secondary locations, and then rob them, often inside their vehicles. A recent incident in South Carolina was captured on surveillance footage, highlighting the method in which the robbers scope out and watch individuals as they withdraw cash. Texas is working to classify jugging as a specific felony with harsher penalties to combat the rise in these crimes.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is visiting Los Angeles as protests continue over the Trump administration's immigration policies. Vance is touring a Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center, receiving briefings from agencies including the DEA, DHS, ICE, and local law enforcement. The visit coincides with ongoing clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Los Angeles over ICE raids and deportations. A federal appeals court has ruled that Trump can keep the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests against his deportation plans, and Vance has previously attacked the protests and advocated for the passage of Trump's legislative agenda to secure the border.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service reports that the U.S. is bracing for the first significant heat wave of the summer season, with temperatures expected to feel like they're in the triple digits. Cities like Philadelphia have issued code red warnings to move homeless people indoors, while St. Louis could experience days of temperatures feeling like up to 108 degrees. Meteorologists advise that people are not yet acclimated to the heat due to a mild spring, and the NWS urges people to take precautions to avoid heat-related complications, especially pregnant people, children, those with chronic illnesses, and the elderly. The heat waves are lasting longer and peaking at higher temperatures due to climate change, and the U.S. withdrew from the Paris agreement under President Trump.</p>

The judge ruled Rubio's justification unconstitutional and expressed skepticism about the government's requests to keep Khalil detained.

The UKHSA warns of likely significant pressures across health and social care services, including a rise in deaths among those aged 65 and over or people with health conditions.

Trips will be limited to a geofenced area of the city, and remote drivers will be monitoring as a backup.

          <p>Barry Morphew, the husband of Suzanne Morphew, has been re-arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder after her remains were found over three years after she was reported missing. He was previously arrested in 2021 but charges were dropped due to issues with evidence. Suzanne Morphew's remains were discovered in September 2023, and an autopsy ruled her death a homicide by undetermined means, with a cocktail of drugs used to tranquilize wildlife found in her bones. Barry Morphew maintains his innocence, while his attorney criticizes the government's search for evidence.</p>
