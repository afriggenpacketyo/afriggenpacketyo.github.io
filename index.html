          <p>Ten car manufacturers and two trade groups were fined nearly £78 million by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for concealing vehicle recyclability information from consumers for 15 years.  The CMA found that the companies colluded to withhold data on the percentage of recycled materials used in their vehicles, breaching EU law.  This deceptive practice prevented customers from making informed decisions based on environmental concerns.  The fines aim to deter similar anti-competitive behaviors in the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>The Guardian editorial analyzes President Trump's use of tariffs as tools of political power and dominance, rather than economic policy.  The article highlights the potential negative economic impact of Trump's tariffs on the UK and globally, particularly if a trade war ensues.  Trump's actions are viewed as a performance of power, leveraging tariffs to reward loyalty and punish defiance.  The editorial emphasizes the dangerous scale of Trump's tariff strategy and its implications for international relations.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca released encouraging data on its experimental oral PCSK9 inhibitor, a drug designed to lower LDL cholesterol.  The pill showed significant LDL reduction in a mid-stage trial, exceeding expectations and potentially offering a more convenient alternative to injectable treatments.  The results spark a race with Merck, whose oral PCSK9 is further along in development.  The convenience factor and potential for combination therapies could give AstraZeneca's drug a significant market advantage. <i>(not investment advice)<br></i></p>
