          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, causing injuries to at least 19 individuals aboard. Four people sustained serious injuries, though no one fell into the water, and the bridge appears to have suffered no structural damage. The ship was departing for Iceland when the collision occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue with the sailboat as the likely cause. The Brooklyn Bridge was temporarily closed but has since reopened after initial inspections.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis murder sceneâ€”bloody, bare footprintsâ€”led to a decades-long search for Jeanie Childs' killer. The investigation initially focused on Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but he had a solid alibi and his footprints didn't match. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown male profile found on multiple items at the crime scene. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom, a businessman and hockey dad. Westrom denied knowing Childs, but investigators obtained his DNA from a napkin and food container at his daughter's hockey game, confirming the match. He was arrested and charged with Childs' murder.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retail giant stated that tariffs would force them to increase prices, urging the company to absorb the costs instead. Trump claimed Walmart made billions and could "EAT THE TARIFFS" to avoid passing costs to consumers. Walmart responded that they would do their best to keep prices low given small retail margins. Economists warn that tariffs will inevitably drive up prices, leaving businesses to choose between raising prices and laying off workers. The situation arose after Trump temporarily reduced tariffs on China following earlier threats of a trade war.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work opportunities, partnering probation teams with councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The offenders would not receive wages; instead, the money would go into a fund for victim's groups. The government believes this approach will provide more meaningful punishment and ensure that crime doesn't pay, while also addressing public needs.</p>

          <h2>UK's Eurovision Performance Falls Short Despite Strong Vocals</h2>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th out of 26, despite strong vocals and harmonies. The song, "What The Hell Just Happened," was a mix of musical styles that lacked consistency, despite clever lyrics and memorable hooks. The staging, while fun, didn't have the impact of other performances. Politics and vote trading may have also played a role. The band's performance was praised by Graham Norton and Scott Mills on BBC Radio 2, and they made friends across Europe, becoming great ambassadors for the UK in the contest.</p>

          <p>Pop culture has reshaped the public's perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents.

A Los Angeles judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, pending a hearing next month. This shift in public opinion, combined with new evidence of abuse, may influence their chances of freedom. The case highlights society's evolving understanding of trauma and sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>The FDA approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but only for older adults and those over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This restriction limits access for healthy individuals under 65. The approval requires Novavax to conduct studies on potential heart conditions linked to the vaccine, which could cost the company millions. Experts express disappointment and confusion, questioning the rationale behind the health criteria. Critics suggest this decision aligns with the views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is skeptical of vaccines.</p>
