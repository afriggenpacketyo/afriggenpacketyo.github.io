            <p>An American Airlines plane's wingtip struck another American Airlines plane on a taxiway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, according to the FAA. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and airport operations were not affected. Congressman Nick LaLota, who was on one of the planes, tweeted about the incident, describing a loud sound and shaking. The airline stated that the planes have been taken out of service for inspection, emphasizing that safety is their top priority and apologizing to customers for the inconvenience. This incident follows scrutiny of Reagan airport since a fatal collision between a plane and a helicopter in January.</p>

            <p>Senator Josh Hawley has demanded that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify before Congress regarding allegations of Meta's ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). These allegations were made by a Facebook whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, who claims Meta deleted accounts of Chinese dissidents and provided user data to the CCP. Meta denies operating in China and refutes the whistleblower's claims, asserting that Wynn-Williams' testimony is false. The controversy arises amid concerns about a high-stakes AI arms race between the U.S. and China, with allegations that Meta executives misled stakeholders about their dealings with the CCP.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Postal Service has requested a rate increase that would raise the price of a first-class "forever" stamp from 73 cents to 78 cents. The proposal, submitted to the Postal Regulatory Commission, also includes similar increases for postcards, metered letters, and international mail. The USPS argues that the increase is necessary to achieve financial stability, as former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had warned customers to expect "uncomfortable" rate hikes. The proposed changes would raise mailing services product prices approximately 7.4% and, if approved, would take effect July 13.</p>

            <p>A massive short squeeze drove historic gains in the stock market, as hedge funds rushed to cover their short positions amid news of a tariff pause. Short positioning was significantly high ahead of the tariff announcement, leading to a rapid buyback of borrowed stocks when prices surged. This artificial buying pressure resulted in the S&P 500 achieving its third-biggest gain since World War II. The session saw a record-breaking 30 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, highlighting the intensity of the short covering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economist Erica York suggests that President Donald Trump's tariff increases on imports from China could effectively end most trade between the two countries. With the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods now standing at 145%, the cost increases would be substantial. While Trump announced a temporary reduction of tariffs on imports from most countries to 10%, the economist stressed that the market isn't in the clear yet, as the threat hasn't entirely disappeared. The Tax Foundation estimates the new tariffs will increase federal tax revenues by $171.6 billion this year, making it the biggest tax increase since 1993. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has laid out its evidence against detained activist Mahmoud Khalil, largely resting on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The letter alleges Khalil participated in "antisemitic protests and disruptive activities," posing a risk to U.S. foreign policy. Khalil's lawyers argue the administration is trying to silence him for his pro-Palestinian activism. The administration's efforts to deport Khalil have raised concerns about the targeting of immigrants for their political beliefs and activism, with free speech advocates arguing it violates the Constitution.</p>

            <p>European universities are increasingly attracting talent from the United States due to federal funding cuts and perceived attacks on academic freedom.

Consequently, European universities are offering refuge to researchers in the U.S., providing them with opportunities to continue their work in a more supportive environment. This shift marks a potential change in the landscape of academic and scientific research, as the U.S. has traditionally been a central hub.</p>

            <p>President Trump's vow to "end" the U.S. offshore wind industry is casting uncertainty over the Northeast's ambitious renewable energy plans. States in the region have invested heavily in offshore wind, viewing it as crucial for meeting electricity demands, driving economic growth, and achieving climate goals. Trump's administration has paused federal permitting for new offshore wind projects and initiated a review of their environmental and economic impacts. This has led to project delays, factory cancellations, and legal challenges, jeopardizing billions of dollars in investments and thousands of jobs. Despite the uncertainty, proponents remain optimistic about the long-term potential of offshore wind.</p>

In return, Russia is offering critical military assistance to both countries, including submarine technology and air defense systems.

            <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to countries other than their own. The judge expressed concern that the policy lacks adequate safeguards for migrants to raise safety concerns. The policy has been criticized for potentially sending migrants to countries where they have no prior connection or face danger. The Department of Justice argues that new guidance protects the safety of noncitizens, but advocates for the migrants contend that the policy is inadequate. The judge plans to issue a decision on a preliminary injunction next week.</p>

            <p>The UK has sent its military chief, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, to China for the first time in 10 years. Radakin discussed "issues of common concern" with Chinese military leaders in Beijing, according to the Chinese defence ministry. The visit coincided with an escalation in the trade war between China and the US after President Trump's announcement of higher tariffs. Discussions included the importance of military-to-military communications and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is initiating a process to overhaul the $1.6 trillion federal student loan system, which could significantly impact millions of borrowers. Experts predict that the SAVE plan, rolled out by former President Biden, is unlikely to survive legal challenges. Additionally, loan forgiveness under other income-driven repayment plans may be curtailed, and eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) could be narrowed. These changes could reshape how borrowers repay their debt and who qualifies for loan forgiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's decision to pause tariffs on trading partners has led to a surge in freight orders after an initial period of uncertainty. Companies that had put shipments on hold are now releasing them, resulting in increased bookings for logistics providers. However, uncertainty remains high due to the fluid nature of trade decisions and the ongoing trade war with China. The automotive and aerospace industries are examples of sectors where companies are holding back, waiting for more clarity on trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's decision to pause some tariffs, experts warn that the tariffs still in place pose a risk of inflation and recession. The high tariffs on China are expected to raise prices for a variety of products, and the uncertainty surrounding trade policy could lead to an economic downturn. Economists point to the risk of a slowdown for businesses facing higher costs, as well as a potential decline in consumer spending. While the economy remains in solid shape by some measures, the risk of a recession remains elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Meta whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, testified before senators that Facebook worked "hand in glove" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms. Wynn-Williams claimed that Meta provided "custom built censorship tools" for the Chinese Communist Party and removed a Chinese dissident's account under pressure from Chinese officials. She also alleged that Chinese officials could "potentially access" the data of American users. Meta has denied these allegations, calling Wynn-Williams' testimony "divorced from reality and riddled with false claims."

            <p>A study published in Science reveals that trace amounts of anti-anxiety medication, specifically clobazam, found in wastewater can affect the migration of Atlantic salmon. Researchers found that salmon exposed to clobazam were more likely to make it out to sea, possibly because the drug made them less risk-averse. While this might seem beneficial, experts caution that any changes to natural behavior could have negative consequences. The study highlights the widespread presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments and the potential for these chemicals to alter the behavior and ecology of wildlife.</p>

            <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be lower than recent years, but this could change due to potential inflationary pressures from tariffs. Current estimates place the 2026 COLA around 2.2% to 2.3%, lower than the 2.5% increase in 2025. However, if Trump's tariffs are implemented, economists expect consumer prices to rise, potentially leading to a higher COLA for 2026. The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA based on third-quarter data for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). (not investment advice)</p>
