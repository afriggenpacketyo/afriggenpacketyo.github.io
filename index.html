          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has uncovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime, including propaganda material, within its archives during preparations for a historical museum. The discovered items, believed to be linked to packages that arrived in Buenos Aires in 1941, intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina. Horacio Rosatti, the president of the Supreme Court, has ordered a thorough analysis and preservation of the material. Argentina, home to Latin America's largest Jewish population, was a destination for Nazis fleeing after World War II.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico, citing concerns over the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision to protect the nation's food supply and animal health. The USDA said the New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into a wound or mucous membranes of animals and rarely humans. The ban will continue on a month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane as a donation from the Qatari royal family to be upgraded for use as Air Force One. The plane would then be donated to President Trump’s presidential library when he leaves office. Democrats questioned whether the deal was even legal. The move raises substantial ethical issues, given the immense value of the lavishly appointed plane and that Mr. Trump intends to take ownership of it after he leaves office.</p>

          <p>President Trump will sign an executive order aimed at lowering some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. This "most favored nation" pricing model seeks to ensure the U.S. pays the lowest price among its peer countries. The proposal is likely to face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. Drugmakers generate a substantial majority of their worldwide profits from sales in the United States and typically design their business strategy around the U.S. market.</p>

Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.
