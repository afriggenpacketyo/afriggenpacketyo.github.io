          <p>President Trump voiced his support for the cryptocurrency sector, calling it a "very powerful industry" that the U.S. has dominated, amid questions about potential conflicts of interest with his personal crypto ventures. Separately, both the President and House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled potential flexibility on the self-imposed July Fourth deadline for passing the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislative package faces challenges, including the recent rejection of a key Medicaid provision by the Senate parliamentarian.</p>

Economists suggest this is due to several short-term strategies employed by businesses to absorb the initial shock. These tactics include aggressively pre-ordering inventory before tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing costs to avoid scaring consumers, and utilizing logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay or lower duty payments.

The choice between them depends less on earnings and more on other features, as both offer significant returns compared to traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece argues the Supreme Court's decision allowing religious parents to opt their children out of lessons with LGBTQ+ characters will likely impose a de facto "Don't Say Gay" regime on public schools nationwide. The author suggests that to avoid administrative burdens and the threat of expensive lawsuits from anti-LGBTQ+ groups, many school districts will preemptively remove any books or lessons that feature queer themes. This could effectively erase such representation from classrooms entirely.</p>

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," characterizes it as a purposeful return to the electronic and rhythm-focused sound of her earlier work. The album is set in downtown Manhattan and delves into themes of desire, confusion, and a period of personal transition in the artist's late 20s. While praised for its craftsmanship and conversational style, the review notes that the album's introspective focus can sometimes feel insular and muddle its visceral energy.</p>
