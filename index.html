          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly raising $10 billion in a new funding round that values the company at an immense $200 billion. This development highlights the escalating valuations within the AI industry, following similar large-scale fundraising by competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. The new capital is expected to finance the construction of massive data centers and the acquisition of millions of AI chips needed for developing next-generation models. Despite its high valuation and ambitious projects, the company's Grok chatbot has faced controversy and is considered by some to be technologically behind its main rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the 85-page complaint violated federal rules requiring a "short and plain statement." The judge characterized the lawsuit as repetitive, superfluous, and an improper platform to "rage against an adversary." Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint that adheres to court standards. The New York Times has maintained that the lawsuit lacks merit and is an attempt to stifle independent reporting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since late 2024, mortgage rates have fallen, providing significant savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For a $750,000 mortgage, the average 30-year fixed rate has dropped to around 6.13%, reducing monthly payments by over $450 compared to rates at the beginning of the year. This shift offers increased affordability and financial flexibility for borrowers, potentially saving homeowners over $160,000 in interest over the life of the loan. The central bank's move was prompted by concerns over a weakening labor market, signaling a potential for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

The body of Celeste Rivas, who was reported missing in 2024, was discovered earlier this month in the trunk of a Tesla registered to the singer. In addition to the concert cancellations, a scheduled event at the Grammy Museum has also been called off. The singer's representatives have not commented on the show cancellations, but have previously stated he is cooperating with the ongoing police investigation.</p>

          <h2>Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari Supports Two Additional Rate Cuts, Citing Limited Inflation Impact from Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has advocated for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one recently approved by the central bank. He argued that the inflationary effects of President Trump's tariffs are likely a "one-time effect" that will play out over several years, rather than a persistent pressure. This view, combined with a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, gives the Fed room for more accommodative monetary policy. Although Kashkari is not a voting member of the FOMC this year, his comments provide insight into the more dovish perspective within the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Irish governments have unveiled a new inter-governmental deal aimed at addressing the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The framework seeks to replace the UK's controversial Legacy Act, which was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties for including a conditional amnesty. Key features of the new deal include the restoration of inquests, reforms to the legacy investigation commission, and the establishment of a cross-border body for information retrieval. Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris called it the "best, and last, opportunity" to provide truth and justice for victims and their families.</p>

          <p>NATO has intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated the airspace of Estonia, a member of the alliance. The incursion over the Gulf of Finland on Friday prompted Estonia's foreign ministry to condemn the act as "unprecedentedly brazen" and summon Russia's chargé d'affaires in protest. In response to the incident, Estonia has requested formal Article 4 consultations, a treaty provision that triggers urgent discussions among NATO members when one feels its security is threatened. This event follows recent airspace breaches by Russian drones in Poland and Romania, further escalating tensions between Russia and the military alliance.</p>

          <p>The book publishing industry is experiencing a complex relationship with artificial intelligence, simultaneously engaging in copyright lawsuits against AI companies while also producing a large volume of books about the technology. These new works explore the debate between AI "accelerationists" and "doomers," and examine AI's immediate impacts on society, from medicine to politics. Some of the most notable books in this emerging microgenre are fictional or memoir-style explorations of personal relationships with AI. These narratives often use interactions with chatbots not to replace human thought, but to provoke new ways of thinking and writing about consciousness and technology.</p>

Miran, who was the lone vote against the recent quarter-point rate cut in favor of a larger half-point reduction, argued there is no evidence of import-intensive goods inflating at a higher pace. He also suggested that Trump's immigration policies could have a disinflationary effect by easing pressure on shelter prices.

This issue has become a central point in the party's deputy leadership contest, with Phillipson positioning herself as a champion against child poverty.

Following an interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook on launch day, Cramer pointed to large crowds and robust pre-order numbers as signs that Wall Street's initial, more conservative estimates may be too low. He suggested that the combination of new models and carrier incentives could lead to a "breakout moment" for the company's stock. The commentary comes as Apple shares have rallied recently but remain slightly down for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The author recounts personal conversations and events to demonstrate Kirk's consistent support for Israel and Jewish-Christian relations. The article condemns these theories as a reprehensible gaslighting campaign that distracts from the threat of left-wing political violence and threatens to fracture the conservative coalition.</p>

The move follows a call from President Donald Trump to make such a change, arguing it would save money and encourage long-term corporate planning. Atkins stated that if the rule is approved, companies would have the choice to switch to the new schedule or remain with quarterly reporting, letting the market decide the appropriate cadence.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency order to enforce its policy requiring passports to reflect a person's "biological sex at birth," thereby eliminating the "X" gender marker. This policy, which reverses a Biden-era rule allowing for M, F, or X designations, has been blocked by a lower court. The district judge ruled that the policy was likely unconstitutional and motivated by animus toward transgender and nonbinary people.

The boycott coincides with internal pressure on the Israeli film community, as the country's culture minister has threatened to defund the national film academy.
