            <h2>Experts Warn of Potential Devastating Impact of US-China Trade War on African Economies</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Experts are expressing concerns that the ongoing trade war between the US and China could significantly harm African economies, particularly those heavily reliant on exports to China. US tariff policies could reduce African exports, with countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and others that benefit from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) facing the most significant risks. The tariffs could impact resource-rich nations and those with developing clothing manufacturing industries. This situation highlights the interconnectedness of global economies and the vulnerability of African nations to external economic pressures.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite opposition from District Attorney Nathan Hochman. The Menendez brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking reduced sentences and potential parole eligibility under a California law. Hochman had attempted to withdraw a motion filed by his predecessor in favor of resentencing, arguing that the brothers had not fully taken responsibility for their crimes. The judge's decision allows the resentencing process to continue, with further hearings scheduled for the following week.</p>

Mahdi was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer and chose to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or the electric chair. This execution is part of a series of executions resuming in South Carolina after a 13-year pause, driven by the state's difficulty in obtaining lethal injection drugs. The firing squad is a controversial method, but South Carolina lawmakers saw it as a quick and humane way to carry out executions.</p>

The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but also said the judge may have exceeded her authority. Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error" and is allegedly a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyer denies.

            <p>Analysts suggest that the record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could test China's ability to withstand Western economic pressure in a Taiwan Strait crisis. If China can weather the tariffs, it may embolden Beijing in its approach to Taiwan, which it considers part of China. However, any decision regarding Taiwan remains complex, involving political and military considerations. Washington has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports, signaling a strong stance against Beijing's actions.</p>
