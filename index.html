          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that supporters of President Donald Trump interpreted as a veiled threat on the president's life. The post showed seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. Trump and top administration officials rejected Comey's explanation, with Trump calling Comey a "dirty cop" and claiming he was calling for the "assassination of the president."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing due process concerns under the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling sends the case back to an appeals court for further review, indicating skepticism among the justices regarding the government's handling of the deportations. In Congress, five House Budget Committee Republicans blocked their party's major domestic policy bill due to disagreements over budget cuts. The legislation, designed to enact President Trump's agenda, would cut taxes (benefiting the wealthy), increase military and immigration enforcement funding, and reduce health, nutrition, and education spending.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity raised in Special Counsel Robert Hur's report months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Leaked audio from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to recall key details such as the death of his son Beau and the year Donald Trump was elected. Biden responded to questions about the report by asserting his competence and experience. Hur's report declined to bring charges against Biden, in part, because a jury would find him to be a "sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory."</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands collected dust and carried it into the Chicago area, impacting travel and outdoor activities. Visibility dropped to near zero in some areas, forcing drivers to pull over and halting flights at Midway International Airport for about an hour. The skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas affected by the dust storm.</p>

          <p>The trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs hinges on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, who spent four days on the witness stand detailing years of alleged abuse and sexual coercion. Ventura described "freak-offs," where she was allegedly forced to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while Combs watched and recorded, and instances of physical violence. Prosecutors are attempting to build a sex trafficking and racketeering case against Combs, arguing that he used his power and network to control Ventura and cover up his alleged crimes. Combs's attorneys concede that he was abusive but argue that "domestic violence is not sex trafficking."</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear for their survival due to tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods sent to the United States, their biggest market. The tariffs have disrupted expansion plans and threaten to scare off American customers, impacting companies like Ginex, which makes ignition devices for ammunition. The mayor of Gorazde worries that the U.S. has abandoned its faith in free trade and economic development as a path to peace. Bosnia has increased its exports to the U.S. by over 250% in the past five years, making the U.S. a vital lifeline for Gorazde's ammunition industry.</p>

In the Massachusetts case, Judge Shelley Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape ICE. These cases raise questions about the balance between state judges' autonomy and federal officials' authority to enforce immigration law. Some view these prosecutions as political overreach, while others see them as necessary to uphold the rule of law and ensure equal justice for all, regardless of immigration status.</p>

Emirati corporations are investing heavily in ports, mines, renewable energy projects, and other key sectors across the continent. Since 2019, Persian Gulf investments in Africa, primarily by the Emirates, have totaled $110 billion, surpassing amounts pledged by any other country. This push is part of an ambitious plan to diversify the Emirates' economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains, particularly as the Trump administration fast-tracks America's exit from Africa.</p>

The children had been indoctrinated, abused, and separated from their parents, but gradually began to heal through nourishment, play, and the development of trust. Reunions with parents who had left the cult helped break Asahara's grip, allowing the children to reintegrate into society.</p>

          <p>Audio recordings from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden, conducted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur, have emerged, highlighting Biden's memory lapses and halting tone of voice. The recordings, obtained by Axios, confirm Biden's difficulty remembering dates and details, such as the year his son Beau died and the year Donald Trump was first elected. Hur's report described Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," which was a key factor in his decision not to press charges against Biden for his handling of classified documents. The release of the audio has reignited concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, as part of a bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda, are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for health insurance.

Some Americans worry about reduced access to healthcare and having to choose between paying for coverage and necessities.
