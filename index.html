          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit alleges the newspaper published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The article described a hand-drawn card with a naked woman, which Trump vehemently denies creating or sending. This legal action escalates the conflict between Trump and the media entity, coming amid public pressure for more transparency regarding the Epstein case files.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old homeless man, is suing the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep. The lawsuit alleges city employees acted negligently by failing to check inside the tents before clearing the area, a process initiated ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among local advocates, who criticize the city's approach to homelessness as inhumane, especially as it aims to clear encampments before the FIFA World Cup. The family seeks justice and a change in how the city treats its unhoused population.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has altered its operational practices to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical support for its U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The change follows a ProPublica report that highlighted potential national security and cybersecurity risks associated with the arrangement. Previously, U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervised the work of the more technically proficient Chinese engineers, a system critics argued left the Pentagon vulnerable. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the old system "unacceptable," and Microsoft affirmed its commitment to ensuring the security of its services for the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is facing ridicule after promoting a story about a woman allegedly kidnapped by ICE, which federal authorities now claim was a hoax. The Department of Homeland Security publicly called out the mayor after the woman, an undocumented immigrant, was charged with conspiracy and making false statements. Bass had shared a news story about the supposed kidnapping, criticizing immigration enforcement tactics. The Justice Department alleges the woman fabricated the story of being abducted and pressured to self-deport, diverting significant law enforcement resources to the investigation.</p>

          <p>Following an unusually warm and dry spring, the United Kingdom may be heading into a significant wasp season this summer. Pest control professionals are reporting an increase in callouts for large nests appearing earlier than usual. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial role in the ecosystem as apex predators and natural pest controllers. Unlike many other insect populations that are in decline, the common wasp appears to be thriving. To coexist peacefully, experts advise against swatting at them and suggest distracting them with a small amount of a sweet substance placed away from human activity.</p>

The investigation uncovered a defensive production culture and a breakdown in the relationship between the two hosts, who were reportedly never friends off-camera.

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case has become a focal point for many of Donald Trump's supporters, symbolizing a perceived corrupt "deep state" that protects powerful elites. This fascination, rooted in conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon, has created a political challenge for Trump, who once fueled such speculation but now seeks to dismiss the issue as boring. The continued interest from his base puts pressure on his administration to release more information, a situation complicated by Trump's own past association with Epstein. This dynamic pits the president against the very conspiratorial elements he once cultivated within his movement.</p>

The plot is loosely based on an old tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring, turning the story into a comedic quest.

          <p>The announcement that Stephen Colbert's 'The Late Show' will end has ignited discussions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format in the modern media landscape. Industry experts point to declining viewership, the shift of advertising revenue to streaming, and the incompatibility of topical, nightly content with on-demand viewing habits. The cancellation also comes amid political controversy, with some questioning if it was influenced by Colbert's criticism of parent company Paramount's settlement with Donald Trump.

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a common gene variant and certain gut bacteria that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a molecule produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments affect patients differently. The research opens the door for developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific inflammatory pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day trip to China is being interpreted as a sign of Canberra's growing confidence in managing its relationship with Beijing, even amidst pressure from the United States. During the visit, Albanese held high-level talks with Premier Li Qiang and participated in a CEO roundtable, focusing on stabilizing diplomatic and trade ties after a period of tension. Analysts note that Australia's position is not unique in the region, as many countries are navigating the complex dynamics of the great power rivalry. The trip underscores Australia's strategic effort to balance its security alliance with the U.S. and its economic partnership with China.</p>

          <p>An in-depth report reveals the Trump administration's internal struggle over how to handle the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. President Trump was reportedly frustrated and felt betrayed by his MAGA supporters, who continued to demand transparency despite his insistence that they move on. The White House dismissed several options, including appointing a special counsel, before a Wall Street Journal story about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein forced a change in strategy. The episode highlights the president's difficulty in controlling a narrative he helped create and the tensions between governing in reality versus campaigning on conspiracy.</p>

The lawsuit, filed in Nevada, alleged multiple non-consensual sexual encounters occurred during a nearly two-year relationship. Sharpe had consistently denied the allegations, and the specific terms of the settlement were not disclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>Despite being an early pioneer in artificial intelligence with its FAIR research lab, Meta is now seen as lagging behind competitors like OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race. In response, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has launched a new initiative, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), and is aggressively recruiting top talent with massive compensation packages to catch up. The company's previous open-source strategy with its Llama model has not secured a dominant market position. This strategic overhaul signals a high-stakes effort to re-establish Meta as a leader, with a focus on integrating advanced AI into its existing social media and hardware products.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reassigning Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, the first woman to lead the U.S. Naval Academy, and has nominated a Marine Corps general to succeed her. This move, which marks the first time a Marine has been nominated for the role, is part of a broader trend under the Trump administration of removing high-ranking officials, often women or people of color. While a Pentagon official stated the move was not a dismissal and Davids has been nominated for a senior role, it has drawn criticism due to Hegseth's past remarks questioning the role of women in military combat units.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged over 10% in extended trading after it was announced that the company will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase the shares to rebalance their holdings. Despite being down for the year, Block's addition brings more technology weight to the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is still awaiting a final decision on U.S. tariffs after the Trump administration paused a planned 32 percent rate to allow for negotiations. Officials from both sides have met three times since April, suggesting a deal is being worked on to keep any new tariffs at a manageable level. Like other Asian exporters, Taiwan has a large trade surplus with the U.S., which prompted the initial tariff threat. However, the island's critical role as a supplier of advanced semiconductors to major American tech firms adds a layer of complexity to the ongoing trade discussions.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democratic politicians are denouncing CBS's decision to cancel 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' questioning whether the move was politically motivated. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with others, noted the announcement came just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for a $16 million legal settlement with Donald Trump. They suggest the cancellation could be an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration, especially as Paramount seeks regulatory approval for a major merger. CBS maintains the decision was purely financial, citing a challenging economic environment for late-night television.</p>
