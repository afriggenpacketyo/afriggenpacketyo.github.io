          <h2>Data Reveals Sharp Rise in Detention of Immigrants Without Criminal Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 21:04:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the Deportation Data Project indicates a significant shift in U.S. immigration enforcement, with the sharpest growth in detentions occurring among immigrants with no criminal convictions. Approximately half of the 56,000 individuals currently held by ICE lack a criminal record, a figure that has nearly doubled since May. This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing on violent criminals, as exemplified by the recent deportation of a Guatemalan pastor who had lived in the U.S. for 30 years without any criminal history. The findings suggest a broader enforcement strategy where lacking legal status alone is sufficient cause for detention.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blasts, which began Tuesday evening, sparked multiple grass fires and prompted a one-mile evacuation zone. Investigations have revealed that the company, while licensed by the state for importing and exporting fireworks, lacked the necessary local permits to store them on the agricultural property. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is assisting with the investigation into the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released after being held in immigration detention for nearly five months. She was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite having lived in the U.S. since she was a child and having no criminal record. During her confinement, the U.S. government attempted to deport her twice, once in defiance of a judge's order, to a region where she has no legal status. Her case drew significant attention, highlighting the severe conditions in detention centers and the complexities faced by stateless individuals.</p>

          <p>From her home in Tehran, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has issued a warning that the Iranian government is intensifying its repression of citizens, particularly activists, following its recent conflict with Israel. In a message to ABC News, she stated that the regime is using the war as a pretext to increase executions and arrests, aiming to instill fear and deflect from its own failures. Mohammadi expressed grave concern for political prisoners, especially those transferred from Evin Prison after it was struck by an Israeli missile, describing their new conditions as "akin to torture." She urged international organizations to refocus on the deteriorating human rights situation within Iran.</p>

          <p>Recent federal government staffing cuts are raising safety concerns at U.S. national parks, with lifeguard shortages being a prominent issue ahead of the busy summer season. At Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore, for example, visitors are being met with shuttered lifeguard towers and warnings of unguarded beaches. An advocacy group, the National Parks Conservation Association, reports that the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since January due to layoffs and a hiring freeze. Local officials and park advocates fear that the reduced staffing levels could put visitors in jeopardy during a time of peak attendance.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is investigating Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz over suspicious betting activity related to his performance, leading the league to place him on non-disciplinary paid leave. The probe reportedly centers on at least two specific wild pitches thrown in June games, which were preceded by unusual betting action on those pitches being a ball or hitting a batsman. A betting integrity firm flagged the wagers, which originated from Ohio, New York, and New Jersey, to sportsbooks. The investigation highlights the growing concerns surrounding sports gambling and its potential influence on the integrity of professional sports.</p>

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years and cause millions to lose health insurance due to cuts in programs like Medicaid.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's current policies.

In response, the EPA accused the signers of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions.

The survey also found that if an ideological impression is formed, it is more likely to be that the person flying the flag is conservative. Despite these perceptions, the poll shows a broad consensus on the flag as a symbol of national pride, particularly around the July 4th holiday.</p>

          <p>Although not its author, the major tax and spending bill passed by Congress strongly reflects the governing philosophy of Russell Vought, a key figure in the Trump administration's push to fundamentally reshape the federal government. Vought, who has been profiled as a central architect of the administration's agenda, advocates for dramatically reducing the size and scope of federal agencies and entitlement programs. His vision aligns with the bill's deep cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and SNAP, as well as its focus on increasing executive power. The legislation's passage marks a significant victory for his ideological project to deconstruct the modern administrative state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the U.S. economy following the implementation of broad new tariffs reveals a complex and uncertain picture. While the stock market has largely recovered from an initial drop, and overall goods imports remain up year-over-year, signs of a slowdown are emerging in consumer spending and retail sales. Economists note it is still too early to gauge the full impact on consumer prices, as many tariff-affected goods have not yet reached shelves. With a July 9 deadline for the administration's tariff pause approaching, significant uncertainty remains, and a return to more aggressive tariffs could risk a short recession.

          <p>A one-year assessment of the UK's Labour government reveals a mixed record as it navigates significant domestic and international challenges. While making some progress, the government has struggled with key pledges, such as boosting economic growth and reducing net migration, and has faced criticism over U-turns on welfare reform. In foreign policy, it has managed its relationship with the U.S. and sustained support for Ukraine, but faces pressure regarding its stances on China and the Middle East. The analysis shows the administration's ambitious "change" agenda has often been tempered by the harsh realities of governing.</p>

An examination of the publicly listed team members reveals that a majority are graduates of prestigious Chinese universities who later pursued their careers in the United States. This concentration of talent has drawn attention in China and highlights the global competition for leading AI researchers. The formation of the lab has also reportedly increased tensions with rival OpenAI, which has accused Meta of aggressively trying to poach its employees.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 7-2 that the Trump administration can remove a group of eight noncitizens who have been held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The decision clears the way for their potential deportation to South Sudan, a country with which they have no known ties. The ruling overturns a lower court's order that had blocked their removal, stating the men needed more time to contest the deportation. This decision represents a significant victory for the administration's policy of deporting certain immigrants to third-party countries, a practice that has faced numerous legal challenges over due process concerns.</p>

Jeffries used the marathon speech to condemn the legislation as an "immoral document" that would harm millions of Americans by cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs. He argued that the bill represented an "assault on the healthcare of the American people" and would cause immense suffering. Despite his lengthy protest, the bill ultimately passed the House, but his speech served as a powerful, high-profile condemnation of the legislation.</p>

This is particularly contentious as roughly two-thirds of the residents in his Central Valley district rely on the program.
