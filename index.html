          <p>The Trump administration escalated its pressure on Harvard University by halting its ability to enroll international students, citing a Homeland Security investigation into a "hostile learning environment for Jewish students" and Harvard's failure to comply with reporting requirements. This action could affect about 27 percent of the university's student body and significantly impact its finances, as international students tend to pay larger shares of education costs. Harvard has responded by calling the administration's action "unlawful" and vowing to fight back, arguing that it undermines the university's academic and research mission. The university has been praised for fighting back against President Trump and his administration, and legal experts have said the school has a strong case to get back the federal funding for its research that the administration stripped from the school.</p>

          <p>Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in what the FBI is calling an "act of terror." The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody after allegedly shouting "free, free Palestine" following the shooting. Officials are investigating the incident as a hate crime and act of terrorism, with potential additional charges pending as the investigation unfolds. Israeli officials have condemned the shooting as a result of anti-Semitic incitement, while U.S. authorities have pledged to combat antisemitism and prosecute the suspect to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

The former Wall Street executive, who has no prior experience in government or with Social Security, aims to modernize the agency and improve service for the American public. He reassured staff that Social Security is "not going away" and that President Trump supports the program. Bisignano also emphasized the need for a "digital-first" approach and the integration of artificial intelligence into the agency's systems, while addressing concerns about potential staff reductions.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are projected to be the cheapest since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, averaging around $3.08 per gallon, which is 50 cents less than last year. This decline is attributed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, have increased. The cheapest gas can be found in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, while the priciest gas is in California and Hawaii.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted President Trump the authority to remove two members from federal independent labor boards, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, while legal challenges to their firings continue. The court's decision pauses lower court rulings that had previously voided the removals, asserting the president's executive power to remove officers. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, arguing that the firings violated for-cause removal laws. The case raises concerns about the independence of various federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have identified hundreds of metabolites that correlate with ultraprocessed food (UPF) intake, enabling the development of blood and urine tests to detect UPF consumption. The team created a "biomarker score" to predict ultraprocessed food intake based on metabolite measurements in blood and urine. This new method could potentially be used in future research to link the consumption of processed foods with chronic diseases, according to the researchers. The study emphasized that the new method will require further validation before broader use.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is hosting a gala for top holders of his cryptocurrency, $Trump, despite nearly half the attendees having suffered losses from purchasing it. The event is a result of Trump's meme coin competition, where the top holders of the coin won a ticket to a private dinner at Trump National golf club. Despite the president calling the $Trump token “The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”, many have lost money on the coin, and experts raise ethical concerns over pay-to-play policymaking. The SEC has stated that meme coins are “akin to collectibles” and thus “neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.”</p>

Trump responded in stride, but the incident underscores the president's affinity for extravagant gifts.

The court split 4 to 4 over the Oklahoma plan, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recusing herself from the case, and the decision provided no reasoning.

          <p>David Brooks argues that the populist narrative of America's economic decline due to globalization and neoliberalism is historically inaccurate. He contends that wages stagnated mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the era of neoliberal globalism, and median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO. Brooks also points out that American manufacturing has declined primarily due to increased productivity, not foreign competition. He suggests that the forces driving global populism are more about immigration, cultural values, and social distrust than economic factors and that the economic policies of 1992-2017 were sensible and should be built upon.</p>

The study, involving 170,030 adults with obesity and diabetes, found that patients taking GLP-1s had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. While the difference was not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all causes of death. The authors hope to continue their research longer than four years and with those who do not have diabetes.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Seeks to End Court Settlement Protecting Migrant Children</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Agreement, a longstanding court settlement that requires the U.S. government to provide basic rights and services to migrant children in its custody. The Justice Department argues that the agreement has hindered immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings. Attorneys representing migrant children argue that eliminating the agreement would give the government unchecked power to imprison children indefinitely in secret facilities. The Trump administration also seeks to lift a ruling that blocked the Department of Homeland Security from indefinitely detaining migrant families.</p>

          <p>More than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, following a three-day delay after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade. The aid included essential supplies like flour, baby food, and medical equipment. The UN stated that the delays were due to a lack of security along the approved access route. Despite the delivery, the UN emphasizes that the amount is "nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza," where acute levels of hunger and significant shortages persist. The UN and other agencies have said they will not co-operate with US-Israeli plan, saying it contradicts fundamental humanitarian principles and appears to "weaponise aid".</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing the creation of $1,000 "Trump accounts" for babies born during President Trump's second term, aimed at kickstarting wealth creation for American children. The accounts, managed by banks or investment firms, would be automatically enrolled for eligible children, with potential for additional contributions from families and third parties. Funds could be used for prescribed costs such as education or a down payment on a home, but some experts suggest broadening the scope of approved expenditures. The proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable, and the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.</p>

          <p>The UK government has ceded sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, citing legal and practical reasons. The decision focuses on the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, with the government fearing that without ceding sovereignty, the operation of the base would become unworkable due to potential legal challenges. Under the terms of the deal, the UK can effectively veto a foreign power establishing a military presence in the islands. The government also argues that resolving the Chagos row is a diplomatic necessity and is supported by the US and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.</p>
