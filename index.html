          <h2>U.S. House to Recess Early, Avoiding Votes on Release of Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:25:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives will begin its August recess ahead of schedule, a move intended to prevent votes on Democratic-supported motions concerning the Jeffrey Epstein files. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated the decision avoids political maneuvering, arguing the Trump administration is already handling the matter with transparency. Johnson criticized Republican Rep. Thomas Massie for collaborating with Democrats on a discharge petition to force the release of the Department of Justice's investigative files. This political development occurs as the DOJ itself takes steps to increase transparency, including seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts and interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <h2>Louisville, Kentucky Alters Immigration Detainer Policy Following DOJ Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:23:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Louisville's Democratic Mayor, Craig Greenberg, has reversed the city's policy on federal immigration detainers after the Department of Justice threatened legal action. The city will now honor 48-hour detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a shift from its previous practice which led to its designation as a "sanctuary" jurisdiction. In a letter, the mayor indicated the change was made to avoid litigation and the negative consequences of the sanctuary city label, such as a potential freeze on federal funding. Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the move, urging other cities to comply with federal immigration enforcement laws.</p>

          <h2>EU Expresses Concern as Ukraine Moves to Limit Independence of Anti-Corruption Agencies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:23:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has voiced serious concern after Ukrainian lawmakers voted to reduce the independence of the country's key anti-corruption bodies. The legislation places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) under the direct supervision of the Prosecutor General. EU officials warned that this move is a significant setback and could hinder Ukraine's path to EU membership, as the independence of these institutions is considered essential. The vote occurred amid other wartime developments, including a deadly Russian airstrike in Kramatorsk and Ukraine's efforts to secure a new IMF loan for its defense budget.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that high-level trade talks with China will continue next week in Stockholm, Sweden, signaling a potential extension of the current pause on escalating tariffs. This third round of discussions follows previous meetings in Geneva and London aimed at resolving the ongoing trade dispute between the two economic powers. Relations have improved since Washington and Beijing imposed steep punitive levies on each other's exports earlier in the year, with both sides recently noting that "new progress" has been made. The negotiations are critical as an August deadline approaches to avoid the reimposition of triple-digit tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent survey indicated that 44% of U.S. consumers want to increase their protein intake, a trend fueled by social media influencers and the rising use of medical weight-loss drugs. Companies are both launching new protein-fortified items and rebranding existing products to highlight their protein content, with the protein snack market reaching $24 billion in 2024. While some experts caution about the risks of altering familiar products, the market is seeing explosive growth, with some new brands on track for over $100 million in first-year revenue.</p>

          <p>Physicians and health policy experts are warning that significant cuts to Medicaid, estimated at $1 trillion over ten years under new legislation, could destabilize the entire U.S. emergency medicine system. The cuts are projected to leave over 12 million people without Medicaid coverage by 2034, increasing the number of uninsured patients who rely on emergency rooms for care. This will exacerbate the financial strain on hospitals, which already absorb billions in uncompensated care costs, potentially leading to more service reductions and closures, especially in rural areas. Critics argue that while supporters claim the cuts will reduce ER misuse, the reality will be sicker patients and higher overall costs for the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing number of retirees are heavily dependent on Social Security, with about two-thirds stating they substantially rely on the income, up from half in 2005. This increased dependence coincides with declining public confidence in the program's future, as it faces challenges like staffing cuts and a projected funding shortfall by 2034. The survey, marking the program's 90th anniversary, found that 78% of Americans worry Social Security will not provide enough to live on in retirement. Despite its perceived importance across all demographics, many Americans lack basic knowledge about the program, such as the age to maximize benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized the union's decision as reckless, noting that resident doctors have received significant pay rises in recent years. The strike is expected to cause major disruptions, with NHS England directing hospitals to minimize cancellations of non-urgent care, a move the BMA warns could stretch senior doctors thin and risk patient safety.</p>

The author argues that while political motivations and poor ratings are plausible factors, the decision to end the show entirely points to a larger trend. The era of mass-market, apolitical late-night hosts like Johnny Carson, who appealed to a broad audience, is over. In today's fragmented media landscape, platforms cater to smaller, highly engaged niche audiences, making the high-budget, broad-appeal model of the traditional late-night show financially unviable for networks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the common misunderstanding surrounding credit card grace periods, explaining that they apply differently to new purchases versus late payments. Most cards offer a grace period of 21 to 25 days on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their balance in full each month. However, this benefit is typically lost if a balance is carried over. For late payments, there is no official, mandated grace period; fees and penalty APRs can be applied immediately after the due date. While some issuers may offer a brief, informal window, consumers are advised to contact their provider immediately if they anticipate missing a payment to potentially waive fees and minimize credit score damage.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has labeled reports about the deportation of a Chilean resident from Pennsylvania as a "hoax," creating confusion over his status. The man's family had claimed he was detained by ICE and sent to a hospital in Guatemala, but both DHS and the Guatemalan government deny this, stating there are no records of his deportation. Further complicating the story, a Chilean journalist found a death certificate for a man with the same name and birth date who died in Chile in 2019. The family has since ceased communication with the media, leaving the man's true whereabouts and circumstances unconfirmed.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Authorities Intensify Crackdown on Illicit Vaping Products Targeting Teenagers</h2>

          <p>U.S. federal and local authorities are escalating efforts to combat a flood of illicit vaping products from China, many cleverly disguised as everyday items like highlighters and video game consoles to attract teens. Officials report a dramatic increase in seizures, with the domestic value of confiscated products already at $60.3 million in the first half of 2025, far surpassing 2024's total. Despite a ban, flavored vapes remain widely available, and some products contain nicotine levels equivalent to 35 packs of cigarettes. In response, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general is urging the Trump administration to help secure borders against this influx and hold China accountable.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates and maintained its full-year guidance, even as it navigates the financial impact of auto tariffs. The company revealed that tariffs cost $1.1 billion in the second quarter, in line with its full-year estimated impact of $4 to $5 billion. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to significantly reduce its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. Despite beating earnings expectations, the company's net income was down 35.4% from the previous year, and its stock fell in morning trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece from The Atlantic suggests that the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated content, or "slop," across the internet could inadvertently cure our digital addiction. As platforms from YouTube to Reddit become inundated with dubious AI-generated posts and AI-assisted interactions create paranoia on dating apps, the real world is starting to look more trustworthy and appealing. The author argues that the degradation of online experiences, from search results to shopping, makes offline activities like reading books, visiting local stores, and having in-person conversations more attractive. While a complete digital detox is unlikely, the unreliability of AI may push more people to log off and re-engage with the physical world.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party are advocating for new measures to legislate patriotism, including criminalizing negative speech about the country and establishing a national ideology. This move follows the controversial 2023 Patriotic Act, which already imposes severe penalties, including life imprisonment, for actions deemed threatening to national interests. Opposition lawmakers and human rights groups have condemned the proposal as another attempt to silence dissent and shrink democratic space. They argue that true patriotism involves holding the government accountable, not blind loyalty, and that such laws are an abuse of parliamentary power.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications indicates that living through the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated brain aging by an average of 5.5 months, regardless of whether individuals were infected with the virus. Researchers analyzed brain scans from the UK Biobank and found the changes were most pronounced in older people, men, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. While the pandemic's general strain appeared to age the brain, only participants who had been infected with COVID-19 showed a corresponding decline in cognitive abilities like mental flexibility. Scientists suggest the observed brain aging effects may be reversible through lifestyle factors like exercise, diet, and stress management.</p>

          <p>A new analysis ranks U.S. states based on their sustainability and preparedness for the increasing intensity and cost of climate-related disasters. The ranking considers factors like a state's risk from storms, floods, and wildfires, as well as its resilience measures and use of renewable energy. Nevada was named the most sustainable state, setting a gold standard with over 64% of its power coming from renewable sources. Other top-ranking states include Colorado, Vermont, and Maine, which have made significant strides in mitigating climate risks despite facing their own environmental challenges. The report highlights the growing importance of sustainability as climate disasters inflict mounting economic and human costs.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have applied to a compensation scheme established by Harrods for victims of abuse by its former owner, the late Mohamed Al Fayed. The luxury department store confirmed that the scheme, which opened in March and offers payments up to £385,000, has been extended to include employees of one of Fayed's airline companies. Harrods is also taking legal action to replace the executors of Fayed's estate to ensure assets are protected for potential claimants. This follows a BBC investigation that detailed numerous allegations of sexual assault and harassment by Fayed against former employees, which the store helped cover up.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former and current National Park Service employees are warning that significant budget and staffing cuts under the Trump administration are hollowing out the nation's public lands. While visitor-facing services like clean toilets may appear normal, crucial background functions like resource monitoring, trail maintenance, and invasive species removal are being drastically curtailed. Experts say the loss of scientific and maintenance personnel means parks are losing the ability to monitor the health of ecosystems and species, especially under the pressures of climate change. This lack of oversight could lead to irreversible damage to the natural and cultural resources the parks were established to protect.</p>
