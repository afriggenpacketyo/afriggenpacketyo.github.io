          <p>Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, has announced the state's intention to end all vaccine mandates, a move that would include requirements for children attending public schools. If enacted, Florida would become the first U.S. state to remove such public health requirements, which are credited with preventing outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from the public health community, who warn that it could lead to a decline in immunization rates and endanger community health.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has acknowledged she underpaid stamp duty tax on a flat she purchased. The error stemmed from complex legal advice concerning her family home in Greater Manchester, which she said was structured in a trust to provide for her disabled son. Amid calls for her dismissal from political opponents, Rayner has referred herself to the Prime Minister's standards adviser for investigation and has contacted tax authorities to settle the outstanding amount.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that mortgage rates may decrease before the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut in mid-September. Lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of monetary policy shifts, and other economic indicators like the 10-year Treasury yield also play a significant role. This dynamic suggests that prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance might see more favorable rates emerge prior to the Fed's official announcement, although the market remains difficult to predict with certainty.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to significantly reduce or eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is prompting a wave of experienced disaster management officials to leave for the private sector. While the stated goal is to increase state-level responsibility, critics and former officials warn this shift could fragment the nation's disaster response capabilities. States may become heavily reliant on for-profit consulting firms, potentially leading to higher costs and less equitable distribution of aid.</p>

          <p>Christopher Waller, a Federal Reserve Governor and a potential candidate for the next Fed chair, has publicly stated his support for an interest rate cut at the upcoming September policy meeting. He argued that the central bank should act preemptively to avoid a sharp downturn in the labor market, which he noted can deteriorate quickly. Waller suggested that multiple cuts could occur over the next several months, depending on incoming economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

Firefighters are battling the fire, which is part of a larger complex of lightning-caused fires in the region, with no containment reported as of Wednesday.</p>

          <p>Days after a magnitude-6.0 earthquake devastated eastern Afghanistan, rescue operations are being severely hampered by the region's difficult terrain and ongoing aftershocks. The earthquake, which has killed at least 1,469 people, caused mud-brick homes to collapse on sleeping families, and rockfalls are now blocking access to remote villages. Compounding the crisis, the UN World Food Programme has warned that its funding and supplies for Afghanistan are set to run out in just four weeks.</p>

The incident has drawn criticism from figures like J.K. Rowling, who called the arrest deplorable, while others have supported the police's response to incitement.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing debates over Germany's security posture, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, Henning Otte, has called for the reintroduction of mandatory service. He proposed a required year of service for both men and women, which could be completed in the military or in civilian roles like emergency services or cultural work. This position contrasts with the current government's draft law, which favors a voluntary system and has been criticized as insufficient to address modern security challenges.</p>

Wise was charged with multiple felonies, including assaulting police, during the Capitol riot before being pardoned by President Trump. The senators argue that employing an individual who actively attacked the rule of law is a "slap in the face to law enforcement" and undermines public trust in the department.</p>
