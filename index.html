          <p>House Republicans are working long hours to pass President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction package. The House Budget Committee convened late Sunday night to advance the bill, following a previous stall. The Rules Committee also scheduled a late-night meeting to prepare the bill for the House floor, with possible debates and votes stretching into the late hours of the week. The article draws a parallel between the current situation on Capitol Hill and Edward Hopper's painting "Nighthawks," highlighting the weary and detached atmosphere as lawmakers push to finalize the legislation.

Meanwhile, the Kennedy Center announced its upcoming season, which includes some nonunion Broadway shows, a move touted as providing more options for audiences but criticized by Actors' Equity Association.

          <p>Simon Daniel, an 18-year-old Cal State Fullerton student, drowned during a fraternity trip to Lake Havasu. Daniel disappeared while swimming in the Copper Canyon area, and his body was found the next morning.

The 1-year loan prime rate was trimmed to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders moved to reduce their deposit rates. The PBOC is likely to continue to ease policy, forecasting the lending rates to be lowered by another 40 basis points by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>
