          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner in China, suggests that the country should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years. This recommendation factors in potential protracted rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural issues such as property, debt, and weak market confidence. Xu argues that focusing on expanding employment and controlling the debt ratio would be more beneficial than pursuing a higher growth target.

          <p>Spain hosted representatives from European and Arab nations to discuss ways to pressure Israel into ending the war in the Gaza Strip. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an arms embargo against the Israeli government and suggested targeted sanctions on individuals obstructing the two-state solution.

          <p>A Chinese military magazine article suggests that Beijing could cripple Taiwan by targeting key infrastructure nodes, leading to a systemic collapse. The article identifies 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas facilities, that could disrupt electricity, water, traffic, communications, and medical services. This tactic of "urban collapse warfare" is presented as a low-cost, high-efficiency military option to resolve the Taiwan issue, potentially achieving a "win without fighting."

While French wines and spirits global exports fell 4% last year overall, sales of Burgundy wines to the US rose sharply. Mr Labet says the US accounted for about a quarter of Burgundy's wine exports last year. If in July Trump does decide to increase the tariff on all European Union exports to 20%, Mr Labet predicts that the market will almost stop.</p>
