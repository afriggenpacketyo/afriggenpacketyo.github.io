          <p>A British Airways flight from Washington, D.C., to London made an emergency landing in Boston due to a suspected bird strike and smoke in the cabin. The Boeing 777 landed safely at Boston Logan International Airport, and engineers are inspecting the aircraft. There were no reported injuries among the passengers and crew, and the FAA will investigate the incident. Bird strikes have been steadily rising in the U.S. due to growing wildlife populations and increased air traffic.</p>
