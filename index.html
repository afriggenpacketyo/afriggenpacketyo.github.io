          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is returning to the air after ABC ended his "indefinite" suspension, a move that followed significant public and celebrity backlash. The suspension stemmed from Kimmel's comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the network deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to suspend Kimmel was widely criticized as an affront to free speech, drawing condemnation from figures like Howard Stern and over 400 celebrities in an ACLU letter. The network's reversal is seen as a response to the intense pressure and the public relations crisis it created for ABC and its parent company, Disney.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen Airport, Scandinavia's largest, was shut down for several hours after multiple large, unidentified drones were spotted flying nearby, grounding flights and causing significant travel disruptions. Police described the incident as the work of a "capable actor" and have not ruled out the possibility of a Russian hybrid attack, given recent airspace violations in the region. The incident has heightened security concerns across Northern Europe, where NATO allies have accused Moscow of provocations amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Authorities chose not to shoot down the drones due to safety risks associated with the airport's environment.</p>

          <h2>Porsche Shares Decline Sharply After Announcing Electric Vehicle Rollout Delay</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 02:49:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Porsche's stock price dropped over 7% following the company's announcement that it will delay its electric vehicle (EV) rollout, which is expected to negatively impact its 2025 earnings. The German luxury carmaker cited weakening demand for EVs, US import tariffs, and a slowdown in the Chinese luxury market as key challenges. In a strategic shift, Porsche will extend the production of its combustion engine models and launch some upcoming vehicles with gasoline and hybrid options instead of being fully electric.

          <p>Europe is facing a significant geopolitical challenge as its relationship with the United States becomes increasingly unpredictable while its policy toward China remains undefined. Previously, Europe's stance on China often followed Washington's lead, but with the current U.S. administration's transactional approach, that alignment is gone. This leaves European nations grappling with critical questions about trade, technology, and security, particularly concerning China's support for Russia in the war against Ukraine. The article argues that Europe cannot effectively confront the threat from Russia if it is also in the crosshairs of China, forcing it to navigate a complex diplomatic landscape.</p>

          <h2>China Pushed to Develop a Unique Foreign Relations Framework Independent of Western Theories</h2>

          <p>A prominent academic has urged China to create its own unique "knowledge system" for foreign relations, distinct from established Western concepts like realism and liberalism. Zheng Yongnian, a dean at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, argued in a state media interview that such a system is strategically necessary for Beijing to better explain its foreign policy and global role to the world. This call for intellectual autonomy aligns with China's broader push for a multipolar global order and reflects a desire to frame international relations through a China-centric lens. The goal is to move beyond viewing global politics solely through frameworks developed in the West.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions defeated the Baltimore Ravens 38-30 in a Monday night upset, powered by a formidable ground game and a relentless defense. Running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery each scored two touchdowns, and the Lions' offense outrushed the Ravens 224 to 85 yards. Detroit's defense was equally impressive, sacking Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times and forcing a critical fourth-quarter fumble. The victory was a significant road win for the Lions and a surprising physical defeat for the Ravens on their home field, where they have historically been very successful in primetime games.</p>

          <p>A Washington, D.C. man has been arrested and faces federal charges for allegedly aiming a laser pointer at the presidential helicopter, Marine One, while President Trump was on board. According to a Secret Service affidavit, the suspect was spotted acting erratically before shining the laser at an officer and then at the helicopter as it flew overhead. Such actions are considered extremely dangerous as they can blind or disorient pilots, creating a significant risk of a crash. The suspect reportedly told investigators he did not know he couldn't point the laser at Marine One and made comments about wanting to apologize.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has advised pregnant women to avoid the pain reliever Tylenol, claiming a link between its main ingredient, paracetamol, and autism. The administration announced that the FDA will issue a notice to physicians and pursue a safety label change. This move has been met with significant pushback from medical experts and scientific bodies, who state there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship. Major studies, including one involving 2.4 million children in Sweden, found no increased risk, and organizations maintain Tylenol is one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Stephen Miller's eulogy for conservative activist Charlie Kirk characterizes the speech as a distillation of the Trump administration's ideology, framing politics as a battle between pure good and pure evil. Miller's rhetoric depicted political opponents as worthless, wicked, and destined for destruction, using phrases like "we are the storm" and "the light will defeat the dark." The article contrasts this Manichean worldview with Barack Obama's more reconciliatory eulogy following the 2015 Charleston church shooting. It argues that Miller's speech was a convenient pretext to amplify a pre-existing desire to crush political foes.</p>

          <p>Jack Thorne, the writer of the upcoming ITV drama "The Hack," has praised the "remarkable" work of the journalists who uncovered the phone-hacking scandal. The series stars David Tennant as Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter whose investigations exposed widespread illegal practices at the News of the World. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, which journalism struggled to bring to public prominence, the phone-hacking story is a celebration of journalists successfully holding their own powerful industry to account. The drama aims to explore the troubling relationship between the press, politics, and the police that the scandal revealed.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly ordered its major tech companies to stop purchasing Nvidia's B40-series chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The U.S. strategy was to allow China access to less powerful AI chips, thereby slowing its technological progress while maintaining American market presence. However, Beijing has rejected this compromise, viewing the acceptance of "watered-down" technology as an admission of inferiority. This move signals a significant shift in China's strategy, prioritizing technological self-reliance and indigenous innovation over continued dependence on American-controlled global supply chains.</p>

The move is intended to advance a two-state solution, which supporters see as the only path to lasting peace.

          <p>President Trump's press conference advising Americans against Tylenol use during pregnancy represents a significant departure from standard public health communication, relying on personal feeling over scientific consensus. The president pushed a sensational conclusion based on a handful of disputed studies, ignoring larger, more recent research that found no meaningful association between the drug and autism. While his health secretary mentioned an FDA notice, Trump went further, explicitly blaming vaccines and urging parents to alter immunization schedules based on debunked theories.

          <p>Many new parents experience a significant drop in their sex drive after childbirth, a topic explored by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth and relationship experts. The decline can be attributed to a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustment to parenthood. Experts note that the postpartum period involves major changes, with lower estrogen levels potentially causing physical discomfort, while the emotional weight of new responsibilities can affect both mothers and fathers. Open communication between partners is highlighted as crucial for navigating this period and alleviating pressure.</p>

His initial withdrawal was a protest against what he saw as an attack on the freedom of the press. With Kimmel's show scheduled to return, Mamdani reversed his decision and will now take part in the televised event.</p>
