          <p>Kyiv is holding a day of mourning after a major Russian aerial assault killed at least 23 people, making it the second deadliest attack on the capital during the war. The strikes, which also damaged the EU's diplomatic mission, have drawn widespread international condemnation. As recovery efforts continue, EU defense ministers are meeting in Copenhagen to discuss further military support for Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterating the need for new, tougher sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits for the June quarter, largely fueled by a 26% year-on-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division and strong demand for its AI products. Despite this, the company's overall revenues fell short of analyst forecasts, and profits in its core e-commerce unit declined due to heavy investments in the highly competitive 'instant commerce' sector in China. The strong performance of the cloud unit is seen as crucial for the company's strategy to monetize artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have unveiled what they claim is the world's first 'universal' 6G chip, a significant technological development. This innovation aims to overcome the current fragmentation of frequency spectrums by operating across various bands, from mobile phones to satellites. The chip could dramatically increase data transmission speeds, potentially allowing for the transfer of a high-definition movie in seconds and expanding connectivity opportunities for remote areas, rendering piecemeal solutions for different frequencies obsolete.</p>

          <p>The UK government has ordered the removal of a job advertisement for a tutor to teach balloon-craft and cake decorating to migrants at a Heathrow detention center. The move came after criticism from the Conservative opposition, who called the roles indefensible perks for individuals facing deportation. While the contractor, Mitie, stated the activities support detainees' wellbeing, a Home Office source indicated the roles went beyond statutory requirements, prompting a review of activities across the detention estate.</p>

          <p>Germany's unemployment total has exceeded three million for the first time in over a decade, with the rate rising to 6.4%. The Federal Employment Agency attributed the August increase to a typical summer lull in hiring, though it noted the labor market remains weighed down by years of weak economic growth. Employers' associations have criticized the figure as a disgrace and called for political reforms, as the wider German economy continues to struggle with recession and high energy costs.

          <p>An opinion piece examines President Trump's promise to bring back the death penalty for all murders committed in Washington D.C. The author argues the plan is unconstitutional, as it violates a Supreme Court precedent that forbids mandatory death sentences. Furthermore, the article highlights the ugly racial politics of reintroducing capital punishment in a city with a large Black population, given the well-documented history of racial bias in the application of the death penalty throughout the United States.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Ukrainian human rights lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Oleksandra Matviichuk describes the war with Russia as a fundamental conflict between democracy and authoritarianism. She argues that Vladimir Putin is motivated by a desire to restore a Russian empire and is afraid of the idea of freedom spreading to his borders. Matviichuk asserts that sustainable peace can only be achieved through a demonstration of strength, as any negotiation from a perceived position of weakness will only be exploited by the dictator.</p>
