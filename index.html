            <p>Technology stocks experienced a volatile trading session, initially rising before pulling back as market optimism regarding potential tariff delays faded. Nvidia led gains among the "Magnificent Seven," while Apple declined. The sector's movements followed speculation about the White House potentially delaying tariffs, amidst market turbulence sparked by President Trump's wide-sweeping tariff plans. Trading volume surged to near two-decade highs after the Nasdaq Composite's worst week in five years, highlighting the market's sensitivity to trade policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The United States is grappling with its highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 600 infections confirmed across at least 21 states. A significant outbreak in West Texas, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, has contributed to two deaths. Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, noting that unvaccinated individuals face a higher risk of hospitalization and severe complications. Lower vaccination rates are cited as a key factor driving the resurgence of this highly contagious disease, which had been declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is using tattoos to identify and deport Venezuelan migrants as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, raising concerns among experts and law enforcement. While the administration claims these tattoos are reliable identifiers, experts argue that they are not and that the gang does not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership. The Aurora, Colorado Police Chief said his department focuses on criminal activity rather than gang affiliation, and found only nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members in the city in the last two years. The Supreme Court ruled that detainees must receive notice and be allowed to challenge their detention under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

Kennedy has labeled fluoride "industrial waste" and linked it to various health conditions, despite the CDC's assertion that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay by 25 percent.

The average rate on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage jumped to 6.85%. Last week, rates had dropped after President Trump announced global tariffs, causing investors to move to the safety of the bond market. Experts suggest the market is now awaiting new economic data to determine the next direction of mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>U.S. lawmakers have reintroduced a bill that could lead to the closure of Hong Kong's representative offices in America if the White House determines that Beijing has undermined the city's autonomy. The bill would require the U.S. president to explain to Congress why the three Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) should retain diplomatic privileges. The bill seeks to block efforts to promote Hong Kong as a free and autonomous city if the State Department determines that it has lost its autonomy. This action is part of a series of U.S. government efforts targeting Hong Kong.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with the firing of 16,000 probationary federal employees, at least temporarily. The court ruled that the nonprofits bringing the case lacked legal standing to sue over the firings, but did not decide on the legality of the terminations themselves. The ruling makes it more difficult for groups to challenge mass firings, representing a victory for the Trump administration's efforts to shrink federal agencies. A similar challenge is still playing out in lower courts, brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
