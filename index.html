            <p>President Trump defended his administration's tariff policies, admitting to potential transition problems but expressing confidence in the long-term benefits. He emphasized that the U.S. is in a strong position and will ultimately benefit from the tariffs. Simultaneously, the White House increased tariffs on Chinese exports to 145% following Beijing's retaliatory measures. China's Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for using tariffs as a weapon for selfish gains, escalating trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

            <p>The bond market's reaction to President Trump's tariff plans forced a policy reversal to avoid a potential economic crisis. A surge in Treasury yields indicated investors' unease with the uncertainty caused by the tariffs. This market signal, coupled with concerns from figures like Jamie Dimon about an impending recession, influenced the administration's decision to delay additional tariffs. While some officials downplayed the bond market's role, it's clear that investor anxiety played a part in the policy adjustment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Major League Baseball is contemplating the implementation of a salary cap and floor as the league approaches a new Collective Bargaining Agreement in 2026. The MLB Players Association has historically opposed a salary cap, setting the stage for a potential lockout. The disparity in spending between high and low-spending teams has reached record levels, prompting discussions about competitive balance. While a salary cap could help smaller market teams retain star players, the MLBPA views any restrictions on player earnings as unacceptable.</p>

            <p>Economists predict that President Trump's tariff agenda and the resulting trade war will lead to higher consumer prices by the summer. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, will likely be passed on to consumers, reducing their purchasing power. While federal inflation data doesn't yet reflect the full impact, experts anticipate food and physical goods to become noticeably more expensive. Capital Economics expects the consumer price index to peak around 4% in 2025, double the Federal Reserve's long-term target.</p>

            <p>Inflation eased in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but President Trump's tariffs could disrupt this downward trend in the coming months. The consumer price index rose 2.4% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 2.8% in February, indicating decelerating inflation. However, economists warn that tariffs, a tax paid by U.S. importers, will add costs for businesses that will ultimately be passed on to consumers. Trump's tariff policy could push the U.S. inflation rate to a peak around 4% by the end of 2025.</p>

            <p>Cryptocurrencies experienced a pullback alongside the broader market as investors reduced gains from the historic rally following the tariff pause announcement. Bitcoin's price decreased by more than 4%, and other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana also declined. Investors are increasingly concerned that economic activity could be slowed despite the short reprieve on some tariffs, as Trump singled out China with a much higher rate. Bitcoin's resilience amid recent market volatility has been noted, with some analysts viewing it as a reliable store of value. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the article mentions that this progress on inflation could stall as a result of the president's trade war. Trump suspended many of his new tariffs on Wednesday, but he left in place a 10% tax on nearly everything the U.S. imports from other countries.</p>
