          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States, which is classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon. Jian and Liu allegedly received Chinese government funding for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. Jian's electronics reportedly contain information indicating her membership in the Chinese Communist Party, and Liu admitted to smuggling the fungus to conduct research at the University of Michigan. The fungus causes "head blight," a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses annually.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the revocation of guidance to hospitals that directed them to provide emergency abortions to women when necessary to stabilize their medical condition. The Biden administration issued the guidance in 2022 following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn national abortion rights, aiming to preserve abortion access in extreme cases. An Associated Press investigation revealed that many pregnant women were still being turned away from emergency rooms, even with the guidance in place. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stated it would continue to enforce the law but also rectify perceived legal confusion created by the previous administration's actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships named after civil rights leaders, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents obtained by CBS News indicate that the proposed name changes are intended to realign the U.S. military with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." Other vessels on the renaming "recommended list" include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman. The potential name changes have sparked controversy, with some criticizing the move as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality.</p>

Last year's norovirus season began in October, earlier than usual, driven by the emergence of GII.17, which has now become the dominant strain in the U.S. Several other countries also experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus infections after GII.17's surge. Researchers are uncertain whether GII.17 will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season or if GII.4, the previously dominant strain, will regain prevalence.</p>
