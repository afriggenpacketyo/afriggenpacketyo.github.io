          <p>The U.S. State Department has directed embassies worldwide to inform host governments that the U.S. is not involved in Israel's unilateral strikes against Iran and did not provide tanker support. The ALDAC cable emphasized the U.S. commitment to a diplomatic resolution regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions, stressing that the safety of American citizens is a top priority and warning against targeting them. This directive follows intensifying clashes between Israel and Iran, with casualties reported on both sides, as Iranian officials accuse the U.S. of being complicit in the attacks. The U.S. has also closed its embassies in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv due to security concerns, while President Trump has called for a deal to de-escalate the conflict. Optimism is low amid escalating tensions and accusations.</p>

          <p>China's economic data for May sent mixed signals, with US tariffs impacting manufacturing and exports, while domestic consumption showed signs of recovery. Retail sales rose by 6.4%, exceeding expectations, driven by online shopping festivals and government initiatives. However, Zhang Yuhan, principal economist at The Conference Board’s China Center, said the retail data “appeared to be strong” – especially in the dining and home-appliances segments – which was likely driven by “holiday effects combined with the continued effects of consumption-promoting policies”.</p>
