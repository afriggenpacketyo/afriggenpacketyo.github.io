        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global spirit makers are facing a challenging environment due to tariffs, brand boycotts, and shifts in consumer drinking habits. Rémy Cointreau, following Diageo and Pernod Ricard, withdrew its sales targets due to economic and trade uncertainties, particularly related to U.S.-China tariff policies and a slowing U.S. market. The cognac business of Rémy Cointreau experienced a 22% drop in sales due to reduced consumption in the U.S. and complex market conditions in China, with other brands like Hennessy also seeing declines. This is coupled with an overall correction in distilled spirits in the U.S., further complicated by U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Maryland leaders have expressed their views on the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. to face federal charges after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, who illegally entered the U.S. in 2011, was deported in March but his case gained attention due to concerns about due process. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Glenn Ivey, who advocated for his return, emphasized that the issue is about constitutional rights and ensuring due process for everyone in the United States. Abrego Garcia is accused of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people, and his attorneys have denied allegations of gang ties.</p>

          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was unintentionally shot and killed by a fellow officer during a chase in Chatham. The officers, part of a tactical team, were attempting an investigatory stop when the suspect fled into an apartment, leading to a confrontation where a second person pointed a rifle at them. During the incident, an officer discharged a weapon, accidentally striking Officer Rivera, who later died at the hospital after the vehicle transporting her caught fire due to a mechanical issue. The investigation remains open, and the city mourns the loss of Officer Rivera, a four-year veteran of the department and a mother, with concerns raised about the mental wellbeing of fellow officers in the district.</p>

          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations conducted by Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI across Los Angeles led to dozens of arrests and citywide protests. Federal agents executed search warrants at locations in the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., resulting in the administrative arrest of approximately 44 people. Protests broke out in response, with demonstrators marching through the streets and clashing with LAPD officers, who used less-than-lethal rounds to disperse the crowds.

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year, with immigration officers arresting over 6,400 people during raids at businesses. The government is focusing on employers who exploit undocumented migrants, subjecting them to poor conditions and low wages. Immigration Enforcement Director Eddy Montgomery stated that many migrants are deceived by smuggling gangs and face inhumane working conditions. The government is cracking down on illegal migration, with nearly 30,000 people returned over the past year, and tightening work visa regulations to address the issue.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by Grant House, enables schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and provides $2.7 billion to former players who were previously barred from revenue sharing. This move professionalizes college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program adjustments, while also raising concerns about roster limits and the future of Olympic sports. NCAA President Charlie Baker noted that the agreement opens a pathway to stabilize college sports.</p>

This agreement arose from lawsuits challenging the tradition of amateurism, as top-level athletic departments generate substantial revenue from various sources.

          <p>Three residents have filed a lawsuit against Sonoma County, alleging that code enforcement is using drones to take aerial images of their homes without warrants. The ACLU is supporting the residents, calling the practice a "runaway spying operation." The county began using drones to track illegal cannabis cultivation in 2019, but has since expanded their use to other code violations. The lawsuit raises concerns about privacy rights and unreasonable searches, as the drones are equipped with high-powered cameras and zoom lenses.</p>
