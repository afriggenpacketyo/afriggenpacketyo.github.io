          <p>The Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 to leave the U.S., sparking criticism for its potential deception. Critics argue the program's claim of preserving future legal re-entry options is misleading. Simultaneously, the White House is exploring ways to protect the US film industry after Trump announced a 10% tariff on movies produced abroad, causing production company shares to fall. This move is the latest in a series of immigration and trade policy adjustments under the administration.</p>

          <p>Mark Zaid, a prominent whistleblower attorney, is suing the Trump administration to restore his security clearance, alleging it was revoked as political retribution. Zaid argues the revocation undermines his ability to represent clients effectively, as he can no longer access relevant classified information. The lawsuit claims Trump's memo revoking clearances of over a dozen individuals violates the First and Fifth Amendments. Zaid believes he was targeted due to his representation of a whistleblower in the 2019 impeachment proceedings against Trump.</p>

Greenish discoloration suggests a metal crown was once worn, and physical features match Corvinus' age and height. Further research, including DNA and isotope analyses, is planned to learn more about the skull's origins.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, aligning with the Biden administration's earlier stance.

          <p>India is concerned about Chinese 'dumping' of cheaper imports, particularly viscose yarn, as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. With Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, manufacturers in China are seeking alternative markets, leading to an influx of cheaper products into India. This has slowed down demand for locally made goods, causing anxieties across various sectors in India. The Indian trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with quasi-judicial arms probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.</p>

The research, involving experiments with potentially pandemic-causing pathogens, has been controversial due to fears of accidental releases.

          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal has found that getting a shingles vaccine may lower the risk of cardiovascular events by 23% for up to 8 years. The study examined over 1 million people aged 50 or older. The protective effect was particularly prominent in men, people under 60 and those who smoke, drink or aren't active. The vaccine analyzed was a live zoster vaccine, and more research is needed to confirm if the recombinant vaccine, Shingrix, has a similar impact.</p>

The automaker expects to offset $1 billion of those costs. Ford cited near-term risks, especially potential supply chain disruptions and increased tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance. The automotive industry is grappling with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts.</p>
