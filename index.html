          <p>A 43-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the deaths of a two-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy in Stafford, UK. The children were discovered with injuries and unresponsive at a residence on Sunday morning and were pronounced dead at the scene. Staffordshire Police are conducting a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. The incident has also been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because of previous police contact related to the address, and authorities have asked the public to avoid speculation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 16:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of California, Irvine, has uncovered the mechanism by which dietary fiber protects the body from the harmful effects of fructose. Researchers discovered that inulin, a fiber found in foods like garlic and onions, reshapes gut bacteria to metabolize the sugar in the small intestine before it can reach and damage the liver. This process not only prevents the buildup of liver fat but was also shown to reverse signs of fatty liver disease in study participants. The findings could pave the way for personalized nutrition strategies to improve metabolic health.</p>

The agreement, brokered by US President Donald Trump, has initiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, marking a significant step after two years of conflict. During the summit, Starmer is expected to acknowledge the diplomatic efforts of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. However, claims from UK officials about playing a "key role" in the process have been publicly disputed by representatives from both the US and Israel.</p>

          <p>Former NFL player and current Fox Sports commentator Mark Sanchez has been booked on a felony battery charge after being released from an Indianapolis hospital. The charge stems from an altercation with a 69-year-old truck driver, which allegedly began as a dispute over parking and escalated into a physical fight. Both men sustained injuries, with Sanchez suffering several stab wounds and the truck driver receiving a severe facial laceration. The truck driver, who claims he acted in self-defense, has also filed a civil lawsuit against Sanchez and his employer.</p>

          <p>A new super PAC, named Vote Common Sense, has been established to support Republican Curtis Sliwa in the final weeks of the New York City mayoral election. This marks the first such independent expenditure group to back Sliwa, who is currently polling in third place behind Democrat Zohran Mamdani and independent Andrew Cuomo. The PAC has already invested over a quarter-million dollars in a television ad campaign critical of Mamdani's policies. The group's formation introduces a new dynamic of outside spending into a race already characterized by significant financial influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its twelfth day, Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" for their refusal to fund the government without certain conditions. The central point of contention is the Democrats' demand to extend expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Republicans oppose. Vance asserted that the administration will not negotiate on healthcare policy until the government is reopened. The political impasse has already led to the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, a consequence Vance attributes to the Democrats' actions.</p>
