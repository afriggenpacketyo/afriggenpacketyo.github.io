          <p>Musician Paul Simon has canceled two concerts in Philadelphia due to chronic and intense back pain that has become unmanageable. The 83-year-old singer-songwriter is scheduled to undergo a minor surgical procedure in the coming days to address the issue. His team expressed hope that the surgery will allow him to complete the remainder of his "A Quiet Celebrations" tour, which was already designed around intimate venues to accommodate his recent severe hearing loss.

          <p>Turkish police in Istanbul detained over 50 people and blocked attempts to hold the annual LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which has been banned by authorities since 2015. The city's governor cited the event as a threat to "social peace, family structure, and moral values." Despite a heavy police presence, activists and an opposition lawmaker attempted to march, leading to clashes. The crackdown reflects President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, which human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile environment of discrimination and violence.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not run for reelection in 2026, a decision that came hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The threat was a response to Tillis's opposition to a major tax and spending bill, which he argued contained Medicaid cuts that would harm his state. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, noting it has become an "endangered species." His departure opens up a key Senate seat in a historically Republican state.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, Japan, is facing a significant backlash after accusing her former boss, chief prosecutor Kentaro Kitagawa, of sexual assault in 2018. The prosecutor, identified by the pseudonym Hikari, alleges that after the incident, she was subjected to a campaign to silence her and was slandered by a colleague. Kitagawa was indicted and initially admitted to the charge but has since recanted, claiming the encounter was consensual. The case highlights the challenges faced by victims of sexual assault in Japan, particularly when accusing powerful figures within established institutions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is pledging increased action in response to a significant rise in attacks on religious facilities, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon described the attacks as a form of terrorism meant to deter people from practicing their faith. The department has recently secured lengthy prison sentences in cases involving planned attacks on churches, highlighting a more focused effort to combat this trend. The rise in threats is partly attributed to white nationalism and the targeting of minority or LGBTQ-welcoming congregations.</p>

Thousands of reported sightings, though unconfirmed, fuel a dedicated community of seekers who use trail cams and forensic techniques to search for the creature in the Tasmanian bush. This passion extends to the scientific community, where a de-extinction project led by the University of Melbourne aims to bring the tiger back by editing the DNA of its closest living relative. The quest reflects a blend of hope, folklore, and remorse for the animal's extinction.</p>

A notable incident involved drones repeatedly flying over Langley Air Force Base for 17 nights, forcing the relocation of advanced F-22 fighter jets. Similar incursions have been documented at nuclear plants and other critical facilities since 2019, with the drones' origins and operators remaining unknown.

          <p>This article profiles the acclaimed and unconventional 82-year-old German filmmaker Werner Herzog, known for his more than 70 feature films and documentaries that explore extremes of nature and human sanity. From hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for "Fitzcarraldo" to documenting the life of "Grizzly Man," Herzog's career is defined by his relentless pursuit of authentic, often dream-like cinematic experiences. He emphasizes a "good criminal energy" and real-life experience over formal training, even teaching his students lock-picking and permit forgery as essential filmmaking skills, believing his prose will ultimately outlive his films.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of Sealand, a micronation located on a World War II sea fort seven miles off the English coast. Founded in 1967 by Roy Bates, a former pirate radio operator, the self-declared principality has its own constitution, currency, and a royal family, with a full-time population of one. The story recounts Sealand's bizarre history of fending off invasions, staging a counter-coup against German diamond merchants, and a diplomatic incident that led to de facto recognition. Today, the Bates family sustains the nation by selling noble titles online, continuing their unique legacy.</p>

          <p>Stopping the mysterious drone swarms over sensitive U.S. sites presents significant technical and legal challenges. Standard radar systems often cannot track the low-flying aircraft, and simply shooting them down over populated areas poses a major safety risk from debris. Jamming the drones' communication frequencies is also problematic as it can interfere with civilian services like Wi-Fi and GPS. Jurisdictional confusion between agencies like the FAA, FBI, and Department of Defense further complicates a coordinated response. The military is now developing "fly-away kits" with new technology to deploy to besieged installations.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) needs reform, as its current structure can cause savers to receive less money than they invested. LISAs, designed for first-home purchases or retirement, offer a 25% government bonus but impose a steep penalty for early withdrawals not used for these purposes, resulting in a 6.25% loss of the user's own capital. The Treasury Committee report highlighted a surge in penalty-incurring withdrawals and noted the product's complexity may be unsuitable for many, particularly those on benefits.

Previously considered one of the safest modern aircraft, the 787 has a history of production issues and whistleblower allegations regarding quality control at its South Carolina plant. Former employees have claimed that pressure to speed up production led to the use of substandard parts and improper assembly, creating potential safety risks. While Boeing insists the aircraft is safe and has a strong operational history, the crash has brought these long-standing concerns back into focus.</p>

The writers, nearly all young women, published on a Taiwan-hosted site and are accused of producing and distributing obscene material, a charge that can carry a lengthy prison sentence. The genre has a massive following among young women in China, who see it as a subversive space to explore desire outside of traditional gender roles.

While the President claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the damage only set back Iran's program by months, with underground structures potentially intact. As the week progressed, top aides appeared to shift the goalposts, emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing solely on the destruction of the nuclear program.

          <p>An emaciated newborn baby was rescued by police from a Phoenix apartment, where the infant had survived alone for several days after its mother had died. Officers forced entry into the home for a welfare check after a neighbor reported not seeing the woman for days. Bodycam footage shows the moment officers found the baby alive on a bed near the motionless mother. The infant was rushed to the hospital in serious condition but is now expected to make a full recovery. Authorities praised the neighbor's call and the officers' swift actions for saving the child's life.</p>

          <h2>Residents of Occupied Mariupol Describe Life of Ruin and Propaganda</h2>

          <p>In interviews with the BBC, residents of Russian-occupied Mariupol have described a grim reality that starkly contrasts with the "fairy tales" presented on Russian television. They report that much of the city remains in ruins, with severe water and medicine shortages and frequent power cuts. Residents also describe an intense propaganda effort in schools, where children are taught a false history of Russia's invasion and are forced to participate in Soviet-style traditions. Despite the risks, some residents are engaged in a secret resistance, gathering intelligence for the Ukrainian military and spreading pro-Ukrainian messages.</p>

          <h2>Plan to Sell Public Lands in the West Removed from GOP Bill After Bipartisan Backlash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 16:56:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill. Senator Mike Lee, the proposal's sponsor, withdrew the measure amid strong bipartisan backlash from lawmakers in both the House and Senate, as well as from conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to corporations or foreign interests. Conservationists celebrated the move as a victory but warned of ongoing threats to federal lands.</p>
