          <p>President Trump is scaling back the U.S.'s role in the world based on his "America First" agenda, challenging the global order established after World War II. He views alliances, treaties, and soft power as expensive and outdated, preferring unilateral action. This approach includes scaling back military commitments, pursuing high-stakes diplomatic deals, and implementing protectionist trade policies. Trump's actions are raising concerns about the future of NATO and the U.S.'s willingness to defend Europe, as well as the stability of the global economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a large percentage of Americans struggling with debt due to high interest rates and inflation, defaulting on debt can lead to serious consequences. Defaulting can severely damage credit scores, result in debt collections and legal action, and lead to added fees and financial stress. If falling behind on payments, individuals should contact creditors to explore hardship programs, consider debt consolidation, or seek credit counseling. Bankruptcy may be an option for severe situations, but it's essential to understand the risks and take action to avoid default and secure a healthier financial future.</p>

          <p>Thirty-five House Democrats voted with Republicans to block a Biden administration waiver that would have allowed California to ban gas-powered car sales by 2035. The Republican resolution passed with a 246 to 164 vote, with some Democrats expressing concerns about consumer choice and the feasibility of transitioning to electric vehicles. Republican leaders praised the resolution, arguing that Americans should have the freedom to choose the car that best suits their needs. The move represents a significant challenge to California's clean energy goals and highlights the ongoing debate over federal regulation of environmental policies.</p>

          <p>While many pronatalist policies are being considered, experts agree that giving money directly to parents is one of the most beneficial for children. A baby bonus could allow parents to take more leave, defray birth costs, and provide financial stability, positively impacting children's health and learning. The expanded child tax credit during the Biden administration demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by significantly reducing child poverty. Experts emphasize that policies supporting food, housing, healthcare, and education are crucial for ensuring children's well-being and future stability.</p>

          <p>A state-backed Emirati firm's $2 billion deal using a Trump-affiliated digital coin was announced at a conference featuring President Trump's son and a business partner. The deal, involving World Liberty Financial's stablecoin, raises ethical conflicts due to the blurring of business and government. MGX's use of the coin creates a formal link between World Liberty and Binance, which has faced U.S. government oversight. The announcement highlights the potential for partnerships with a company tied to President Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is rewriting crypto rules, marking a "180 pivot" from the Biden years, according to industry insiders. Actions like creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and rolling back SEC enforcement tactics have been welcomed.

          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers purchasing new vehicles ahead of potential tariff-related price increases. Consumers were buoyed by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices steady. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices rose. Experts predict the good times may not last due to higher costs and lower vehicle inventories, potentially leading to lower sales in the future.</p>
