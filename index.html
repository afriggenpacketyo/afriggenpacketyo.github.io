          <p>President Trump announced Michael Waltz's nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor. The move follows Waltz's scrutiny after inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal chat discussing a U.S. military strike. Vice President JD Vance stated Waltz was brought on to reform the National Security Council and would be better suited as UN ambassador. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learned about Rubio's appointment during a press briefing, praising his versatility and familiarity with the president, and Trump defended Waltz after the Signal mishap, stating he had learned a lesson.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs rejected a plea deal during a pre-trial hearing in his sex trafficking and racketeering case in New York City. Jury selection is set to begin next week, with prospective jurors already completing questionnaires. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including transportation to engage in prostitution and sexual assault trafficking, faces decades in prison if convicted. The defense team raised concerns about an alleged victim's attorney's conduct, and the judge reminded all attorneys to adhere to professional conduct rules.

          <p>BBC Verify tracked Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler, documenting his activities across three continents after a migrant boat was rescued off the north African coast, during which 50 people died. Gujjar, from Pakistan's Punjab region, promised safe routes to Europe but backtracked, leading to the deaths of two migrants, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, on a journey from Mauritania. Survivors paid Gujjar an average of $13,000 for false promises of safe and legal routes to Europe, and were held in "safe houses" in Nouakchott. The boat journey turned deadly, with migrants suffering starvation, dehydration, and beatings, resulting in numerous deaths.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting faces criticism for watering down funding levels for maternity safety, despite previous commitments to invest almost £100m annually following a report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. Only £2m of the funding is now guaranteed for maternity care this year, with the rest given to Integrated Care Boards to decide how to allocate it. Campaigners, including Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter due to poor care, have labeled the decision a betrayal. The Royal College of Midwives described the funding decision as taking "a wrecking ball" to maternity safety, fearing budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking dismissal of the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and other alleged violations. The defense argues that concurrent state and federal prosecutions violate Mangione's constitutional rights. They also seek to suppress statements Mangione made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming officers failed to provide Miranda warnings. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges, the latter of which could result in the death penalty if convicted, and the defense argues the state case infringes on rights afforded to him in the federal death penalty case.</p>

Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but consistent with February's figures. These numbers contrast sharply with the high influx of migrants under the Biden administration. Trump administration officials attribute the drop to the president's immigration crackdown, including rapid deportations and increased border security.

The eviction comes after the Trump administration directed federal agencies to increase timber production and forest management.

          <p>President Trump is set to close a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which will increase prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These retailers have relied on the "de minimis" exemption to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. The move aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids, as the administration believes Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages. The change will subject packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to import duties, impacting online shoppers who will likely see price increases.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors are implementing a new policy to expedite the filing of felony charges in sexual assault and family violence cases, following the death of a 13-year-old boy. The policy requires the filing of a criminal complaint within one business day of a decision to seek an arrest warrant. The announcement comes after a report highlighted how a backlog of cases in the district attorney's office may have delayed charges against a soccer coach accused of murder in the death of one of his players. Current Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman has said he has stepped up efforts to clear the queue in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Apple's second-quarter financials exceeded Wall Street's expectations, with revenue of $95.4 billion and earnings-per-share of $1.65. CEO Tim Cook expects tariffs to add $900 million to costs for the upcoming quarter, assuming tariff rates remain stable. The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading due to the tariffs news and weaker-than-expected services revenue. Apple is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, but Cook stated that India and Vietnam would produce more iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Analysts suggest the tariff confusion could benefit Apple in the short term, as consumers rush to purchase products before potential price increases.</p>

          <p>Australia's federal election on May 3 is overshadowed by Donald Trump's second presidency and his imposition of tariffs, forcing candidates to address how to deal with an unpredictable US president. While domestic issues like cost-of-living, housing, and healthcare are priorities, the focus has shifted to Australia's relationship with the US. Despite the US being a key ally, Trump's actions are causing concern. The Labor Party's Anthony Albanese is attempting to reassure voters of his ability to navigate these international challenges, potentially benefiting from a rallying effect during a perceived crisis.</p>

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted that the cost of AI for customers will decrease over time due to Amazon's custom chips.

The board acknowledges Trump's legitimate election and some effective policies, such as border control and reorienting federal programs. However, it emphasizes the need for a broad coalition to oppose his undemocratic actions, including attacks on separation of powers, due process, equal justice, and free speech. The board calls for principled and strategic opposition, citing Harvard University's response to threats of funding cuts as a model.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce is advocating for tariff exclusions for U.S. small businesses that import goods, citing the potential for serious damage to Main Street due to recently imposed tariffs. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber requested an "automatic exclusion" to save small businesses and prevent a recession. The organization argues that small businesses lack the capital to withstand increased tariffs, which could force them to raise prices or close. Senator Ed Markey also called on the Trump administration to grant tariff exemptions to small enterprises.</p>
