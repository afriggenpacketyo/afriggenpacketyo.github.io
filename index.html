          <p>Costco announced robust fiscal fourth-quarter results, exceeding Wall Street's earnings and revenue forecasts, primarily driven by significant growth in membership income and its e-commerce business. The company's CFO highlighted efforts to counteract rising tariff costs by diversifying merchandise and expanding its Kirkland Signature private-label brand. Although shares experienced a slight decline in extended trading, Costco's full-year revenue saw an 8.1% increase, and it plans substantial expansion with 35 new warehouses. This strong performance underscores the retailer's success in attracting a diverse and growing member base by offering value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive memorandum establishing a comprehensive strategy to combat organized political violence and domestic terrorism, explicitly targeting what he calls a radical left-wing network. This move, which critics fear could be used for a broad crackdown on political opponents, follows recent incidents like the murder of a far-right pundit and an attack on an ICE facility. Trump hinted at wealthy funders like George Soros and Reid Hoffman, though authorities have indicated that recent suspects acted alone. The administration frames this as an unprecedented, all-of-government effort to dismantle left-wing terrorism, drawing significant pushback from civil liberties advocates.</p>

          <p>Ty Anthony Sage, a murder suspect, was successfully re-arrested in Florence, Oregon, after an administrative error led to his mistaken release from prison on bail earlier in the week, triggering a multi-day manhunt. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office confirmed that despite a bail denial, an erroneous release order was processed. An internal review is underway to investigate the systemic failure, with the sheriff vowing to prevent future occurrences and ensure justice for the victim's family, who expressed profound distress. This incident, while isolated, highlights critical procedural vulnerabilities within the justice system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, during an Oval Office signing event, publicly disparaged Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, labeling her a "very low IQ person" and expressing disbelief at her congressional position. He further escalated his rhetoric by recalling a past interaction with Somalia's leader, suggesting he "take back" Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was born in Mogadishu. These off-script comments, which included grouping Crockett with the progressive "Squad," reignited long-standing criticisms Trump has directed at these lawmakers. The remarks, met with laughter by some attendees, underscore the highly polarizing nature of his political commentary and approach.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a highly unusual and large-scale meeting of hundreds of senior military leaders, from one-star generals and admirals upwards, to convene next week at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. The purpose of this rare assembly, which will include the Defense Secretary, remains largely unknown, fueling widespread speculation among U.S. officials. This gathering occurs months after Hegseth mandated a 20% reduction in four-star officer ranks and removed 15 senior military officers.

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the article examines the nation's globally unrivalled manufacturing supply chains, noting their existing weak links despite decades of refinement. Even for products seemingly "made-in-India," core components often originate from China, underscoring its deep integration. Policymakers are anticipated to leverage this blueprint to bolster supply chain resilience, advance up the value chain, and tackle critical high-tech vulnerabilities.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has sharply criticized Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's economic proposals, explicitly likening them to the "disaster" of former Prime Minister Liz Truss's policies. Burnham, who has recently floated a rival economic vision including a 50p top income tax rate, is facing renewed speculation about his leadership ambitions. Starmer underscored his government's unwavering commitment to fiscal rules, arguing that abandoning them for either tax cuts or increased spending would similarly harm working people. This public disagreement highlights internal Labour Party tensions amidst ongoing economic challenges and ahead of the party's autumn conference.</p>

          <p>A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey indicates that shale oil executives are highly critical of President Trump's policies, asserting they are significantly hindering investment within the U.S. oil industry. Despite the administration's pro-fossil fuel stance, executives report that Trump's pursuit of lower crude prices, increased tariffs, and the resulting policy uncertainty have led nearly 80% of companies to delay investment decisions. Anonymous comments describe the shale business as "broken" and "gutted," warning of disappearing drilling.

A crucial element of the agreement involves a new algorithm, to be retrained solely on U.S. user data, with Oracle overseeing security and data hosting.

          <p>European leaders, including a hawkish shift from President Trump, are increasingly preparing for potential direct, though hopefully limited, conflict with Russia following a series of brazen airspace incursions into NATO territory. Recent incidents, such as Russian drones in Poland and manned fighter jets violating Estonian airspace, have significantly escalated tensions, prompting explicit warnings from NATO foreign ministers about shooting down any future intruding aircraft. This represents a notable departure from previous efforts to contain the war within Ukraine's borders. The growing consensus suggests that the risks associated with tolerating these provocations now outweigh the risks of a more assertive response, raising concerns about potential escalation.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve allegations of deceptively enrolling customers into its Prime membership program and hindering their attempts to cancel. This significant settlement, reached early in the trial, comprises a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds for an estimated 35 million affected customers. While Amazon maintains it committed no wrongdoing, the agreement mandates clear disclosures during enrollment and a simplified cancellation process for Prime memberships. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson lauded the outcome as a "monumental win," despite the fine being a small percentage of Amazon's valuation.</p>

          <h2>US New Car Sales See Unexpected Boost Amid Tariff and Price Hike Concerns</h2>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have received an unexpected boost, leading Cox Automotive to revise its 2025 sales forecast upward, as consumers are accelerating purchases driven by concerns over impending tariffs and higher prices. This "pull-ahead" in demand, notably for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of federal tax credits, has temporarily benefited the automotive industry. However, analysts predict a sales slowdown in the fourth quarter and into next year once these credits expire and increased tariff costs are fully reflected in pricing. While major automakers like General Motors and Toyota have gained market share, smaller brands such as Tesla and Nissan are experiencing declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CarMax shares experienced a significant 20% drop, reaching their lowest point in over five years, after the used auto retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. CEO Bill Nash characterized the quarter as "challenging," citing evolving market conditions, a "pull-ahead" in sales driven by tariff-related fears earlier in the year, and depreciation in its inventory fleet as key factors. The company recorded declines in both overall vehicle sales and net income compared to the prior year. This performance negatively affected other automotive retail stocks, as CarMax's results are often seen as an early barometer for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Jillian Lauren, married to Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, has been granted mental health diversion, allowing her to avoid jail time for an incident in which she shot at Los Angeles Police Department officers. The event occurred when LAPD officers, pursuing hit-and-run suspects, entered her backyard, and Lauren, armed with a handgun, opened fire after reportedly ignoring commands; she was subsequently wounded when officers returned fire. Prosecutors did not object to the diversion, which mandates that Lauren abstain from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and attend therapy. Successful compliance over two years will lead to the dismissal of all charges.</p>

While acknowledging animal testing's historical role in medical breakthroughs, proponents argue for more ethical and efficient scientific methods.
