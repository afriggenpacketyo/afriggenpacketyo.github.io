          <p>Donald Trump's administration is facing increasing challenges to its tariff policies, with a New York court blocking his signature trade policy and setting up a potential Supreme Court battle. Trump's plan to hike tariffs on the world, raise trillions of dollars, cut taxes, and lure manufacturers back to the US has been met with delays and exemptions. Market panic and warnings about the impact on Trump's voters have prompted the administration to backtrack on some tariffs. Despite these setbacks, Trump's trade advisor claims the administration will find other ways to impose tariffs if necessary, adding uncertainty for businesses navigating the global economy.

          <p>Following a knife attack in Hamburg, conflicting accounts flooded social media, calling into question reports of heroism. A Syrian teenager, Muhammad al-Muhammad, who helped stop the attack, became the center of a national conversation about immigration, with right-wing media narratives manipulating images of him.

While the movement aims to reshape the European project with its own brand of conservativism, it has faced setbacks in recent elections, and mainstream European conservatives remain distant.</p>

          <p>An inquiry is underway in Australia to examine how Joel Cauchi, a man with a long history of mental illness, was able to kill six people in a mass stabbing at a Sydney shopping center. The inquiry is scrutinizing interactions Cauchi had with police and mental health professionals in the years leading up to the attack. Families of the victims gave emotional testimonies, describing the horror of learning about their loved ones' deaths through media reports and the pain of seeing images of the scene.</p>
