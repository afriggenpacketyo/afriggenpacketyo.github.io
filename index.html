          <p>The Trump administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to large protests following ICE operations, leading to clashes between protesters and authorities. California's Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Mayor Bass stated city officials were working with law enforcement to find a path forward. The deployment invokes Title 10 authority, a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act, allowing military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The protests erupted after ICE conducted raids in several L.A. districts, resulting in numerous arrests and prompting strong reactions from both officials and community leaders, with some decrying the federal government's actions as sowing chaos. The event has caused heightened tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on halving the time required to apply for citizenship, a move that has polarized the country. The proposal aims to reduce the waiting period from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations. While civil society groups support the referendum, Prime Minister Meloni opposes it, calling the current citizenship law already "excellent." The reform would affect long-term foreign residents employed in Italy and their children, potentially granting citizenship to up to 1.4 million people, but the vote requires a 50% voter turnout to be valid.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that the UK's plans to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal, as outlined in the 2025 strategic defence review (SDR), undermine international non-proliferation efforts. The decision will likely fuel a global nuclear arms race led by the US, China, and Russia, increasing the risk of deploying tactical nukes in conflict zones. This policy, according to Tisdall, is redundant, immoral, and perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power. He urges gradual disarmament as the only way to escape the nightmare of nuclear warfare, criticizing the government's PR campaign to justify its nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <p>According to Ben Rhodes, President Trump has reportedly more than doubled his personal wealth since starting his 2024 election campaign, with billions of foreign dollars flowing into his family's ventures. This situation is raising concerns that the political system is being transformed to serve the leader's personal interests. The piece draws parallels to leaders like Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban, who have allegedly used their positions to enrich themselves and their associates. It highlights fears that checks and balances are being weakened, eroding moral and ethical frameworks within the government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has seized the opportunity to deploy federal force in California, ordering 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles. This decision, made without consulting California's Governor Newsom, has been criticized as an overreach of federal power. Newsom accused the White House of "sowing chaos" and escalating tensions, while Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to mobilize active-duty Marines. The move comes amidst protests over immigration enforcement, with Trump claiming the need to solve a problem that local authorities say is under control.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the decline in fertility rates particularly urgent. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>
