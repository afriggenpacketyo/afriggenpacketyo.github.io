          <p>Several airlines, including Delta and United, have suspended flights to Tel Aviv, Israel, after Israel conducted missile strikes on Iran which led to the closure of airspace in the Middle East. Delta has suspended service through August 31, while United has halted Tel Aviv services through at least Saturday. El Al, an Israeli airline, has also suspended service and warned customers against going to Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. These disruptions follow heightened tensions in the region due to the Israeli strikes and subsequent Iranian aerial response. Optimism is low due to international tensions and travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>According to a source, the United States had advance notice of Israeli strikes against Iran, which targeted the country's nuclear program and military leaders. Israel launched dozens of strikes, resulting in the deaths of several nuclear scientists and high-ranking military officials, according to Israeli officials. Iran responded with an aerial attack involving about 100 drones, all of which Israel claims to have shot down. A U.S. official stated that the U.S. did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike. The strikes and counter-strikes have heightened tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Christy Walton, a Walmart heiress, placed an ad in The New York Times promoting a "No Kings" protest against President Trump, leading to calls for a boycott of Walmart. The company has distanced itself from the ad, stating that Walton does not serve on the board or play any role in decision-making at Walmart. The ad urges people to participate in the protest scheduled for June 14, coinciding with a military parade in Washington, D.C. Trump supporters are now urging shoppers to boycott Walmart in response to Walton's actions, which are viewed as a political statement against the administration.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back to the U.S. from detention in El Salvador. He is accused of participating in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America within the U.S. The prosecution presented Homeland Security special agent Pete Joseph, who testified about a 2022 traffic stop involving Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue that the government's arguments for detention are meritless and that he is not a flight risk, citing a 2019 court order barring his deportation to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Marine experts believe they may have found the remains of the Recovery, a British ship that sank off the coast of Wexford, Ireland, in 1787. The ship was carrying a treasure of marble, bronze, art, and natural curiosities collected by James Caulfeild and John La Touche. Underwater archaeologists found a copper sheath, a 20-foot-long rudder, timber, an anchor, and artifacts including a teapot and inkwells. The true value of the cargo is unknown, but La Touche's possessions have previously sold for significant sums, suggesting the shipwreck could contain valuable items.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump lost his bid for an appeals court rehearing in the E. Jean Carroll case, where he was found liable for sexual assault and defamation. The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected Trump's request for a full bench rehearing, upholding the 2023 verdict that ordered him to pay Carroll $5 million in damages. Two judges, both nominated by Trump, dissented from the decision. Trump's legal team indicated they may appeal to the Supreme Court.

The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers reported across-the-board gains, with the headline index rising to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month. This improvement coincided with a decrease in heated rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and progress in global trade negotiations, especially with China. Consumers still perceive downside risks to the economy, but fears about the potential impact of tariffs on future inflation have lessened.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has improved more than expected in June, driven by President Trump's rollback of some tariffs. The University of Michigan survey data indicates a resurgence in shopper attitudes, ending six consecutive months of decline. Year-ahead inflation expectations have also dropped sharply, reflecting optimism about the economy. The improvement in sentiment is seen across various demographics, including age, income, and political affiliation, suggesting a broad-based positive response to the easing of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, according to the Israeli military. The strikes focused on sites in Tehran and Natanz, a key uranium enrichment location, with over 200 fighter jets involved. In response, Iran launched more than 100 drones at Israel, many of which were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. The U.S. stated it was not involved in the Israeli strikes. The strikes and counter-strikes have escalated tensions in the region, with Iran vowing to take action against Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump's message on Iran appears inconsistent following Israel's attacks, as Republicans diverge over the appropriate response. While U.S. diplomats reacted coolly to the strikes, Trump commented on his Truth Social account, expressing a somber message to Iranian leadership. He told CNN that the U.S. "of course" supports Israel, but also stated that Iran had a second chance to agree to a deal. Analysts suggest that Israel's actions may have torpedoed nuclear talks, with the prospects for peace appearing dimmer. The U.S. still plans to hold scheduled talks with Iranian officials in Oman.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) report that most Americans can no longer afford a "minimal quality of life" due to wages failing to keep pace with rising costs. LISEP's "Minimal Quality of Life Index" considers not only essentials but also basic leisure and upward mobility costs. The bottom 60% of households fell short of this threshold in 2023, with real spending power decreasing by 4% on average from 2001 to 2023. Medical premiums, travel, rent, and the cost of raising children have significantly outpaced wage growth.</p>

Allergy expert Professor Stephen Till recommends a "cocktail approach" of antihistamine tablets or drops, a steroid nasal spray, and eye drops. Avoiding triggers and practicing good hygiene, such as showering and changing clothes after being outside, are also essential.</p>
