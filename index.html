          <p>The Trump administration is considering asking the Supreme Court to immediately pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs. This action comes after the U.S. Court of International Trade struck down his "reciprocal" tariffs, dealing a blow to his trade agenda. Top aides are criticizing the judges who issued the ruling, claiming judicial overreach and bias against the administration's trade policies. The administration is also seeking a temporary pause of the ruling's enforcement while the case is being appealed.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing conflict between Harvard University and the White House, trade schools may emerge as an unexpected beneficiary. President Trump has signaled his intention to divert funds from Harvard to financially support vocational training programs. This move reflects a shifting perspective on alternative career pathways amid rising college costs and student loan debt. While college enrollment is still climbing, community colleges are seeing significant gains, indicating a growing interest in shorter-term credentials at a lower cost.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a federal agency adequately considered the environmental impact of a proposed railway in Utah, limiting the scope of environmental reviews required by federal law. Justice Kavanaugh said lower courts have made environmental impact statements needlessly elaborate, hindering infrastructure development. Environmental groups expressed alarm, while Justice Sotomayor concurred on narrower grounds. The ruling stems from a challenge to a 3,600-page report on an 88-mile railway connecting oil fields to the national rail network.</p>

          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal, creating uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. The ruling halts tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), but the administration intends to appeal. Other tariffs imposed through different trade rules remain in effect. The effective tariff rate is now lower but still higher than before the Trump administration, adding to the economic complexities. Economists say most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025.</p>
