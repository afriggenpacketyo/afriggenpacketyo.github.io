          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Japanese officials to discuss the country's potential in AI development, citing its leadership in robotics and industrial manufacturing. Huang emphasized the critical need for increased energy production to fuel the energy-intensive demands of AI. He suggested Japan should invest in new infrastructure to support industrial growth and intelligence creation. Japan is currently balancing the energy demands of data centers with the complexities of restarting nuclear reactors and increasing fossil fuel imports.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the United States have resulted in a significant decrease in shipments, impacting US manufacturers reliant on these rare earths. The export reductions, imposed in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods, include declines in tellurium, tungsten, molybdenum, and bismuth. China holds a dominant position in the rare earth supply chain, giving it leverage in the ongoing trade war. This cutback is expected to put additional pressure on US industries that depend on these materials for various products, from smartphones to military equipment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar dropped below 140 yen for the first time in seven months after President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. Trump's remarks raised concerns about the central bank's independence, leading to the selling of the U.S. currency. The dollar also faced pressure due to speculation that the U.S. administration would urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance talks in Washington. The dollar fell to around 139.90 yen in Tokyo trading.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to publish data on the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the UK for the first time. The move comes after pressure from the Conservative party, who accused Labour of buckling on the issue. Official data shows over 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation, with the main nationalities being Albanians, Romanians, and Poles. The most common offenses include drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault.</p>

A weaker dollar can ease the debt burden for countries with dollar-denominated debts and lower inflation. However, it can also complicate export competitiveness and potentially lead to capital flight. Central banks are currently avoiding devaluation to prevent stoking price growth and monetary authorities are wary of inflation staying above their targets. (not investment advice)</p>
