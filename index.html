        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal authorities have arrested a Wisconsin judge and a former New Mexico judge for allegedly interfering with immigration enforcement efforts. Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest after a courtroom appearance. Former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano and his wife face charges related to allegedly harboring an undocumented immigrant with gang ties. These actions mark a significant escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S., drawing condemnation from critics who see it as an attack on judicial independence. Relevant context includes Trump's strict immigration policies and the debate over the role of local officials in federal enforcement.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people protested in Germany following the fatal police shooting of a 21-year-old Black man, Lorenz A., after an altercation outside a nightclub. Protesters are condemning what they perceive as structural racism within the police force, demanding a full investigation into the incident. Police claim the man sprayed security staff with pepper spray and threatened them with a knife before being shot. A coroner's examination revealed three gunshot wounds, including one in the back of the head, leading to heightened scrutiny and calls for addressing racism within law enforcement. The incident has also prompted Amnesty International Germany to call for addressing structural racism within the police force.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the DOJ will rescind a policy that allowed journalists to shield records and testimony related to suspects in criminal investigations involving leaks. Bondi argues that intentional leaks of sensitive information undermine national security and must be stopped. She claims the previous policy was abused, with officials using "media allies" to leak information for political gain, making their records untouchable. Critics, like Bruce D. Brown of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, emphasize the importance of protecting confidential sources. Bondi said the department will continue to limit the use of forced legal action to obtain information from the media.</p>

          <p>A group of Yale University classmates has penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to reconsider his role in the Trump administration, which they claim is transforming the U.S. into an authoritarian state. The letter accuses the administration of unconstitutional actions and undermining democratic principles, citing examples such as giving Elon Musk access to private data and attacking independent news media. Bessent responded, dismissing the letter as a campaign waged from behind a keyboard by close-minded progressives. This letter echoes a similar one sent to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in 2017, highlighting ongoing concerns about the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims to have saved billions in US government spending, but evidence supporting these claims is lacking. BBC Verify found that less than 40% of the claimed savings are broken down into individual savings, and only about half of those have supporting documentation. The agency has also made accounting errors, such as mistakenly claiming to have saved $8 billion from cancelling an $8 million contract. Experts caution against relying on maximum contract values to determine actual savings, as these figures often represent projected spending over several years.</p>

          <p>Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren are calling for an ethics investigation into President Donald Trump's planned dinner with top investors in his $TRUMP meme coin. The senators are concerned that this constitutes "pay to play" corruption, offering exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for investment. They cite reports of $TRUMP investors having ties to foreign exchanges and receiving funds from banned crypto platforms. The value of the coin surged after the announcement of the dinner, raising concerns about Trump and his family profiting from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

Former SBA head Isabel Guzman notes that small businesses lack the cash reserves and supply chain diversity of larger corporations.

The White House disputes the analysis, but the Partnership for Public Service argues that DOGE's cuts are creating waste.

          <p>FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on felony charges of interfering with immigration agents. Dugan is accused of sending federal agents away and allowing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican citizen, to leave through a non-public side door. This arrest is part of the Trump administration's crackdown on local officials who threaten progress on its deportation agenda. This case raises questions about the balance between federal immigration enforcement and local court procedures.</p>

          <p>Joseph Koenig has been found guilty of first-degree murder for throwing a rock through the windshield of Alexa Bartell's car, resulting in her death. Koenig was also found guilty on additional charges related to throwing rocks at other vehicles. Two co-defendants, Nicholas Karol-Chik and Zachary Kwak, pleaded guilty and testified against Koenig. Koenig's defense argued that his actions constituted manslaughter, not murder. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 3.</p>
