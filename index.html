          <p>A British woman, Alicia Kemp, has been charged in Perth, Australia, after allegedly hitting and killing Thanh Phan while riding an e-scooter under the influence of alcohol. Prosecutors allege that Kemp was speeding at 20-25km/h on a pavement when she struck Phan from behind, who died two days later from head injuries. Kemp was denied bail due to being a flight risk as she is on a working holiday visa, and faces charges of death by dangerous driving while under the influence, which carries a maximum 20-year prison term, and dangerous driving occasioning bodily harm for injuries to her passenger. The city council has suspended the use of hire e-scooters following the incident, and the police minister is reviewing e-scooter regulations.</p>

          <p>Following large-scale protests in Los Angeles sparked by ICE operations, the Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen.

California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities are capable of managing the situation. Meanwhile, federal officials have defended the immigration operations, asserting that they are targeting criminals and those in the country illegally, leading to heightened tensions and accusations of sowing terror within immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Japanese telecom giant NTT Docomo Inc. will retire its original set of emoji after 26 years, which played a key role in shaping digital communication. The company's Android smartphones and feature phones marketed from June will no longer include the Docomo emoji set. The firm stated that the emoji had "fulfilled their role," noting that Google's emoji had become more common globally, thus new mobile phones will adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead. NTT Docomo's set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024, Japan is reevaluating its disaster preparedness, with a focus on sanitation. The earthquake exposed the dire state of public restrooms, leading to unsanitary conditions and the term "toilet panic". Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets during disasters to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and ensure public health. Efforts are being made to educate elementary school students on how to use portable toilets, with the goal of preventing future sanitation crises during emergencies.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Some venture capitalists argue that embracing overwork is necessary for European startups to compete globally, however, many founders and VCs disagree, emphasizing the importance of sustainable innovation cultures and work-life balance. They argue that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through innovation rather than overwork, and that a focus on employee well-being is crucial for long-term success. Additionally, it is noted that startups need more funding and resources to compete effectively on the global stage.</p>

          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia, known as Sona or Tusona, is being rediscovered through a social media project by the Women's History Museum of Zambia. This system, used by the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, involves geometric patterns carrying mathematical principles and messages about nature and community life. Originally taught by women, Sona is now being revived to challenge colonial narratives that erased African knowledge systems. The project aims to highlight the role of women in pre-colonial Zambian society and reclaim cultural heritages.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to a California egg distributor, August Egg Company, has sickened 79 people across nine states, leading to a recall of 1.7 million dozen eggs. The recalled eggs were sold under various brand names and distributed to multiple retail locations, including Walmart. Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, and while most people recover within a week, it can be fatal in vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has exacerbated uncertainty over NASA's budget, which is facing deep cuts. The agency has published its budget request to Congress, which would see funding for science projects significantly reduced. The president has also threatened to withdraw federal contracts with Musk's company, SpaceX, which NASA relies on for resupplying the International Space Station. These developments are causing concern within the space science community, with potential impacts on long-term planning and international collaborations.</p>

This lack of a clear process has led to growing fears among relatives that their loved ones may be overlooked in any ceasefire agreements.

She plans to challenge the judgment at the European Court of Human Rights, asserting that the court did not hear from trans people before its ruling.
