          <h2>Free Speech Advocate Outlines Expectations for University Students</h2>

          <p>Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), emphasized that students should expect to encounter views they find shocking or offensive as part of their education. The OfS has published guidance for universities in England regarding a new law designed to protect free speech, which will come into force in August. Universities sought clarity after the University of Sussex was fined for policies that had a "chilling effect" on freedom of speech. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures to do so. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, aiming to ensure open discussion within legal boundaries. The director for free speech wants students to be able to express any view, no matter how offensive it is to others, as long as it is not outside what is generally allowed by law, such as harassment or unlawful discrimination.</p>

          <p>Communities across the U.S. are commemorating Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the end of slavery, through various events. Juneteenth, observed annually on June 19th, commemorates the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were officially freed. Celebrations range from small gatherings to large parades, art shows, and educational workshops. Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021 under the Biden administration, leading to increased public festivities. Many celebrations include elements that pay homage to the history of the holiday and acknowledge the ongoing fight for civil rights, with community events and educational opportunities.</p>

          <p>An amber heat health alert has been issued across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C for the first time this year. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of likely significant impacts on health and social care services, including increased demand. Temperatures are expected to range between 27C and 30C across east Wales, the Midlands, and East and South East England, with some areas near London reaching 31C. The alert system, working with the Met Office, focuses on health risks and includes four levels of warning. Rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure and a south-easterly wind drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, prompting advice from fire services and health organizations regarding water safety and precautions for vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Samsung is set to launch a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold6, to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo. These competitors have released thinner and lighter foldable devices, emphasizing the importance of slim designs to consumers. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, notes that thinness has become crucial for foldables as consumers are less willing to compromise on device thickness. Samsung's newest Galaxy Z series aims to be the thinnest, lightest, and most advanced foldable yet, with Honor planning a competing launch. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities suggests Apple plans to enter the folding iPhone market next year, indicating growing interest in this sector.</p>

          <p>Computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, known as the "godfather of AI," has launched LawZero, an organization dedicated to ensuring AI does not harm humanity. Bengio, increasingly concerned about AI's risks, aims to create a "Scientist AI" that will act as a guardrail, calculating the probability of harm from other AIs' actions and blocking risky ones. This initiative stems from concerns that autonomous AIs could escape human control and go rogue. Scientist AI would not have autonomy or goals, but would instead assess the morality and safety of actions based on human-provided specifications. Bengio emphasizes the importance of democratic processes in defining morality and ensuring AI's actions align with societal values.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is urging diplomatic negotiations to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict, amid speculation of potential UK involvement in US-led strikes. Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel has called for the UK to support the US if it attacks Iran, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey insists on the publication of any legal advice before committing to military action. Starmer emphasized the need to address Iran's nuclear program through negotiation rather than conflict, recognizing Israel's right to self-defense. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to meet with his US counterpart, while Iran's foreign minister has confirmed talks with UK, France, and Germany regarding its nuclear program.</p>

The decision comes as Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for now, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not be held on the same day in July.

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers, ruling that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental health. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and amounted to unjust physical restraint. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade. Masako Suzuki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, emphasized the ruling's significance in acknowledging the violation of international human rights. The Immigration Services Agency stated it would review the ruling, while the plaintiffs had also notified a U.N. expert panel, which found their detention arbitrary.</p>

          <p>With summer temperatures rising, the US is bracing for another hectic wildfire season, but federal fire crews are concerned about being underprepared due to budget and staff cuts. The Trump administration's changes have left agencies managing public lands with significant gaps in their workforce. There are fears that a new wildfire directive to consolidate federal firefighters will be rushed, adding uncertainty. Many areas have had a warm spring following a dry winter, increasing the risk of fires. The loss of support staff and scientific expertise is raising concerns about the ability to respond effectively to major fires, despite assurances from the USFS chief.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's vow to champion the First Amendment, critics argue that free speech rights are being eroded under his administration. Arrests, attempted deportations, and defunding of institutions critical of Trump's agenda have raised concerns. The deployment of national guard members and marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to control protests, has been criticized as stifling public dissent. Experts say the First Amendment is under attack in ways not seen since the Nixon presidency. Critics highlight a double standard where protests against the administration are met with suppression, while dissent from Trump's supporters is often tolerated.</p>

          <p>Estimates suggest that last weekend’s “No Kings” protests may have been among the largest single-day demonstrations in US history, with turnout calculated between four million and six million people. This could exceed the 2017 Women’s March, which saw between 3.3 million and 5.6 million participants. Organizers and attendees feel invigorated enough to continue the demonstrations, with another round of coordinated protests planned. Political scientists suggest the massive turnout could be a turning point, potentially triggering significant change. However, organizers acknowledge that sustained engagement beyond single-day protests is crucial for achieving long-term goals.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic argues that Democrats need to cultivate hobbies and interests outside of politics to better connect with a broader range of voters. The author notes that Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of political junkies, while Republicans are the party of people who would rather think about anything else. The article suggests that Democrats should emulate figures like Barack Obama, who displayed genuine interests outside of politics, and that they should engage with media that prioritizes fun over seriousness. The author proposes that Democrats should support channels that build audiences by being purely entertaining and then, on rare occasions, bring on candidates as guests.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic explores the trend of using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) among non-diabetic individuals, questioning their health benefits. While CGMs have revolutionized diabetes management, experts express skepticism about their value for those without the condition. The devices are marketed as tools to track blood sugar levels and motivate healthier choices. They have gained popularity in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement and among wellness influencers, with endorsements from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, scant research supports the claim that CGMs improve health for non-diabetics, and they may lead to unhealthy dietary choices.</p>

          <p>Mattel and OpenAI have announced a partnership to bring AI to age-appropriate play experiences, raising concerns about the impact of AI on children's development. A decade ago, Mattel released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond, but it was discontinued due to security vulnerabilities. AI-powered toys are not new, but this partnership brings renewed attention to the potential risks and benefits of integrating AI into play. While AI can be a powerful educational tool, some experts argue that children often prefer imagining on their own terms and that AI-powered toys may not be solving a particular problem.</p>

          <p>This article explores the origins of Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S., and its significance in American history. Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, marks the day in 1865 when the last group of enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. The holiday, officially recognized in 2021, is celebrated annually on June 19 with parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops. Juneteenth symbolizes independence and provides an opportunity to reflect on the country's foundation on centuries of slavery, and also highlights the ongoing need to address issues of equality and justice.</p>
