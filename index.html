          <p>Ten adult men remain at large after escaping from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a full-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendall Myles, has been apprehended in the French Quarter, while Gary Price, charged with attempted first-degree murder, is among those still at large. Officials believe the inmates likely had assistance and have changed out of their jail clothes, urging the public to remain alert and report any information to authorities.

Mexican officials argue the proposal would damage both nations' economies and amounts to double taxation, as migrants already pay taxes in the U.S. Representatives from the electronic payment transfer industry have also expressed concern that the proposal would harm vulnerable communities and drive consumers toward unregulated channels.

          <p>Republican leaders in Louisiana are advocating for the removal of remaining federal desegregation orders in their state, arguing that they are outdated and no longer necessary. They believe the era of racial exclusion is in the past, and the U.S. government has imposed burdensome requirements on school districts for too long. Civil rights advocates, however, view this effort as part of a broader attack on Black students and civil rights under the Trump administration, especially as U.S. schools are becoming more segregated. The Justice Department has already dismissed one order and is open to lifting others, sparking concerns about the future of school integration and racial equity.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering abandoning a deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to a felony charge related to the two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max plane, according to lawyers for the families of some of the 346 crash victims. Justice Department officials informed the families that they are considering reaching a non-prosecution agreement with Boeing instead, as Boeing has refused to plead guilty. Under such an agreement, Boeing would pay approximately $445 million to a crash victims’ fund, invest heavily in compliance and safety, and agree to oversight by an independent compliance consultant. This decision has been met with strong opposition from the victims' families.</p>

Trump Jr. disputes suggestions that he is cashing in on his father's name, asserting he is a private citizen who has been a businessman his entire life.

          <p>The Justice Department and Boeing are reportedly nearing a deal that would allow the aerospace giant to avoid pleading guilty or facing trial in a criminal case related to the two deadly crashes of its 737 Max passenger jet. Boeing had previously agreed to plead guilty in the case last summer, but a judge rejected that plea deal last year, raising concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion. The fraud charge stems from Boeing's development of the 737 Max, with the U.S. accusing the company of misleading regulators about its inclusion of a flight-control system implicated in the crashes.</p>

The article argues that Trump's approach seeks to create an immoral world order by favoring authoritarian regimes and criticizing democracies for policies like migration and hate speech laws. While corruption plays a role in Trump's international dealings, his preference for certain regimes suggests a value-based approach, albeit one that deviates from traditional American values.

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling aircraft, the 737 Max. The Department of Justice officials said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case, avoiding a trial over the criminal fraud charge. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims expressed "deep disappointment" with the new plan. Boeing agreed to plead guilty in the case last summer after the Biden administration found the company violated a 2021 agreement tied to the crashes.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve will reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, including offering deferred resignation to some older employees, according to a memo from central bank chair Jerome Powell. The move aims to consolidate functions, modernize business practices, and ensure the Fed is right-sized. The planned staff cuts come as the Trump administration has pushed for cost cuts across civil service agencies. One method for shrinking the staff will be to offer a voluntary deferred resignation program to employees of the Federal Reserve Board who would be fully eligible to retire at the end of 2027.</p>
