Lawmakers face a looming September 30 deadline to pass funding bills and avert a government shutdown, a task complicated by partisan disagreements over spending levels. Beyond the budget, the agenda includes confirming President Trump's nominees, a potential crime bill, and ongoing demands for the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, setting the stage for a chaotic legislative session.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of "endangering every American's health." In a New York Times op-ed, they criticized his recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other policy decisions, which they claim prioritize politics over science and public health. The unprecedented criticism from bipartisan former leaders has prompted calls for congressional oversight into the turmoil at the nation's top public health agency.</p>

          <p>In a departure from traditional "evacuate immediately" orders, the Los Angeles County Fire Chief has endorsed the idea of training residents to stay and defend their properties against wildfires. Chief Anthony Marrone stated that with proper training, equipment, and defensible space, homeowners can effectively prevent their houses from burning down. This shift in strategy acknowledges the reality that fire departments are often overwhelmed during major blazes and cannot protect every structure, empowering community brigades to help save their neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Nearly 25 years after the 9/11 attacks, new commercial airliners are finally being equipped with secondary cockpit barriers to improve flight deck security. The system, a retractable folding door, creates an additional protected space when the main cockpit door is open, preventing potential breaches. While a 2018 law mandated these barriers on all new aircraft, pilot associations are pushing for them to be retrofitted onto existing planes as well, citing dozens of hijacking attempts worldwide since 2001.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man in Houston, Texas, has been arrested and charged with murder for the fatal shooting of an 11-year-old boy. The child, Julian Guzman, was playing "ding-dong ditch" with his cousin when the homeowner allegedly waited for them and opened fire as they ran away, striking the boy in the back. Authorities stated that the circumstances of the shooting do not appear to support any claim of self-defense, highlighting a tragic escalation of a childhood prank into a deadly incident.</p>

          <p>Ryan Wesley Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has submitted a bizarre court motion ahead of his trial. In the filing, Routh, who is representing himself, challenges Trump to a round of golf, requests access to strippers, and uses derogatory language to refer to the former president. The strange document raises concerns about the defendant's conduct during the upcoming trial, where he faces charges for allegedly hiding near Trump's golf club with a rifle in a planned attack.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Trump Administration's National Guard Deployment in Los Angeles Was Illegal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 19:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that its deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law bars the use of the military for domestic policing except under specific circumstances, which the judge found were not met. The ruling concluded that the administration knowingly broke the law in an attempt to assert executive power, setting a significant legal precedent as similar deployments are being considered for other U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Amid a market decline driven by profit-taking in major tech stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised long-term investors to trust the quality of the companies they own. He attributed the downturn to typical September profit-taking by institutions and broader economic anxieties, rather than fundamental weaknesses in leading companies like Nvidia and Apple. Cramer suggested that such pullbacks are normal and encouraged viewers to hold onto their positions in strong growth stocks rather than reacting to a single day's negative performance.

          <p>The Green Party of England and Wales has elected Zack Polanski as its new leader in a landslide victory, signaling a potential shift in the party's political style and strategy. Polanski's blunt and digitally-savvy communication contrasts with the more traditional approach of his rivals, who represent the party's rural constituencies. His win positions the Greens as another force on the political left, potentially competing for voters with Jeremy Corbyn's new movement and challenging the Labour Party from a more radical flank.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has started deliberations in the historic trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of orchestrating a coup plot to unlawfully retain power after his 2022 election defeat.

The case represents a major test for Brazil's democratic institutions, with Bolsonaro facing a potential prison sentence of over 40 years if convicted.</p>
