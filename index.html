          <p>Labour peer and former journalist Lord David Lipsey has died at the age of 77.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to pass President Trump's significant spending bill after late-night negotiations secured the necessary Republican support. The legislation, which extends tax cuts from his first term while cutting social programs and reshaping renewable energy credits, faced a difficult path. Democrats have strongly opposed the bill, highlighting its potential to increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion and cause millions to lose health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill's passage marks a major legislative victory for the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite broader economic uncertainties. The unemployment rate also saw a slight decrease to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. This strong performance, detailed in the latest Labor Department report, suggests the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates for now. Economists note the market's sturdiness in the face of potential tariff impacts and slowing growth projections for later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American retail industry is reacting with cautious relief to a tentative trade deal with Vietnam that sets tariffs on imports at 20%. While this rate is double the current 10% duty, it is significantly lower than the 46% tariff President Trump had previously proposed, which caused considerable alarm among businesses. Many major retailers like Nike and Gap have increasingly relied on Vietnam to diversify their supply chains away from China. Executives remain concerned that the increased costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers, potentially dampening spending. (not investment advice)</p>

She expressed gratitude that Rodgers himself clarified in a 2024 biography that she was not responsible for the schism. Munn, who dated Rodgers from 2014 to 2017, drew parallels to how other female partners of famous athletes are often blamed for their on-field performance.</p>

          <p>Homeowners facing rising insurance costs can potentially lower their premiums by undertaking specific strategic renovations, according to insurance experts. Projects that reduce risk, such as full roof replacements with impact-resistant materials or upgrading electrical and plumbing systems, are often rewarded with discounts. Installing monitored security systems and storm shutters can also lead to savings by mitigating threats of theft, fire, and weather damage. Conversely, cosmetic upgrades like kitchen remodels or adding a swimming pool typically increase replacement costs and liability, and are unlikely to lower insurance rates.</p>

          <p>The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a powerful Hindu nationalist organization and ideological patron of India's ruling BJP party, is advocating for changes to the country's constitution. RSS leaders argue that the words "socialist" and "secular," added to the preamble in 1976, were illegitimate and represent unwanted Western concepts. They contend that "Hindutva" (Hindu nationalism) is the true guarantee of secularism and that anyone born in India is fundamentally Hindu. While the Supreme Court has upheld the current definitions, and the BJP lacks the parliamentary majority to amend the constitution, the debate signals a long-term push to redefine India's identity.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book reveals that former President Barack Obama expressed significant concern over Joe Biden's 2024 re-election campaign, telling Biden's senior staff, "Your campaign is a mess." The book, "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America," details a December 2023 lunch where Obama bluntly critiqued the campaign's structure and leadership. The account also highlights underlying tensions between the two camps, with some Biden loyalists resenting what they perceived as disrespect from Obama and his team. Biden ultimately heeded the advice, restructuring his campaign leadership in early 2024.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old American pilot, Ethan Guo, has been detained on an Antarctic island by Chilean authorities for allegedly filing a false flight plan. Guo was attempting to become the first person to fly a small Cessna solo to all seven continents, a journey intended to raise $1 million for cancer research. Authorities in Chile claim Guo's flight plan only indicated a local flight over Punta Arenas, but he instead flew to King George Island, an unauthorized landing in Chilean-claimed territory. The prosecutor stated the unauthorized flight violated multiple aeronautical codes and international rules governing access to Antarctica, posing safety risks.</p>

Branding the legislation an "immoral document," Jeffries used the extended time to criticize its deep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO projects could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance. He argued that the bill represents a Republican assault on the healthcare and well-being of everyday Americans, children, and seniors.

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for the first time in the Caribbean. While the drone vessel was not carrying drugs, authorities believe it was a trial run by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug trafficking cartel. The use of such unmanned technology reflects a growing sophistication among cartels, allowing them to conduct operations with greater stealth and without risking the capture of crew members. Manned narco subs have long been used to transport cocaine, but this seizure highlights a significant technological evolution in trafficking methods.</p>

          <p>In a court hearing, the lead prosecutor revealed key evidence against Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students to avoid the death penalty. The evidence included DNA from a Q-tip found in his family's trash that linked him to a knife sheath left at the crime scene, as well as extensive cell phone and surveillance data. The summary detailed how Kohberger, a criminal justice doctoral student, meticulously planned and covered up the attack. While the plea deal brings a resolution, the victims' families are divided on the outcome, and Kohberger's motive remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The BBC has instructed several senior staff members to step back from their roles in music and live events following a controversial Glastonbury performance by the punk duo Bob Vylan. The group led a chant of "death to the IDF" and made other derogatory comments during their set, which was streamed live on iPlayer. The BBC called the decision not to cut the live feed an "error of judgement" and apologized for broadcasting antisemitic content. In response, the corporation will no longer livestream any performances it deems "high risk" without a delay.</p>
