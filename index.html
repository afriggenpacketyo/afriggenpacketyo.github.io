          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China After Receiving U.S. Government Assurances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:09:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume selling its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after the U.S. government provided assurances that export licenses will be granted. This move reverses previous restrictions that had significantly impacted Nvidia's sales in the Chinese market. The decision follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang and is part of a broader, preliminary trade framework between the U.S. and China. The resumption of H20 shipments, along with new compliant chips being developed, is anticipated to be a major growth driver for the company.</p>

          <p>The murder trial has commenced for James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors are focusing on the defendant's internet search history, which allegedly includes queries for "undetectable poisons" made on a work computer. The defense had attempted to suppress this electronic evidence, but a judge denied the motion. The case highlights a story of a secret affair and a meticulously planned crime, with the admissibility of digital forensics and toxicology reports expected to be central to the trial.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:00:10 EDT</div>

          <p>Chinese aerospace company Space Pioneer announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based stress test, a significant milestone following a major setback last year. The test successfully simulated key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, using the rocket's nine-engine first stage. This achievement is crucial for the company's credibility after a 2024 static-fire test ended in the rocket unexpectedly lifting off and crashing. The test confirms the structural integrity of the rocket's tail section, which must endure immense forces during launch and landing for future reusability.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed the company's plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on constructing enormous AI data centers in the United States to advance its goal of developing "superintelligence." The first facility, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. These data centers are incredibly resource-intensive, requiring vast amounts of energy and water, which raises environmental concerns. The massive investment underscores Meta's commitment to leading the AI race, a move that has been met with a positive response from the stock market.</p>

          <p>A report from a UK commission on antisemitism, led by Lord John Mann, has called for significant changes to address rising anti-Jewish sentiment, particularly since the October 7th attacks. The report issues ten recommendations, including creating a standardized antisemitism training qualification and urging the NHS to tackle the issue within its services. It highlights that many Jewish employees and patients feel unsupported and recommends that Judaism be recognized as an ethnicity as well as a religion in all official contexts. The findings point to a systemic failure to apply the same protections to Jewish people as are afforded to other vulnerable groups.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial over a 2019 crash in Florida where a woman, Naibel Benavides, was killed by a Model S allegedly operating on Autopilot. The victim's family argues that the driver-assistance feature failed to warn the driver or apply the brakes, while Tesla contends the driver was distracted by his phone and is solely responsible. The trial is significant as most previous cases against the company have been settled or dismissed. The case will scrutinize the responsibilities of both the technology and the driver, bringing Tesla's safety claims and the limitations of its Autopilot system under intense legal examination.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States is unlikely to succeed in pressuring Japan and Australia to make public commitments regarding their potential actions in a conflict over Taiwan. According to experts in both the U.S. and mainland China, such a move would be politically sensitive and could escalate regional tensions. They interpret Washington's efforts as a tactic to amplify the "China threat" narrative, aiming to encourage allies to increase defense spending and military cooperation with the U.S. This strategy is seen as reflecting a potential weakening of U.S. confidence in its ability to manage the delicate geopolitical situation in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, terminating a long-standing agreement that had previously prevented anti-dumping duties. The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to protect U.S. farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and subsidized pricing from Mexican producers. The decision has been praised by the Florida Tomato Exchange but criticized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and some lawmakers, who warn of higher consumer prices for products like salsa and potential job losses in related industries. Mexico's government has called the tariff unfair, attributing its export success to product quality rather than unfair pricing.</p>

The strike, organized by activists and community leaders, demands an end to mass deportations in agricultural zones and a pathway to citizenship for essential food industry workers.

While these sounds are inaudible to humans, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a new field of research into how these acoustic signals might influence animal behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter, and even communication between plants.</p>

          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly contemplating resignation after a contentious meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The former right-wing podcaster and Secret Service agent has been at the center of a feud within the MAGA movement over the handling and public portrayal of the Epstein files. Bongino and Bondi, who both fueled conspiracy theories about a powerful client list, clashed after a Department of Justice memo concluded the list did not exist. The public infighting has reportedly displeased President Trump, making Bongino's position within the administration appear increasingly precarious.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court to deny an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued her prosecution was barred by a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement, but this claim was rejected by lower courts. The DOJ contends the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not grant Maxwell immunity from prosecution in New York. The government's brief argues that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary and that her role was not even known when the deal was made.</p>

The facility, Gabriel House, had its last onsite visit in October 2023, which found instances of non-compliance, primarily related to missing documentation for which a correction plan was required. A preliminary investigation suggests the fire was not intentionally set and was likely caused by an electrical or mechanical issue. The distinction of the facility as an assisted-living residence, rather than a nursing home, means it is subject to a different regulatory and inspection process.</p>
