          <p>Tech billionaire Orlando Bravo has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently in a "bubble," drawing parallels to the dotcom era. He cautioned that investors cannot justify valuing a company with $50 million in recurring revenue at $10 billion, calling it a managerially challenging prospect. However, Bravo distinguished the current situation from the past, noting that large, financially healthy corporations are now financing AI development, providing a more stable foundation than what was seen 25 years ago.

          <p>A blog post on The Wartburg Watch played a crucial role in exposing decades of child abuse by Robert Preston Morris, the founder of Gateway Church. The post featured survivor Cindy Clemishire, which led to national media attention and Morris's eventual guilty plea to five counts of lewd acts with a child. The blog's editor, Dee Parsons, compared the unfolding scandals in evangelical communities to the crisis the Catholic Church faced, highlighting the importance of survivors speaking out and communities protecting children from predators in positions of trust.</p>

          <p>The White House is exploring the possibility of denying back pay to certain furloughed federal employees once the government shutdown ends, a move that appears to contradict a 2019 law. A draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget suggests a legal argument for withholding payment, despite the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 guaranteeing compensation. This proposal is part of a broader pressure campaign by the administration to compel Democrats to approve a clean funding resolution without extensions for healthcare subsidies.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has advised investors to consider allocating up to 15% of their portfolios to gold, citing its role as an effective diversifier during economic uncertainty. He compared the current financial environment to the early 1970s, characterized by inflation and high government debt, which erodes confidence in traditional fiat currencies and debt instruments. Dalio argued that gold serves as a unique hedge against monetary debasement and geopolitical risks, as its value does not depend on another party's ability to pay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A youth-led protest movement in Morocco, known as GenZ 212, is organizing significant anti-government demonstrations demanding systemic reforms in health, education, and the judiciary. The movement operates with complete anonymity, using the online chat platform Discord to coordinate daily protests and make collective decisions through online voting. Organizers state that the platform provides security and a decentralized structure that has so far eluded police familiarity, allowing them to mobilize nearly a quarter of a million members while avoiding traditional leadership hierarchies that could be targeted by authorities.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Senator Dick Durbin engaged in a heated exchange regarding the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. Durbin questioned the rationale and secrecy behind the move, while Bondi accused him of hating President Trump more than he loved his city, asserting the deployment was necessary to protect residents. The confrontation highlights the deep political divisions over the use of federal forces in cities, with Illinois state and local leaders actively opposing the deployment.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case brought by a Colorado counselor challenging the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, which prohibits practices aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The central issue is whether the law regulates professional conduct, as the state argues, or unconstitutionally restricts free speech, as the counselor claims. Justices appeared to question Colorado's interpretation of its own law, raising concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination, and are weighing whether the ban unfairly censors conversations between therapists and young clients on personal identity issues.</p>

Unlike countries with national health insurance that can negotiate prices for their entire population, the U.S. market is divided among Medicare, Medicaid, and numerous private insurers. This structure, combined with a political reluctance to refuse coverage for any drug regardless of its cost-effectiveness, prevents the U.S. from leveraging its market size to secure lower prices, resulting in Americans paying significantly more.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration from deploying the Texas National Guard to the city. Pritzker condemned the move as an "authoritarian march" and an illegal effort to use service members as political pawns to create chaos. The legal action comes as members of the Texas National Guard were seen boarding a plane, though their exact arrival time in Chicago was unclear. The lawsuit argues the deployment violates the principle separating military from domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service in the UK has announced it will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss a terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap. The charge, which stemmed from Ó hAnnaidh allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, was thrown out due to a technical error regarding the timing of the prosecutor's consent. The CPS stated its belief that an important point of law needs to be clarified by the appeal, seeking to reinstate the case against the controversial musician.</p>

The exchange occurred after the Supreme Court rejected Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence, and Trump, when asked about a pardon, said he would have to "take a look at it."</p>

With 80% of British steel exports going to the EU, the new tariffs could be devastating for UK producers. The EU's proposal is designed to protect its own industry from a glut of cheap steel, particularly from China, and to create leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As global cocoa prices have skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa, candy manufacturers are releasing new Halloween treats that contain less chocolate. New versions of popular candies like Kit Kats, M&M's, and Hershey's Kisses are featuring alternative flavors such as cinnamon, pumpkin spice, and berry-flavored creams instead of traditional chocolate coatings. This trend, along with "shrinkflation," appears to be a strategy for companies to manage rising costs while still marketing new products to consumers, as non-chocolate gummies and chewy candies also grow in popularity.</p>
