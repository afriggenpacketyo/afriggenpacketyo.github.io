        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump Coins, a venture launched by President Trump, attributes rising gold prices to Trump's economic policies, but experts disagree, citing economic uncertainty as the primary driver. They argue that gold typically rises during financial turmoil, such as trade wars or anticipated inflation, and that Trump's policies have shaken confidence in the dollar and Treasury bonds. The marketing email from Trump Coins suggests that Trump's return to the spotlight is reigniting belief in real value, but financial analysts link the rising gold prices to instability.

While the Trump administration acknowledges a potential "detox period," Apollo's predictions are more pessimistic, with tariffs on Chinese goods reaching 145%.

The judge imposed the maximum sentence of 87 months, ordering Santos to report to prison by July 25, after federal prosecutors detailed how he defrauded voters and donors. Santos, who pleaded guilty to two counts last August, expressed his belief that the sentence was politically motivated and hoped for a pardon from President Trump.

The Trump administration has previously attempted to withhold funding from sanctuary cities, but these efforts have often been blocked in court.

          <p>A Chinese student was airlifted from Mount Fuji for a second time after returning to retrieve his cell phone. The 27-year-old had initially been rescued due to altitude sickness but went back to the mountain to find his belongings, only to require another rescue. The incident has sparked debate about the risks of off-season climbing and the potential costs associated with rescues. Authorities are urging climbers to exercise caution due to the mountain's challenging conditions, particularly during the off-season.</p>
