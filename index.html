        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced an immediate halt to issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers, citing concerns over road safety and the economic well-being of American truckers. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the increasing presence of foreign drivers endangers lives and undercuts domestic livelihoods, prompting a comprehensive review of screening and vetting protocols. This action, which applies to all nationalities, occurs amidst a reported shortage of approximately 60,000 truck drivers in the U.S. The American Trucking Association supports this scrutiny, particularly regarding entry-level driver training standards. Concurrently, the Trump administration is reviewing over 55 million existing U.S. visas for any violations that could lead to deportation, emphasizing continuous vetting.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to showcase new land, sea, and air-based strategic heavy weapons at its upcoming Victory Day military parade on September 3, commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II's end. Wu Zeke, deputy director of the parade leadership office, confirmed that a significant portion of these domestically made systems, representing the nuclear triad, will be displayed publicly for the first time. The nuclear triad concept is crucial for maintaining a retaliatory "second-strike" capability, ensuring national security even if one or two delivery systems are destroyed in an initial attack. This grand event in central Beijing is anticipated to be the largest military parade of its kind, serving as a powerful demonstration of China's advancing defense capabilities and national strength.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified its previous order concerning Delhi's estimated one million stray dogs, now stipulating that non-aggressive, non-infected canines should be released after being vaccinated and sterilized. This revision came after significant protests and legal challenges from animal welfare groups, who advocated for more humane solutions than mass sheltering. The court, however, affirmed that dogs exhibiting rabies or aggressive behavior must be immunized and confined to shelters. Furthermore, the ruling prohibits feeding stray dogs in public areas, directing that dedicated spaces be established for this activity, and announced plans to formulate a national policy on stray dogs after hearing similar cases across states.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian newspaper, which had published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment found the meaning of each of the newspaper's articles to be "substantially true," and Mrs. Justice Steyn explicitly stated that she found Clarke "not a credible or reliable witness." The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision, describing it as "a deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a landmark for investigative journalism, encouraging other women in similar situations to speak out.</p>

This latest threat follows previous actions by Trump, including an order directing the mayor to provide Metropolitan Police services for federal purposes and mobilizing the National Guard to address the city's crime problem. Trump has repeatedly called for federal control of D.C. due to perceived high crime rates.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has expressed frustration over the ongoing transfer saga involving striker Alexander Isak, describing the situation as a "lose-lose." Isak, who reportedly desires a move to Liverpool, released a statement alleging that Newcastle broke promises regarding his potential departure if a major club made an appropriate offer. Newcastle had previously rejected a substantial £110m bid from Liverpool earlier this month. The 25-year-old Swedish international is currently training separately from the first team and will miss upcoming matches, including the game against Liverpool, with his future before the September 1st transfer window closure remaining highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>Canada is being compelled to fundamentally rethink its national defense strategy in light of the second Trump administration, which is perceived as a potential threat across its largely undefended border. The article highlights Canada's historical reliance on the U.S. for protection and its traditional focus on peacekeeping rather than robust military defense. Experts suggest Canada is currently ill-prepared for potential aggression, advocating for a "whole society defense" model, drawing inspiration from Finland's approach. This strategy would involve widespread societal mobilization and increased military spending, aiming to make any potential conquest too costly for an aggressor, and serving as a unifying force in an increasingly chaotic global environment.</p>

          <p>As measles cases rise across the U.S., the recently concluded Texas outbreak offers crucial lessons for public health officials facing similar challenges. Experts emphasize the need for more detailed county-level vaccination data and accessible, community-led vaccination campaigns, particularly in undervaccinated communities where anti-vaccine beliefs are becoming more prominent. During the Texas outbreak, officials navigated obstacles, including a CDC gag order, but successfully contained the spread by studying past outbreaks and implementing mass vaccination clinics.

          <p>The Trump administration has unilaterally terminated union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers after a federal appeals court overruled an injunction that had temporarily halted the plans. Union leaders, including Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), warn that these actions are a "test bed" for dismantling labor organizations nationwide, calling it a "fight for the very democracy of this country." Contracts at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, and Agriculture have been affected, impacting an estimated 400,000 workers. The administration asserts its lawful executive authority to eliminate collective bargaining agreements in agencies engaged in national security functions, despite ongoing litigation and strong opposition from labor groups who fear a degradation of worker rights and public services.</p>

Rallying outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, groups like the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy call for 50,000 new housing units, a prohibition on Airbnb and other short-term rentals, and safeguards for immigrant workers from federal raids. Unions argue that major sporting events often fail to provide lasting benefits for host cities, frequently leading to price increases that displace low-income residents and leave communities indebted. Olympic organizers, however, maintain that the Games will create good-paying jobs and positive economic impact for the region.</p>

Baron connects this "Mars craze" to the era's theory of evolution, tabloid journalism, and early science fiction by H.G. Wells. The review praises Baron's clarity and narrative drive, examining why people choose to believe, even when scientific method falters, and the lasting impact of this imaginative pursuit on space exploration.</p>

The article asserts that tariffs are narrow, arbitrary, unstable, and regressive, disproportionately taxing capital inputs and investment rather than consumption. It also points out that tariffs invite political carve-outs and favoritism, drastically narrowing the tax base. Ultimately, the analysis concludes that tariffs cannot realistically replace significant income tax revenues and risk undermining American prosperity rather than bolstering it.

While commonly associated with the devastating Black Death of the 14th century, the disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is now rare but treatable with antibiotics if caught early. Primarily affecting small animals and rodents in the U.S., human contraction usually occurs via infected flea bites or contact with infected rodents, particularly in rural areas like national forests. Despite significant medical advancements, eradication remains challenging as the bacterium persists in mammalian populations.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of humanity's greatest companies, calling buying its stock "very smart." These remarks were made during a visit to Taiwan, where Huang was thanking TSMC for work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin. His comments come as the U.S. administration has signaled interest in acquiring equity stakes in tech companies, particularly those receiving CHIPS Act funding like TSMC, which was promised $6.6 billion for Arizona plants. Despite reports of the U.S. considering such stakes, a government official later denied plans to seek shares in firms increasing U.S. investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chocolate lovers should brace for continued price increases due to a lag effect from soaring cocoa prices, driven by adverse weather, pest outbreaks, and supply tightness in West Africa. Cocoa futures hit record highs in late 2024, and chocolatiers are still passing these heightened costs onto consumers, contributing to significant retail price inflation. While cocoa prices have eased slightly this year, the ongoing market deficit suggests that elevated prices will persist for longer. However, J.P. Morgan analysts anticipate a potentially brighter outlook by next Easter, as industrial demand softens and supply improves from new plantings, though cocoa prices are expected to remain structurally higher long-term.

          <p>Efforts to rename a Berlin street, Mohrenstraße, after Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to receive a doctorate in Europe, have been halted again by a court injunction. The article explains that the name "Mohrenstraße" is widely considered racist, originating from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as "court moors." Despite district council approval in 2020 and a recent higher administrative court decision upholding the name change, a lawsuit from the citizens' initiative "Pro Mohrenstraße" has temporarily blocked the official unveiling. This ongoing legal and social struggle highlights the complex and often contentious process of decolonizing public spaces and recognizing Black history in Germany.</p>

          <p>A UN-backed agency, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), has officially confirmed that famine is occurring in Gaza Governorate, with projections of it spreading to other areas. The article highlights that over half a million people are at risk of starvation, with child malnutrition rates doubling since May. The IPC report explicitly states this famine is "entirely man-made," resulting from "deliberate restrictions on aid, the destruction of Gaza's food, health, and water systems, and relentless bombardment." Israel has rejected the findings, calling them "false and biased," while international organizations accuse Israel of "weaponizing" aid. The confirmation comes amidst renewed military operations in Gaza City and ongoing ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption surged to a record high in July, surpassing the 1 trillion kilowatt-hour mark, a level equivalent to the annual usage of all Asean nations combined. The article attributes this significant 8.6% year-on-year increase primarily to scorching heatwaves experienced across the country, which drove up demand. Electricity use in the primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, recorded the fastest growth at 20.2%. This substantial surge in power demand occurred even as overall industrial output growth slowed compared to the previous month, underscoring the profound impact of environmental factors on the nation's energy needs.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation (lese majeste) charge, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the witnesses and evidence too weak for conviction, noting the prosecution's account of his remarks was incomplete and potentially influenced by political bias against Thaksin. This acquittal marks a significant legal victory for the 76-year-old, who returned from exile in 2023 and has maintained a high public profile despite facing other corruption and abuse of power charges. The case highlights the controversial nature of Thailand's lese majeste law and the ongoing political tensions within the country's establishment.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a high-profile speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as the central bank considers its first interest rate cut of 2025 amidst significant political pressure from President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to lower interest rates to boost economic performance and reduce government debt interest payments, even calling for a Fed Governor's resignation. Policymakers face a dilemma: raising rates to counter potential tariff-induced inflation risks tipping the economy into a downturn, while lowering them to stimulate the economy could worsen inflation. Powell is expected to address these complex challenges and reaffirm the Federal Reserve's crucial political independence in his remarks. (not investment advice)</p>

He believes this step would signal solidarity with Palestinians and contribute to momentum ahead of the UN General Assembly in September, where France, Canada, and Australia are among those planning similar recognition. However, the German government has pushed back, stating that recognition is considered "one of the final steps" toward a two-state solution.</p>

Exports also edged lower, contributing to the economic downturn.
