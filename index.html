          <p>A man has been charged with stalking, attempted kidnapping, and aggravated criminal trespass after allegedly targeting Memphis Mayor Paul Young. According to police reports, the suspect, Trenton Abston, scaled a wall and knocked on the mayor's door. Authorities recovered a taser, gloves, rope, and duct tape from Abston's vehicle. Mayor Young expressed concern over the incident, linking it to the rise of angry online rhetoric and real-life violence, particularly in light of recent politically motivated shootings in Minnesota, and emphasized the need for caution and the prevention of political violence becoming normalized.</p>

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being transformed into a space for healing, art, and reparative history, with a focus on recentering the stories of Black descendant communities. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation is collaborating with a narrative studio to explore participatory forms of interpretation, inviting people to connect with the weight of the location on a deeper level. The initiative includes the creation of a site-specific sculpture memorializing "hush harbors," gathering places where enslaved people worshiped, and dialogue between descendants of enslavers and the enslaved. The new exhibit features everyday objects that tell the stories of three families of free people in post-Emancipation Alabama striving to make a place for themselves, fostering remembrance and reclamation.</p>

The flavor, inspired by the late father's recipe of Paula George from Sapulpa, Oklahoma, is made from butter, cheddar cheese, blue cheese, and bacon fat, among other ingredients. Chip lovers on Reddit have expressed mixed reactions, ranging from intrigue to hesitation, with some noting that the flavor tastes like a cheese chip.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, questions arise about the UK's potential role in the conflict. While the UK, along with other G7 allies, has called for de-escalation, its influence is limited due to strained relations with Israel and Israel's determination to act militarily against Iran's nuclear program. The UK possesses strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base and RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be involved in military operations. The UK also has a diplomatic role to play, working with European allies to engage with Iran, and the UK's military involvement would need to be purely defensive to comply with the law.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, possibly due to the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank. The explosion occurred during preparations for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines, causing a large fireball and scattering debris. The incident is under investigation, with SpaceX stating that safety protocols were followed and no personnel were harmed. NASA is counting on the Starship for its Artemis moon mission, and the explosion raises concerns about SpaceX's ability to meet the mission's timeline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from forcing Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted the states' request for an injunction, arguing the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage to coerce adherence to Trump's immigration agenda. The states contended the transportation secretary lacked authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. The ruling comes amid ongoing legal challenges to Trump's policies targeting sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip over plans to cut disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed understanding of the need to address the welfare bill but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. The government defends the reforms as fixing a broken system, ensuring those who can work should, and protecting those with severe disabilities. The bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, potentially facing a large rebellion from backbenchers.</p>

          <p>New ICE rules for members of Congress visiting detention centers are being criticized as illegal. Several members of Congress have been denied entry to immigrant detention facilities, sparking concerns about transparency and oversight. A federal statute states that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress from entering facilities for oversight purposes, but ICE guidelines request 72 hours' notice from lawmakers, which experts say violates congressional oversight powers. The Trump administration is accused of trying to hide the truth from the public, while ICE defends the guidelines as necessary for safety and security.</p>

While the odds of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection are low, they are greater than previously thought.</p>

          <p>The film “28 Years Later” is a reboot that is both a thrilling horror experience and a complex commentary on humanity. Directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, the film has a dull central plot beefed up by unusual ambition, quirky side characters and maniacal editing. The film is set nearly three decades into a viral “rage” pandemic that’s isolated the British Isles from the civilized world, and focuses on a family trying to survive. Ultimately, the film is a thought-provoking exploration of the nature of humanity and the lengths to which people will go to survive, however, this is just the first part of the trilogy.</p>

          <p>As President Trump considers military action against Iran, the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb and the B-2 Spirit bomber could be used to target the Fordo nuclear site. The MOP is designed to destroy deeply buried facilities, and the B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft equipped to carry it due to its weight. The B-2's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets. The potential use of these tools is controversial, with some suggesting it would be a provocative move.</p>
