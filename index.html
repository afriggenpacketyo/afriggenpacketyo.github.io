        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's latest 'Beige Book' report reveals that the U.S. economy experienced a slight contraction over the past six weeks, marked by slower hiring and increased economic uncertainty. Businesses and consumers are reportedly worried about rising prices due to tariffs, leading to cautious decision-making. Hiring remained largely unchanged across most of the Fed's districts, with many reporting flat employment levels amid a rise in job applicants. The report also indicates that prices are increasing at a moderate pace, with widespread expectations of faster cost increases in the future, largely attributed to higher tariff rates.

However, Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, states that F. graminearum is common in North America and causes crop diseases like Fusarium head blight. Farmers rely on fungicides to mitigate the risk, but scientists are concerned about potential mutations, and the FDA monitors toxins produced by the fungus to ensure food safety.</p>

          <p>Former Miami Marlins team president David Samson has criticized the Kansas City Royals' decision to call up their top prospect, Jac Caglianone, to the major leagues, calling it an "irresponsible" move due to service time implications. Samson argues that the Royals should have waited to call up Caglianone to delay his arbitration eligibility by a full year, potentially saving the team millions of dollars. He believes the decision puts added pressure on Caglianone to perform immediately and suggests the team is disregarding payroll considerations. Caglianone had a strong performance in the minor leagues, but went 0-for-5 in his MLB debut.</p>

Education Secretary Linda McMahon claims Columbia's leadership was indifferent to the harassment of Jewish students following the October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, aiming to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could harm steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliation from trade partners, and significantly raise costs for American users of the metals. The UK has been granted a carve-out, maintaining duties at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions with the U.S. Economists predict that the increased tariffs will lead to job losses in sectors such as manufacturing and construction, as prices rise for consumers.

The administration notified the university's accrediting body that federal agencies found the school violated Jewish students' civil rights. This action follows previous measures, including the cancellation of $400 million in federal funding. The administration alleges that Columbia failed to protect students from antisemitic harassment, leading to the accreditation threat.</p>

His criticism comes after departing from the Trump administration, where he headed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

          <p>President Trump's recent pardons, including those of former Republican politicians and individuals connected to his campaigns, have drawn criticism for being examples of "patronage pardoning." This practice involves reducing the expected penalty for loyalist misconduct by pardoning political allies. Critics argue that such pardons undermine the rule of law by signaling that loyalism will be protected and rewarded, potentially inducing criminal interference with official functions. The pardons are seen as part of a broader effort to treat law-enforcement institutions as tools of regime compliance.</p>
