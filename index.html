          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a drop in extended trading after the cybersecurity firm issued a revenue forecast that fell short of expectations. While the company's earnings per share surpassed estimates, revenue remained in line with projections, but costs rose in sales, marketing, research, and development, partly due to a past software outage. For the current quarter, CrowdStrike anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents to 84 cents on revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, which is slightly below analysts' expectations. Despite this, CrowdStrike increased its full-year earnings guidance while maintaining its revenue forecast and also authorized a $1 billion share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

Tensions between native populations and immigrants, coupled with authoritarian measures to suppress free speech, have created a volatile environment, making political violence more plausible.

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with legal action and potential fines over its policies regarding transgender athletes, specifically after a transgender student, AB Hernandez, won two high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, led by Harmeet Dhillon, argues that the California Interscholastic Foundation's (CIF) policies allowing transgender athletes to compete are unconstitutional, alleging sex discrimination against female students. President Trump echoed these sentiments, indicating that "large scale fines" would be imposed on the state. California officials have responded by stating their commitment to defending laws that protect students from discrimination, including transgender students. </p>

          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing an earlier image that drew comparisons to a mugshot. In the new photograph, Trump stares directly into the camera with a serious expression, wearing a blue suit and red tie against a dark backdrop. This contrasts with the previous portrait, which featured up-lighting and a more menacing stare. The new portrait also differs from Trump's first-term portrait, in which he smiled and wore a blue dotted tie. </p>

          <p>President Trump has formally requested Congress to rescind $1.1 billion in funding for public broadcasters, including NPR and PBS, for the next two years. This request is part of a larger package of proposed clawbacks that includes funding for foreign aid. Republicans have accused NPR and PBS of partisan bias, while Democrats have voiced strong support for maintaining financial subsidies. The rescission request represents an expansion of Trump's attacks on public broadcasting, and it has prompted a flurry of lobbying efforts. </p>
