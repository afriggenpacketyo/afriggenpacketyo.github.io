          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 04:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A severe and unusual frost in Turkey, the world's leading hazelnut producer, has significantly damaged the annual crop, causing prices to surge by over 35% since April. This shortage poses a major challenge for the confectionery industry, particularly for brands like Ferrero, which uses about a quarter of the global hazelnut supply for products like Nutella. While the company states it has diversified sourcing and does not expect supply disruptions, the market volatility may lead to higher prices for consumers or changes in product formulations. The event highlights the vulnerability of global food supply chains to climate change-related weather events.</p>

          <p>The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) issued a satirical memo targeting the Democratic "Project 2026" agenda, framing it as unpopular on topics like government spending, crime, and border security. This move came after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries missed a deadline to present a new Democratic platform. In response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) accused Republicans of creating a distraction from their own legislative failures and unpopular stances. The exchange underscores the intensifying messaging battle between the two parties as they approach the next midterm elections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's labor market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in job vacancies to 718,000 between May and July, the lowest level since early 2021. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a slight estimated decrease. Despite the slowdown, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, suggesting a gradual rather than sharp downturn. Economists note the cooling trend may influence the Bank of England's decisions on interest rates as it works to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The appointment follows the president's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring. Antoni has previously been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been supported by figures like Steve Bannon. The nomination has drawn sharp criticism from some economists who argue Antoni is an extreme partisan and lacks the necessary qualifications for the nonpartisan, technical role.

The agency cited the resort's "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023 as the reason for the truncated license. The CEO stated the resort is transforming into a premium lifestyle destination focused on experiences, with new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium already open. Future developments include a Super Nintendo World and a new luxury waterfront complex.</p>

          <p>With U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin set to meet for peace talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Russia cannot be trusted and is preparing for new military offensives. Zelenskyy stated that intelligence indicates Putin is not planning to end the war and that any meeting is a tactic to claim a personal victory before continuing hostilities. Ukrainian officials are concerned they will be sidelined from the negotiations and potentially forced to cede territory.

          <p>During a UN meeting, a diplomatic clash erupted between China and the United States over the Panama Canal. The U.S. ambassador expressed concerns about China's "outsized influence" over the canal's critical infrastructure, calling it a potential threat to global trade and security.

However, other research from the Israel Democracy Institute shows that a similar majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by reports of famine and suffering among Palestinians in Gaza. This indicates a public desire to end the conflict primarily for internal reasons, such as returning hostages, rather than out of concern for the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <h2>Spain's Foreign Policy on Defense and China Creates Friction with United States</h2>

          <p>Spain is creating tensions with the Trump administration through its distinct foreign policy choices, including renouncing U.S. aircraft purchases and pursuing closer economic ties with China. The Spanish government has resisted pressure to commit to NATO's 5% defense spending target and has preferred European military aircraft over American F-35s. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues. While President Trump has threatened trade repercussions, Spain's membership in the EU has so far shielded it from direct economic backlash.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals NHS Used Knee Implant Known to Be Faulty for Years</h2>

          <p>A BBC investigation has discovered that a specific NexGen knee implant component, used in thousands of UK operations, had a concerning failure rate that was known for eight years before it was withdrawn. Patients have reported severe pain, immobility, and addiction to painkillers after the implant slipped out of place, leading to hundreds of corrective surgeries. Surgeons state the US manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, was slow to acknowledge the problem, which was first flagged by the National Joint Registry in 2014. The company recalled unused implants in 2022, but the corrective procedures are expected to cost the NHS millions of pounds.</p>

          <p>During a trial for a lawsuit filed by California against the Trump administration, a high-ranking general testified about the controversial 2024 deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman stated he never heard the term "rebellion" used to describe the protests, a key justification the administration used for the federal deployment. The lawsuit argues that using military forces for domestic law enforcement violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The trial is examining whether the deployment was an illegal power grab or a necessary action to protect federal agents and property during protests against ICE operations.</p>

          <p>Miguel Uribe Turbay, a 39-year-old Colombian senator and presidential hopeful, has died two months after being shot multiple times at a campaign rally in Bogota. The attack, which recalled the country's past political violence, left him in an intensive care unit until his death. Uribe was a prominent conservative critic of the current leftist government and had recently announced his candidacy for the 2026 presidential election. While a teenage suspect was arrested at the scene, authorities have not yet determined who ordered the assassination or the motive behind it.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' lead in the National League West has narrowed to just one game following a 7-4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had one of his worst outings, giving up six runs in under five innings, including a first-pitch home run to Zach Neto. The Dodgers' offense struggled for most of the game, only showing signs of life with late home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy. The loss continues a period of frustrating, inconsistent play for the team, which has dropped to a 12-19 record since early July.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian firm, Wild Hornets, has developed a low-cost interceptor drone capable of reaching speeds up to 195 miles per hour, roughly as fast as a bullet train. The $2,500 first-person-view (FPV) drone, named the Sting, is designed to chase down and destroy the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions frequently used by Russia. High speed is critical for interceptors as they must catch the Shaheds, which fly at about 115 mph. This development is part of Ukraine's broader strategy to use innovative, low-cost technology to bolster its air defenses against overwhelming Russian drone attacks.</p>
