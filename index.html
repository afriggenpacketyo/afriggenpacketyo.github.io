          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors, allowing them to convert appreciated assets into shares of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to defer capital gains taxes. This method, which requires the contributed portfolio to meet specific diversification rules, seeds an ETF before its launch. While it offers significant tax advantages by rebalancing assets without incurring immediate gains, financial advisors caution that it can also limit an investor's future options, as their capital becomes tied to the specific ETF. Minimum investment thresholds for such conversions are typically high, often starting at $1 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel experienced a significant stock plunge, wiping out nearly $100 million in market value following the debut of a new, more modern logo. The updated design removes the familiar image of "Uncle Herschel," a man in overalls leaning on a barrel, which has been a staple of the brand's identity. This rebranding is part of a broader strategy by the company to refresh its image and menu to attract a contemporary audience. However, the move has drawn criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts, who argue the company is abandoning its cherished, traditional brand identity.</p>

          <p>Super Bowl champion Chris Canty has publicly expressed skepticism about quarterback Aaron Rodgers' ability to succeed with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Canty described the notion of Rodgers returning to his MVP form as a "hoax," citing the quarterback's age and recent injury history as significant concerns. He pointed to the Steelers' issues with their offensive line and the recent loss of a key running back as further challenges that will hinder Rodgers' performance. Canty also questioned Rodgers' commitment to the team, suggesting his recent comments about his future were self-serving rather than focused on winning a championship.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's sold-out concert residency in Puerto Rico has created a surge in business for local tattoo artists, as both residents and tourists seek permanent souvenirs inspired by his new album. Artists are using the increased demand as an opportunity to educate clients, particularly non-Puerto Ricans, about the cultural significance of popular designs like the maga flower and the coquí frog. This boom provides a vital economic boost during a typically slow season and allows artists to share the island's heritage. For many local business owners, it's a chance to foster a deeper respect for Puerto Rican culture amid challenging economic times.</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance visited Georgia to promote President Trump's recently signed domestic policy bill, emphasizing its significant tax cuts for families. During a speech at a manufacturing facility, Vance argued the legislation supports working Americans and criticized Georgia's Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff for voting against it. In response, Ossoff highlighted the law's negative impact on healthcare, citing a local hospital that faces a multi-million dollar budget shortfall due to the changes.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and has disqualified her from participating in ongoing criminal cases. The judge determined that the Trump administration's novel legal and personnel maneuvers to install her in the position were invalid after a 120-day deadline for interim appointments had expired. While the ruling does not automatically dismiss indictments approved by Habba, it declares her actions since July 1, 2025, to be without legal authority. The decision has been stayed to allow the administration an opportunity to appeal.</p>

Dunst, a veteran actress since childhood, recently starred in the critically and commercially successful film "Civil War," which became A24's second-highest-grossing movie. However, its earnings are dwarfed by the massive global success of "A Minecraft Movie," which grossed over $955 million worldwide.

          <p>Two senior House Democrats are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, questioning whether the companies conceded to "illegitimate demands" from President Trump to secure regulatory approval. The probe focuses on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Trump to resolve a lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe" in exchange for FCC approval of the merger. The representatives are requesting internal communications involving Trump, the White House, and the FCC, and have raised concerns about potential side deals and changes to CBS's editorial practices to align with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a multi-million dollar federal grant for a California sex education program because the state refused to remove references to gender identity, transgender, and nonbinary people from its curriculum. The Administration for Children and Families argued that such topics were outside the scope of the federally funded program, which aims to prevent teen pregnancy and STIs. California officials countered that the curriculum is medically accurate and legally sound. Advocates fear this action could set a precedent for defunding comprehensive sex education programs in other states that include LGBTQ+ inclusive content.</p>

          <p>A South Texas woman who was arrested on a murder charge in 2022 for using an abortion pill has filed a lawsuit alleging Starr County officials violated her constitutional rights. Lizelle Gonzalez spent three days in jail before the charges were dropped, as Texas law does not criminalize a person for their own abortion. Her lawsuit claims the district attorney and sheriff pursued the case despite knowing her actions were not illegal, acting outside their legal authority. The case highlights the legal complexities and potential for wrongful prosecution following the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the implementation of strict state-level abortion bans.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary fine, which had grown to over $500 million, previously imposed on President Donald Trump and his company for civil business fraud. The court ruled that the penalty violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by overstating asset values to secure favorable financial terms. The nonmonetary sanctions imposed by the lower court, designed to curb the company's business practices, will also remain in place.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a probe into Tesla after discovering the company failed to report numerous crashes involving its automated driving systems in a timely manner. According to federal regulations, automakers must report such incidents within five days of becoming aware of them, but investigators found Tesla's reports were often delayed by months. The agency will now conduct an audit to determine the cause and scope of the delays and to ensure Tesla is in compliance with all reporting requirements. This investigation comes as Tesla aims to expand its autonomous vehicle operations, including a robotaxi service.</p>

          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed citing cost savings and smaller portions as their main motivations. This shift in consumer behavior comes as some diners cut back on eating out due to economic pressures, as reflected in recent sluggish sales reports from major fast-food chains. The simpler options and lower price points of kids' meals are proving to be an attractive alternative for budget-conscious adults. This trend highlights how consumers are adapting their spending habits in response to the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of data centers, driven by artificial intelligence and other technologies, is creating a soaring demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and HVAC technicians. However, the supply of these workers is shrinking as older generations retire and fewer young people enter the trades, leading to hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs. This labor shortage poses a significant challenge for industries competing for this talent, from data centers to manufacturing plants. To address the gap, some companies are turning to new technologies for efficiency, while trade unions are increasing recruitment efforts for apprenticeship programs.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising homeowners with high-interest mortgages to begin preparing for potential refinancing opportunities as rates have recently declined and a Federal Reserve rate cut could occur this fall.

Key steps include checking home equity and researching lenders in advance to capitalize on fluctuating interest rates. Being prepared allows homeowners to be opportunistic in a climate where mortgage rates can change rapidly. (not investment advice)</p>

This move follows a Florida Department of Transportation memo prohibiting "surface art" with social or political messages on public roads.

          <p>An analysis suggests that the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy doctrine is not isolationist but rather an interventionist approach of "America Everywhere," particularly in Europe. This new strategy involves actively supporting and interfering on behalf of European political parties that share the administration's nativist and nationalist ideologies. This represents a significant shift from the post-war transatlantic consensus, creating a relationship based on transactionalism and ideological alignment rather than shared democratic values. The article argues this change reflects a growing divergence between American and European worldviews, which will require a new, more pragmatic equilibrium between the continents.</p>
