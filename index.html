          <p>Germany's new center-right government has eliminated the 'turbo naturalization' policy that allowed highly integrated foreign nationals to become citizens in just three years. The standard waiting period will now revert to five years, though the option for dual citizenship remains. This policy reversal has sparked debate, with proponents arguing it corrects a misguided incentive, while opponents claim it hinders Germany's ability to attract desperately needed skilled workers by making citizenship more difficult to obtain.</p>

          <p>HSBC has made a proposal to privatize its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, in a deal valuing the Hong Kong lender at over $37 billion. The offer represents a significant 33% premium over Hang Seng's recent average share price, causing its stock to surge by over 25%. HSBC, which already owns about 63% of the bank, framed the move as a strategic investment to strengthen its presence in Hong Kong and unlock new growth, despite Hang Seng's recent struggles with bad loans tied to the real estate sector.

          <p>Following the expected ratification of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel and Hamas are preparing for the release of approximately 20 living hostages, which could occur as soon as Sunday or Monday. The agreement has been welcomed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who emphasized that ultimate sovereignty over Gaza belongs to a future Palestinian state. However, the deal faces internal opposition in Israel, with far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowing to vote against it, highlighting the political complexities surrounding the path to peace.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the landmark Israel-Hamas agreement credits direct U.S. presidential involvement for breaking the long-standing stalemate and achieving a significant diplomatic victory. The deal's first phase involves the release of hostages and an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza, bringing hope for an end to the two-year war. However, the article cautions that this is not a final peace deal, as critical long-term issues like Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza remain unresolved, posing substantial hurdles ahead.</p>

          <p>Germany's chancellor is set to host a high-stakes 'auto summit' with industry executives and unions to address a profound crisis in the nation's automotive sector. German carmakers are facing a 'polycrisis' of slowing electric vehicle sales, fierce competition from Chinese brands, high costs, and significant job losses. The talks will explore potential state support, including extending EV tax breaks and a controversial proposal to delay the EU's 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars to help the industry navigate its difficult transition.</p>
