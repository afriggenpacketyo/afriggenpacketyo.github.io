          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, is preparing for a critical World Cup warm-up match against France, viewing it as a key step towards their ultimate goal of winning the tournament. Wing Abby Dow described the team's journey as climbing 'Everest,' drawing inspiration from a talk by mountaineer Jo Bradshaw. The team is focused on learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over France, where they nearly let a significant lead slip. Despite a recent hand injury, Dow feels fully integrated with the team's expedition, ready for the intense atmosphere of playing in France and building resilience for the main event.</p>

The suspect was found deceased from a gunshot wound, which may have been self-inflicted, after exchanging fire with police. While no civilians were shot, the gunfire struck the CDC building, where a daycare was operating at the time, and prompted a campus-wide shelter-in-place order. The slain officer, David Rose, was remembered for his dedicated service and leaves behind a pregnant wife and two children.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has expanded to nearly 5,400 acres, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The blaze, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, is now partially contained, allowing some evacuation orders to be reduced to warnings. A firefighter sustained major injuries when their truck overturned on a hillside while battling the flames. Authorities urge continued vigilance as high temperatures persist, while also noting that favorable overnight weather has aided firefighting progress on this and other active wildfires across the state.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two future Hall of Fame pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer's Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong performances, but Kershaw was slightly better, allowing only one run over six innings despite giving up seven hits. Scherzer held the Dodgers scoreless until the fifth inning, when a Mookie Betts two-run homer broke the tie. The game showcased the enduring talent of two of baseball's most decorated pitchers, with Kershaw's resilience ultimately securing the win for his first-place team.</p>

          <p>A year after a catastrophic landfill avalanche in Kiteezi, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 200 homeless, residents are still living in fear and awaiting compensation. The disaster was triggered by a methane explosion at Kampala's overflowing municipal dump, which has since been officially closed. With Japanese assistance, authorities are working to secure the old site, but controversy surrounds the new landfill location in a protected forest reserve. The city's ambitious plans for modern waste processing and recycling remain unfunded, highlighting the immense challenges in managing the capital's 2,000 daily tons of garbage.</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctions targeting an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil are unlikely to derail ongoing free trade negotiations between the EU and India. Experts suggest the EU's move to sanction Nayara Energy, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, is largely symbolic and will have a minimal impact on India's economy. Paradoxically, a greater threat of high US tariffs on Indian goods may be pushing New Delhi to seek a more stable partnership with the EU. This dynamic could inadvertently benefit the EU by increasing India's motivation to finalize a trade agreement and diversify its economic partners.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its prestigious civil service summer internship program to exclusively accept applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, sparking a debate among students. The change aims to make the civil service more representative of society, with some students from working-class families praising the move for creating a more level playing field. However, other students, who also consider themselves from modest backgrounds but do not meet the strict new criteria based on parental occupation, feel unfairly excluded. They argue the policy is divisive and discourages a segment of aspiring public servants who now feel they are not considered 'working class enough.'</p>

Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize this material typically resulted in mixed-phase or impure samples. The Chinese team's achievement, published in the journal Nature, produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, confirming the material's macroscopic existence.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two raids targeting day laborers outside a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, prompting accusations that they are violating a recent court order. The order temporarily bars agents in the region from targeting people based on race, language, or location without reasonable suspicion. Advocacy groups confirmed ten people were detained and argue the raids are a clear violation of the judicial ruling. The Trump administration has appealed the order to the Supreme Court, while L.A. city officials are investigating whether the enforcement actions, including one dubbed 'Operation Trojan Horse,' are illegal.</p>

          <p>A fire that broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain has been successfully extinguished by firefighters. The city's mayor praised the rapid response, stating that their intervention 'averted a catastrophe.' The blaze reportedly started in a chapel within the Almanzor naves, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The monument, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was converted into a Christian cathedral in the 13th century and remains a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom hosted Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan that could add five GOP congressional seats. During a press event in Sacramento, Newsom vowed that California would 'nullify what happens in Texas' by pushing its own redistricting plan to favor Democrats if the Texas GOP proceeds. This move highlights an escalating national political battle over gerrymandering, with California Democrats framing their actions as a necessary defense against Republican efforts to rig future elections. The Texas lawmakers face threats of arrest and fines for breaking quorum.</p>

          <p>Almond growers in Central California are facing a massive rat infestation across more than 100,000 acres, causing significant economic damage. The rodents are damaging trees by burrowing in root zones, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation equipment, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. According to the Almond Board of California, the surging roof rat populations are spreading through irrigation canals. Farmers are employing various costly and labor-intensive control methods, while scientists advise targeted baiting and trapping programs to manage the widespread and destructive pest problem.</p>

The issue, which occurred Wednesday evening, led to widespread delays and left many passengers stranded on tarmacs.

United later announced the technology issue had been resolved but warned passengers to expect residual delays as the airline worked to restore its normal flight operations across the country.</p>

          <p>A Fremont man has been charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at over $216,000 from the UCLA library system in a scheme spanning multiple years. Federal investigators allege that Jeffrey Ying used fake aliases to check out valuable antique books, some dating to the 13th century, and returned 'dummy books' in their place. The scheme exploited a library system that did not require official ID for checkout and lacked thorough review upon return. Ying was arrested before an alleged attempt to flee to China, and authorities found blank manuscripts and fraudulent IDs in his hotel room.</p>

          <p>According to BTIG's chief market technician, the S&P 500 has broken through a key resistance level, signaling a potential 5% sell-off is imminent. The strategist suggests the benchmark index could fall back to the 6,100 mark, which previously acted as a price ceiling, before presenting a new buying opportunity for investors. Several factors contribute to this bearish outlook, including weakness in consumer-focused stocks, a historical late-summer lag for semiconductors, and the potential for credit spreads to widen. The analysis also notes that mega-cap tech stocks are seeing profit-taking despite strong earnings. (not investment advice)</p>
