          <p>A bomb exploded near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, killing one and injuring four, with the FBI labeling it an intentional act of terrorism. The explosion, which occurred outside American Reproductive Centers, caused damage across several blocks, shattering windows and damaging buildings, but clinic staff and stored materials remained safe. Authorities are investigating, with a person of interest identified, and are working to determine whether it was domestic or international terrorism. The incident has sparked political discussion regarding the politicization of in vitro fertilization in the context of reproductive rights debates. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK-EU summit is anticipated to pave the way for an agreement that could significantly reduce the impact of the Irish Sea border, aiming to reset post-Brexit relations. The expected "agreement to agree" on trade issues, particularly in agri-food products, could lead to fewer checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. One Belfast food business expressed the urgent need for these changes to alleviate struggles with importing products from GB. However, the agreement's scope remains uncertain, and it may not completely eliminate the sea border, with some unionists viewing it as undermining Northern Ireland's place in the UK. </p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent engaged with hackers claiming responsibility for cyber attacks on M&S and Co-op, who shared evidence of stolen customer and employee data. The hackers, linked to a cyber crime service called DragonForce, expressed frustration over Co-op's refusal to meet their ransom demands. Co-op acknowledged a significant data breach after initially downplaying the attack, and the hackers revealed that the retailer narrowly avoided a more severe hack. DragonForce, operating as a ransomware-as-a-service, offers cyber criminal affiliates tools and support in exchange for a cut of ransoms, and this article elucidates their power struggle within the cyber crime ecosystem. </p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove indicated that a second Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is overwhelming public support for it. Gove, who oversaw relations between the UK and Scottish governments, cautioned against complacency and emphasized the need to demonstrate the union's effectiveness. His remarks align with SNP leader John Swinney's call for "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the backing for the 1997 Scottish parliament referendum. Gove highlighted the importance of improving public services to influence the likelihood of another independence vote, yet also said that the UK government must have the power to veto any bills from Holyrood. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but restricted its use to older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This decision contrasts with the broader approvals of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, raising concerns about limited access for healthy individuals under 65. The FDA's decision also requires Novavax to conduct studies on potential heart conditions associated with the vaccine, which could cost tens of millions of dollars. Experts have expressed disappointment and confusion over the restrictions, suggesting political influence from vaccine skeptics and the potential to make vaccines less accessible. </p>

          <p>The UK and EU are preparing for their first bilateral summit since Brexit, aiming to reset relations amidst global concerns about Russia, China, and US foreign policy. Despite lingering difficulties and French hardball tactics, both sides recognize the need for closer cooperation on security, defense, and trade. Key announcements are expected, including a joint declaration on shared foreign policy priorities, an EU-UK security pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While the UK seeks closer economic ties, Labour's red lines and the rise of the Eurosceptic Reform Party constrain ambitions, and negotiations over fishing rights and defense contracts continue. </p>
