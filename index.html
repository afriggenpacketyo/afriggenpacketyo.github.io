          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal, successfully averting a potential trade war just before a looming tariff deadline. The agreement reportedly establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a lower rate than the 30% previously threatened by the Trump administration. As part of the pact, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in U.S. investments, marking a pivotal moment in transatlantic trade relations.</p>

          <p>This article posits that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent legislative actions, seen as gutting the independence of anti-corruption agencies, were influenced by a broader shift in US foreign policy. It argues that the Trump administration has actively dismantled American-led global anti-corruption initiatives, signaling to leaders worldwide that the pressure for good governance has significantly diminished. The piece concludes that this new paradigm, which tolerates and even shields kleptocracy, has created an environment where even a leader like Zelensky feels empowered to protect allies from scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly using QR codes in a tactic known as "quishing" to deceive individuals into visiting malicious websites or surrendering personal information. This scam involves placing fake QR code stickers on legitimate items like parking meters or in phishing emails, exploiting the public's trust and the code's ubiquity. The Federal Trade Commission and other agencies have issued public warnings about this low-effort, high-return method used by hackers to steal financial data and install malware onto devices.</p>

          <p>The process of preparing a Boeing 747-8 jet, which was donated by the Qatari royal family for presidential use, is now officially underway. This aircraft, valued at $400 million, is intended to serve as Air Force One while new official planes are constructed and will later be donated to the presidential library. The arrangement has drawn scrutiny and prompted calls for an investigation, as the U.S. Constitution restricts presidents from accepting valuable gifts from foreign governments without congressional consent.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Israel's New Aid Measures Seen as a Gesture to Condemning Allies</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a BBC analysis, Israel's recent announcement of aid airdrops and "tactical pauses" in Gaza is likely a gesture aimed at appeasing allies who have strongly condemned the region's starvation crisis. The article argues these measures are insufficient and that only an unrestricted, long-term ground operation can provide adequate relief. It highlights that aid professionals view airdrops as an inefficient and often dangerous last resort, reinforcing the view that the move is more about optics than effective humanitarian action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Discretionary sector is significantly underperforming in the stock market, reflecting a growing economic divide between high- and low-income households. While the broader S&P 500 reaches record highs, companies that cater to price-sensitive shoppers are facing significant headwinds, as evidenced by recent disappointing earnings from firms like Chipotle. Analysts suggest this points to a "K-shaped" economy, where affluent consumers continue to spend while lower-income individuals pull back, creating a challenging environment for many businesses.

          <p>The United States and China are anticipated to agree to another 90-day extension of their current tariff truce during trade negotiations in Stockholm, according to sources close to the talks. This move would prevent the imposition of new tariffs and avert an immediate escalation of the ongoing trade conflict between the two economic powers. While the extension signals a continued commitment to dialogue, insiders reportedly do not expect major breakthroughs on key structural issues like China's industrial overcapacity.

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros against a visiting Israeli cruise ship has ignited a fierce national debate over the conflict in Gaza and accusations of antisemitism. Approximately 300 demonstrators carrying Palestinian flags successfully prevented 1,600 passengers from disembarking, which prompted the ship to cancel its stop. The incident has exposed a deep divide in Greece, with some defending the protest as a political statement while government officials and others condemn it as harmful to tourism.</p>
