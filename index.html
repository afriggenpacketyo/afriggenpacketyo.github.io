          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:01:54 EDT</div>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. This growth, surpassing analyst expectations, was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction. Economists suggest this positive turn was partly due to businesses front-loading exports to get ahead of potential tariffs. Despite the encouraging figures, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year.

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI. However, he suggested that Tesla might hold a shareholder vote on whether the automaker should invest in xAI, following a previous informal poll where a majority of his followers supported the idea. This comes as Musk continues to integrate his various companies, such as merging xAI with social media platform X and planning to feature the Grok AI chatbot in Tesla vehicles.</p>

          <p>Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, has arrived in Kyiv for a week-long visit to discuss defense, security cooperation, and sanctions against Russia.

Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy's top aide, welcomed the visit, emphasizing the "peace through strength" approach and the importance of strengthening the U.S.-Ukraine partnership amid escalating Russian attacks.</p>

          <p>London Southend Airport has suspended all flights indefinitely after a plane crashed upon takeoff, erupting into what witnesses described as a "huge fireball." The aircraft, a Beech B200 Super King Air operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, reportedly banked sharply and inverted before hitting the ground. While the number of casualties has not been officially confirmed, the company stated it is supporting authorities in the investigation. Eyewitnesses described the pilots waving moments before the aircraft powered up for its unusually rapid and steep ascent, which ended tragically.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President JD Vance engaged in a public dispute over the Trump administration's immigration policies. The exchange began after Vance vacationed at Disneyland, prompting Newsom to post on X that families being separated by mass deportation efforts could not enjoy similar time together. The political jab occurred shortly after controversial ICE raids on California farms, which resulted in one death and the detention of hundreds of suspected undocumented immigrants. Vance responded to Newsom's post by simply thanking him for the well-wishes.</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to slow. He stated that the path for interest rates is "downward," citing that the UK economy is growing below its potential, which creates "slack" that helps reduce inflation. This statement comes as official figures show a decline in job vacancies to their lowest level since 2021 and an increase in people available for work. Economists widely anticipate a rate cut at the Bank's next meeting in August. (not investment advice)</p>

Imports also saw their first growth of the year, rising 1.1%, signaling a potential, albeit slight, pickup in domestic demand.

          <p>The volume of online abuse directed at Wimbledon players has increased nearly fourfold during the first half of the 2025 tournament compared to the same period in 2024. A monitoring system detected over 1,900 abusive posts, with data suggesting the three most targeted players were male. Players like Carlos Alcaraz and Amanda Anisimova have spoken out about the "cruel" and frightening nature of the messages they receive, particularly after losses. The All England Club is using an AI-powered service to monitor and report abusive content, warning perpetrators that they will face consequences.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are making major inroads in Norway, capturing a combined market share of approximately 10% in the world's most EV-friendly country. Brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG are competing effectively with Tesla and traditional European automakers, aided by competitive pricing and advanced technology. Unlike the U.S. and EU, Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, making it a key entry point and "laboratory" for these brands in Europe. Experts note that Norwegian consumers increasingly view Chinese EVs as high-quality, technologically sound options.</p>

He was joined by family and high-profile guests like Tom Brady and Rupert Murdoch to watch Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain. In a statement, Trump said he believes God saved him for the purpose of restoring the nation. The event also provided an opportunity for his administration to engage with Qatari officials, who are intermediaries in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, with envoy Steve Witkoff confirming he planned to meet with them.</p>

          <p>An undercover BBC Panorama investigation has revealed questionable practices at two of the UK's largest estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. The report found evidence that a Connells agent appeared to sideline a cash buyer in favor of one who agreed to use the company's in-house mortgage services, a deal potentially worth £10,000 to the firm. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that staff were incentivized to overvalue properties to secure listings and then pressure sellers into price reductions. Both companies have stated they are committed to fair practices and have updated policies.</p>

          <p>A woman has been found to have illegally brought a baby into the UK from Nigeria using a fabricated story of her own pregnancy and birth. After claiming to be pregnant despite medical tests showing otherwise, she traveled to Nigeria and returned with an infant, whom DNA tests proved was not related to her or her husband. A Family Court investigation uncovered forged hospital documents and text messages suggesting a deal to purchase the baby. The case highlights what experts call a worrying trend of child trafficking, sometimes from illegal "baby factories" in West Africa.</p>

This violence highlights the fragile state of the country following the collapse of the Assad regime, as different minority groups face escalating conflicts.
