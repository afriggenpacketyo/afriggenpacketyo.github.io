          <p>China's export growth missed estimates in May, with a sharp decline in shipments to the U.S. offsetting gains in Southeast Asia and Europe. Exports rose 4.8% year-on-year, below the expected 5%, while imports plunged 3.4%, reflecting weak domestic demand. The U.S. and China had reached a preliminary trade deal, but tensions remain over critical minerals and export restrictions, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to meet with U.S. trade representatives in London for further talks. The data highlights ongoing challenges for China's economy amid trade disputes and the need for stronger domestic consumption (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, declining 0.1% year-on-year, indicating persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic demand. The automotive industry's price war and falling property prices contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices, despite government stimulus measures. Factory-gate prices also deepened, falling 3.3%, while core inflation rose slightly to 0.6%. Experts emphasize the need for more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption as trade tensions with the U.S. add to economic challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticized President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it an overreach of power based on false pretenses. The editorial argues that local law enforcement was managing protests effectively, and Governor Newsom opposed the deployment, deeming it "purposefully inflammatory." The board points out that the action is historically unusual, as National Guard deployments typically occur at the request of state leaders during emergencies, and argues that Trump's invocation of a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code is unjustified.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, comparing his actions to those of a "dictator."

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in disagreement over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, centering on interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump deployed the National Guard in response to attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, while Newsom argues the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions. The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist, including congressional decree or the inability of state governments to maintain order. The debate highlights the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policy.</p>
