          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced the company's plans to re-enter the cryptocurrency investing market following a shift in the regulatory environment under the Trump administration; SoFi was previously compelled to discontinue its crypto services in late 2023 as a condition of receiving a bank charter amid increased federal scrutiny of digital assets. Noto anticipates offering crypto investing options by the end of the year, with broader integration of crypto and blockchain technology across SoFi's product lines within the next six to 24 months, potentially through acquisitions. The company aims to enable borrowing against crypto holdings and facilitate crypto payments, leveraging the evolving regulatory landscape that now permits OCC-regulated banks to engage in crypto businesses.</p>

          <p>Brendan Cox, the husband of the late MP Jo Cox, has urged the Irish rap group Kneecap to issue a genuine apology after footage surfaced of the band allegedly calling for violence against MPs. Cox criticized the band's initial statement as a "half apology" that failed to acknowledge the gravity of their words, and emphasized the potential risk of inciting violence through such remarks. Kneecap's statement followed counter-terrorism police assessment of the footage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch calling for prosecution. Cox expressed willingness to meet with the band to discuss retaining their radicalism while condemning political violence, highlighting the lasting impact of losing a loved one to such acts.</p>

          <p>General Motors surpassed Wall Street's estimates for the first quarter, but is reassessing its full-year financial guidance and suspending stock buybacks due to expected cost increases and industry uncertainty stemming from potential auto tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. CFO Paul Jacobson cited the potential significant impact of tariffs, including 25% levies on imported vehicles, as the reason for the reassessment. The company is making adjustments to its North American production but deferring significant capital changes until there is more clarity on the levies. Despite strong first-quarter results, GM reported a $300 million negative impact from foreign exchange and $400 million in additional costs.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores the historical and social transformation of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, through the lens of buildings once occupied by Americans during the Vietnam War. The article focuses on structures like the Pittman building, formerly used by the CIA, and the U.S. Information Service office, now repurposed for modern Vietnamese life. Through interviews with residents and workers, the article highlights how these spaces have evolved, reflecting the nation's journey from postwar deprivation to embracing free trade, while still grappling with the legacies of war and regional divisions. The story underscores the complex interplay of history, pragmatism, and lingering distrust in shaping Vietnam's present.</p>

          <p>PayPal reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but missed on revenue and maintained its 2025 forecast due to macroeconomic uncertainties, causing a slight dip in its stock price. Despite a modest 1% increase in sales, the company emphasized its focus on profitability over volume, as transaction margin dollars grew by 7%. Total payment volume, however, fell short of estimates, while the number of active accounts increased by 2%. Venmo's revenue saw a 20% year-over-year increase, driven by growth in Pay with Venmo transactions and debit card usage.</p>

          <p>A software outage caused by Oracle engineers led to a five-day disruption at several Community Health Systems hospitals, forcing them to revert to paper-based patient records. The outage, which began on April 23, was triggered when engineers mistakenly deleted critical storage connected to a key database during maintenance work. CHS reported that the outage affected "several" hospitals, while Becker's Hospital Review indicated that 45 hospitals were impacted. Despite the significant disruption, CHS stated that its hospitals maintained services without any material impact, and that the incident was not related to a cyberattack.</p>

Hoge cautioned against high expectations, predicting Sanders could be an "epic failure" that sets an organization back, while acknowledging Sanders' toughness.

          <p>Despite President Trump's initial distancing from Project 2025, many of his administration's policies after the first 100 days closely align with the initiative's blueprint for overhauling the executive branch. Key actions include steps towards abolishing the Department of Education, ending diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, and shifting FEMA costs to the states. The administration is also targeting PBS and National Public Radio, freezing federal assistance, restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and revoking security clearances, all echoing proposals outlined in Project 2025.

The administration is also working to close the Education Department, carry out mass deportations, implement tariffs, and withdraw from the Paris climate accords.

This comes after the National Republican Congressional Committee advised against in-person town halls, following incidents of Republicans facing criticism over federal worker firings and budget cuts. Congresswoman Kat Cammack has not held a town hall since before Trump took office, prompting voters in her district to organize their own events to address concerns about cuts to federal services, Social Security, and the Trump administration's actions. Cammack's office stated they meet with constituents individually and have hosted town halls in the past, dismissing the "empty chair" events as performative.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring ideas to encourage marriage and increase birth rates, including a lump-sum "baby bonus," which the president has expressed support for, but the idea is stirring debate about the agenda of the pronatalist movement. Baby bonuses, common in other countries, aim to provide financial relief to new parents, but some worry that embracing them would bolster traditional gender roles and reproductive oppression. While baby bonuses could provide short-term financial relief, critics argue that the focus should be on deeper societal investments that parents need, such as affordable childcare and paid parental leave.</p>

The discovery sheds light on the presence of musical instruments in concentration camps and the resilience of individuals who found ways to express their creativity amidst the horrors of the Holocaust.
