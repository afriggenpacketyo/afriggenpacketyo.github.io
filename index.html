            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire for allegedly sharing details of a U.S. airstrike in Yemen via a private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother, and personal attorney. This marks the second instance of Hegseth sharing sensitive military information through unsecure channels. The messages reportedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets targeting Houthi rebels. The Defense Department maintains that no classified information was shared, but the incident raises concerns about the handling of sensitive military data. </p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) steady, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as China focuses on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Despite better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter, the PBOC's move suggests a cautious approach to managing currency stability amidst external pressures. The LPRs influence corporate and household loans, and the decision aligns with economists' expectations.</p>

            <p>Shanghai welcomed a record 220,000 spectators for the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, projected to bring over $685 million in economic benefits.

The sports industry is becoming a focal point for local governments, which are integrating it with other fields to boost economic activity.

            <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital, Sanaa, reportedly killed 12 people and wounded 30, according to Houthi rebels. The strikes are part of an intensified U.S. campaign against the rebels, who have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea and Israel. The recent strikes follow the resumption of negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, linking Tehran's nuclear program to the attacks in Yemen. Assessing the full impact of the airstrikes remains challenging due to limited information from both the U.S. military and the Houthis.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," non-sexual unions driven by practical advantages, are gaining traction. These marriages, often between individuals not romantically or sexually attracted to each other, provide social security benefits and fulfill societal expectations. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such marriages in the past decade, offering an alternative for those who don't fit traditional marriage norms. While some see it as a desperate measure due to the lack of same-sex marriage recognition, others view it as a practical partnership from the outset.</p>

China is digging in for a long fight and could use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the immediate impact, but resolving its own economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market, is key. Despite challenges, China's leadership recognizes that the current U.S. strategy aims to systematically impede China's economic growth, prompting a focus on internal reforms.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU appealed to prevent removals, arguing that individuals were not given a chance to argue their case in court. White House officials claim the detainees are "foreign terrorists," while critics argue due process rights are being violated.
