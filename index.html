          <h2>Kneecap Rap Group Apologizes for Remarks About Murdered MPs Amidst Funding Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 04:14:46 EDT</div>

          <p>The Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member seemingly calling for violence against politicians. The statement, posted on X, comes amidst scrutiny from counter-terrorism police and calls for prosecution from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch. Kneecap rejected any suggestion that they would incite violence and stated the footage was taken out of context, while DUP MP Carla Lockhart is calling for the group to be denied entry to the USA and Canada ahead of their North America tour. The group previously won a discrimination case against the UK government after arts funding was withdrawn. Optimism score does not apply to this article.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Society of Radiographers is advocating for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms, citing critical staff shortages among female radiographers specializing in breast screening. Currently, mammograms, X-rays used to check for breast cancer, can only be performed by female staff. While some women express concerns about male radiographers, others emphasize the importance of life-saving procedures regardless of the provider's gender. This proposal aims to increase recruitment and address vacancy rates among mammographers, potentially expanding access to qualified professionals in this field.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy alternatives, to combat obesity. This proposal aims to remove the existing exemption for milk-based drinks, as these beverages contribute to high sugar intake, particularly among children. The government is also proposing reducing the maximum sugar content allowed before the levy applies, from 5g to 4g per 100ml. While the original exemption was due to concerns about calcium consumption, the Treasury now argues that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by authoritarian tendencies, economic instability, and foreign policy disruptions, leading to low approval ratings. His trade war has injected chaos into the economy, undermining promises to lower prices and raising the specter of recession. Executive orders have bypassed Congress, and the 'department of government efficiency' led by Elon Musk has caused turmoil in medical research and social welfare programs. Critics highlight a combination of a focused agenda and reckless incompetence, resulting in a betrayal of his own base.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been characterized by strained alliances, alienated allies, and disrupted global trade, with tariffs impacting supply chains in the United States. The administration's actions, operating mainly through executive action, have affected nearly all facets of US foreign policy, from military might to soft power. Critics argue that trust in America has been broken, and key foreign policy institutions are in crisis. The US's relationship with Ukraine has also been strained, with a cutoff in US military and intelligence sharing.</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley anticipate that the US and China will engage in negotiations to gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% by the end of the second quarter. Despite conflicting statements from both countries, the prediction is that trade disruptions could be a gateway to negotiations, although tariffs are unlikely to revert to pre-January 25 levels. More comprehensive talks later in the year could lead to further tariff reductions, potentially reaching 34% by year’s end, but the damage to the economic cycle has already been done.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win enough seats to form a government in Canada, though it's unclear if they'll secure a majority. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, are expected to remain in opposition. The election saw a significant rise in support for both major parties at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the NDP, whose leader lost his seat. Canada's "first-past-the-post" system resulted in the Liberals and Conservatives dominating the seat count despite smaller parties receiving a substantial share of the popular vote.</p>

          <p>A poll indicates that over half of Britons feel some aspects of their lives are 'out of control', with personal finances being a significant concern for many. The survey, commissioned by Smart Energy GB, found that physical health, work, and personal finances are the areas where people feel least in control. In response, Smart Energy GB is partnering with the Professional Darts Corporation and a sports psychologist to provide strategies for managing stress and regaining control. One suggestion is using smart meters to manage energy bills more effectively.</p>

This call comes after the Trump administration's 'Liberation Day' tariff plan, which has intensified the trade battle between the two countries.

          <p>Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Shin Bet, has publicly voiced concerns about the erosion of Israel’s democratic values and the abandonment of hostages in Gaza. Along with other former security officials, Ayalon took out an advertisement expressing that the current government is undermining democratic functions for its own gain, and is pushing the country into perpetual war. He called on allies, including governments and diaspora Jewish communities, to support the Israeli people rather than the government. Ayalon stated that silence is a show of support for the Israeli government.</p>
