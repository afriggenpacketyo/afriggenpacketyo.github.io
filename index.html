        <p>The Trump administration issued an ultimatum to Columbia University, demanding significant changes to student discipline and admissions policies before considering the reinstatement of $400 million in government funding.  The demands stem from accusations of the university's failure to protect Jewish students from harassment.  Specific demands include formalizing antisemitism definitions, banning identity-concealing masks, and placing the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership.</p>
