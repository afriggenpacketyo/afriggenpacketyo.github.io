          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voiced his frustration with the Trump administration's decision to postpone a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, labeling it "outrageous" and "derelict." Schumer emphasized the legal obligation of the administration to inform Congress about the situation, questioning their reasons for withholding critical details regarding the recent strikes and long-term strategies to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The House's classified briefing was also postponed, prompting criticism from lawmakers, including Nancy Pelosi, who called it an "intolerable insult" to Congress. Representative Thomas Massie is reconsidering pulling a War Powers Resolution following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are scheduled to wed in Venice, Italy, this week, with a three-day celebration potentially costing between $64 million and $76 million. The wedding is expected to draw high-profile guests, with at least 95 private planes requesting permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. However, the event has also sparked protests from locals who are frustrated with the city's focus on wealthy tourists and the failure to address residents' needs, with one group unfurling a banner in St. Mark's Square criticizing Bezos for renting Venice for his wedding while avoiding taxes. Despite the criticism, Venetian officials have defended their decision to welcome the event, asserting that it will not significantly disrupt daily life.</p>

Judge Brian Murphy cited a previous order requiring migrants facing deportation to a country other than their origin to have the chance to assert potential dangers. Solicitor General D. John Sauer called Murphy's ruling "a lawless act of defiance" and argued that it jeopardizes the Executive's ability to carry out third-country removals.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting that it violates Article 2 of the Constitution, which grants the president authority as commander-in-chief. Johnson stated that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets was within his constitutional powers. Johnson also mentioned that Representative Thomas Massie may not advance his War Powers resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds. Trump has criticized Massie for his opposition to the tax and spending bill, calling him a "Third Rate Congressman."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was in effect, despite initial accusations that both sides had violated the agreement. Trump voiced frustration with both countries for their actions, particularly Israel's strikes shortly before the ceasefire was due to begin. After speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump stated that Israel would refrain from further attacks. The conflict, which began on June 13, resulted in numerous casualties and heightened tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider strategic steps before investing in the precious metal, given its role as an income protector rather than an income producer. Investors should weigh the decision to wait for a price drop, determine how much of their portfolio to allocate to gold, and assess their portfolio's specific needs. Consulting with a financial advisor or gold investing company can help guide these decisions, especially as the price of gold could rise in July (not investment advice). The goal is to make informed choices that align with individual financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>
