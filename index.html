          <p>The Tall Ships Races have commenced in Aberdeen, Scotland, an event expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors. Organizers aim to create a "party city" atmosphere with musical performances from bands like Deacon Blue and Kaiser Chiefs, alongside numerous family-friendly attractions. Despite the festive preparations, a Met Office yellow warning for heavy rain poses a potential disruption to the four-day event. The races, featuring nearly 50 vessels from around the world, are designed to foster international friendship and provide sailing training for young people.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 04:11:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovenia's parliament has passed a law legalizing medically assisted suicide, making it the first Eastern European nation to do so. The legislation, approved with a 50-34 vote, follows a referendum where 55% of voters supported the right to end-of-life autonomy. The law applies to mentally competent, terminally ill adults who are suffering unbearably and have exhausted other treatment options, excluding those with only mental illnesses. While hailed as a landmark decision for compassion and dignity, implementation is pending as procedural and oversight mechanisms are still being developed.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence has stated it will not proactively offer compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal details were leaked in February 2022 and who were not evacuated to Britain. The MoD intends to "robustly defend" against legal action, citing an independent review which concluded it is "highly unlikely" that being on the leaked spreadsheet would directly lead to an individual being targeted by the Taliban. This decision comes after a super-injunction on the matter was lifted, revealing the breach affected over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation, many of whom now fear for their safety.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being seen as a significant moment for Muslim and South Asian American political representation. His campaign, built on a platform of affordability and advocacy for Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters, including working-class South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise highlights a shift in the Democratic base, where issues like the conflict in Gaza and economic justice are gaining prominence. His success is viewed by many as a hopeful sign of challenging long-held assumptions about who can lead a major American city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has described media reports concerning the cause of the fatal Air India Boeing Dreamliner crash as "premature and speculative." This statement follows the release of a preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which noted a cockpit conversation about the engine fuel cutoff switches just before the crash that killed 270 people. The NTSB and Indian authorities have urged caution, emphasizing that complex investigations take time and that drawing conclusions from selective information is irresponsible. The AAIB's report did not definitively state what caused the fuel to be cut off.</p>

While many experts, like Eddie Hearn and Tony Bellew, favor the technical skill of the 38-year-old Usyk to win again, others believe the 27-year-old Dubois has significantly improved and possesses the power to cause an upset.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The novel approach uses gene therapy tools to generate the specialized anticancer cells directly within the patient's body, bypassing the expensive and complex external manufacturing process. A study published in The Lancet reports the successful treatment of four multiple myeloma patients using this in-vivo technique. This innovation could significantly reduce the cost of CAR-T therapy, which currently can exceed US$139,200 per treatment, and make it more accessible.</p>

Despite government initiatives like tax breaks and baby bonuses, many Italians find the support insufficient to offset the challenges of high childcare costs and career instability.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation, which passed with strong bipartisan support, requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets and aims to legitimize their use for payments, potentially boosting the role of the U.S. dollar in the digital economy. The crypto industry, which heavily lobbied for the bill, views it as a major victory, while critics express concern that the law lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings, observed in mice, could help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis despite successful initial treatment. The research team also identified that combining chemotherapy with specific drugs could inhibit this process. A clinical trial based on these findings is already underway with breast cancer patients, offering a potential strategy to improve future cancer treatments.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has imposed strict measures on former President Jair Bolsonaro, ordering him to wear an electronic ankle tag and abide by a nighttime curfew. The restrictions, which Bolsonaro called a "supreme humiliation," were implemented over concerns he might flee the country while facing trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The decision follows police raids on his properties and comes amid escalating tensions with the U.S., where President Trump has threatened tariffs on Brazil in an attempt to pressure authorities to drop the case against his ally.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its parent companies, News Corp and Dow Jones, over an article detailing his alleged relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit targets a report about a sexually suggestive letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein for his 50th birthday, which Trump vehemently denies writing. The publisher has expressed full confidence in its reporting and stated it will vigorously defend against the suit. The legal action comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to be more transparent about the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is shuttering its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific research arm. The move is part of a broader reorganization and is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and save nearly $750 million. The ORD conducts vital research on environmental pollutants and their effects on human health. This action is part of a significant reduction in force at the EPA under the Trump administration, which has seen its total staff cut by about 22%. Critics, including former EPA officials, warn that dismantling the office is dangerous and will leave the public more vulnerable to pollution.</p>

          <p>China's top disciplinary body is highlighting a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful and misguided local governance. The "Yaohan Longevity City," intended as a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after poor decision-making and a broken capital chain, resulting in a "severe waste of resources." By publicizing this and other cases, Beijing is sending a strong message to local officials across the country to avoid vanity projects that are out of touch with reality. The official who backed the project has since been expelled from the Communist Party for corruption.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of China's existing naval electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, while a technological first, is limited in its firing power, as excessive current can damage the weapon and it can only fire relatively light projectiles. The proposed design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which researchers claim would increase bore pressure enough to launch a 30kg projectile at Mach 7. This innovation aims to overcome existing limitations and advance the military application of electromagnetic railgun technology.</p>
