          <p>The S&P 500 experienced its largest gain in over a month following indications of de-escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China.

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab report indicates that the U.S. average effective tariff rate remains at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, despite recent trade deals with China and the United Kingdom. The report estimates that current tariff policies will cost the average household $2,800 in the short term. Consumers and businesses are expected to adjust their purchasing behavior to avoid higher costs, particularly on goods from China. The recent tariff reductions are primarily attributed to lower rates on Chinese imports, with minimal impact from the U.K. trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>
