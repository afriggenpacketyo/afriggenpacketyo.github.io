          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, after being arrested during a protest outside a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility, has vowed to continue his city's legal battle against the Geo Group, the company running the facility. Baraka stated that the city's contention with the Geo Group will continue in court, addressing concerns about the lack of transparency regarding who is being held in the detention center and the facility's alleged non-compliance with local laws. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has indicated more arrests are forthcoming and accused members of Congress of assaulting ICE enforcement officers during the protest, while Baraka insists he did nothing wrong and was treated like a regular criminal case. The article highlights the ongoing tensions between local officials and federal authorities over immigration enforcement and detention practices.</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S.-led mediation resulting in a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, both countries have accused each other of violating the agreement shortly after it was reached. India reported multiple explosions in India-administered Kashmir and accused Pakistan of border intrusion, while Pakistan denied the violations and claimed India had committed them in some areas. The article outlines the immediate aftermath of the ceasefire announcement, the reactions from both sides, and the involvement of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey in facilitating the deal.

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have discovered the wreckage of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857. The "significant discovery" was announced by the Australian National Maritime Museum and the SilentWorld Foundation after a four-year search. The article notes that the ship was carrying over 400 Chinese miners shortly before its sinking, connecting the find to stories of trade and migration. The wreckage includes the ship's windlass, and researchers found a magnetic anomaly matching the ship's length, confirming its identity.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports on the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an immigration detention facility, highlighting the potential for assault charges against three Democratic members of Congress who were present. The article details the events leading up to Baraka's arrest, including a congressional oversight visit to the facility and conflicting accounts of the confrontation between lawmakers and federal agents. The article notes that the Trump administration's spokeswoman suggested assault charges could be on the table for the three lawmakers, as the mayor was arrested on federal trespassing charges, but the video evidence appears inconclusive.

          <p>In San Jose, California, a cold case murder from 1977 has been solved with the arrest of Willie Eugene Sims, 69, after nearly 50 years. Jeannette Ralston, a young mother, was found strangled in her car, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The break came when the San Jose police identified Mr. Sims’ thumbprint on a cigarette carton using an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint search algorithm. The article also mentions that Mr. Sims had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery. The victim's son expressed gratitude for the investigators' dedication to solving the case.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, featuring an eight-tier hospitality section with Michelin-star menus, a rooftop pool, and views of the River Thames. The rooftop pool does not have a view of the pitch. The stand is designed more like a five-star hotel or cruise ship than a traditional football stadium, with a focus on the river view rather than the game itself. The stand will also operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays, targeting wealthy local residents.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China have commenced high-stakes trade negotiations in Geneva, aiming to de-escalate tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are the first since tariffs were significantly increased by both countries. The article notes that expectations for a major breakthrough are low, but the fact that talks are happening at all has raised hopes of defusing the conflict. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing a prolonged economic war could lead to slower global growth and higher prices.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has described the outcome of talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv as a "significant moment" in the effort to secure a ceasefire with Russia, although he admits it's not "the end of the process". The article states that around 30 global leaders reaffirmed their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening "massive" sanctions if non-compliance continues. In a phone call following the meeting, President Trump reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire after Vladimir Putin rejected his initial proposal. The Kremlin reacted by accusing European leaders of making "contradictory" remarks about Russia.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, policy experts are highlighting key issues to watch. Republican lawmakers, with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, can pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation. The article notes that the House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary text, but the bill could change significantly before the final vote. The narrow Republican majority in the House and competing priorities could make the process difficult.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first U.S. at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a new device by Teal Health. The article notes that the Teal Wand uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample, which women then mail to a lab for HPV testing. The FDA approval follows a U.S.-based study that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. At-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries.</p>
