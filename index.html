        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has issued a list of art at Smithsonian institutions it deems objectionable for focusing on topics like race, slavery, and sexuality, prompting a review to align the museums with the administration's cultural directives. This move has drawn criticism and concern from artists and scholars, some of whom fear it will lead to censorship and have a chilling effect on artistic expression. While some artists feel targeted, others consider being on the list a 'badge of honor,' comparing the action to historical instances of political suppression of art. The controversy raises questions about partisan influence over national cultural institutions and the freedom of artists.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A political analysis suggests that President Trump's domestic and foreign policy decisions are consistently shaped by his personal interests rather than a coherent ideology. Recent events, such as taking advice from Vladimir Putin on U.S. election integrity and using meetings with foreign leaders to air domestic grievances, illustrate this trend. Critics argue this approach makes the president susceptible to manipulation and blurs the lines between national objectives and personal validation. This conflation of self-interest with state affairs marks a significant departure from the conduct of previous administrations, raising concerns about U.S. consistency and reliability on the global stage.</p>

          <p>North Korea has announced that it successfully test-fired two new types of missiles under the supervision of leader Kim Jong Un. According to state media, the missiles are designed to counter aerial threats like attack drones and cruise missiles. The launches occurred as the United States and South Korea were conducting their annual joint military exercises, which Pyongyang has consistently condemned as provocative. A North Korean military official described the U.S.-South Korea drills as reckless actions by 'warmongers' that are destabilizing the region and pushing tensions to an extreme level.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have heavily bombarded the eastern and northern outskirts of Gaza City with airstrikes and tank shelling, causing widespread destruction. The military operation is part of an effort to dismantle militant infrastructure ahead of a planned major offensive on what Israel describes as Hamas's last stronghold. The continued assault has triggered panic among residents, with some families attempting to flee while others remain, citing a lack of safe alternatives and resources. Amid the escalating conflict, a global hunger monitor has officially declared a state of famine in Gaza City, a claim Israel disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China should view India as a strategic partner rather than a rival to reset bilateral relations and reform the global order. Recent positive developments, including high-level diplomatic visits and discussions to resume direct flights, signal a potential thaw in relations. The author suggests that global uncertainties and recent U.S. tariff policies toward India create an opportunity for Sino-Indian collaboration. To move forward, Beijing is encouraged to look past long-standing border disputes and recognize India's commitment to strategic autonomy, fostering cooperation for mutual benefit.</p>

          <p>Over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's Northern Strike military exercises in Michigan, marking Taiwan's largest-ever involvement in the U.S.-led drills. The public disclosure of these figures by Pentagon-linked media is seen as a significant deepening of defense cooperation between Washington and Taipei. This development represents a notable shift from the previous policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's role in American military exercises. The increased participation highlights a strengthening of the unofficial alliance, even as the Trump administration's foreign policy approach is often described as transactional.</p>

The Irish folk band claimed their set was cut short after they displayed a Palestinian flag and led a 'Free Palestine' chant. Organizers initially cited a 'discriminatory' chant but later apologized, admitting they mishandled the situation and pledging a donation to humanitarian efforts in Palestine.

The project, which victims' associations say is long overdue, is expected to receive federal funding, allowing a design competition to begin soon. The memorial will honor those who were persecuted, imprisoned, or killed by the authoritarian German Democratic Republic (GDR) regime between 1949 and 1989.

          <p>In Estonia, citizens are actively participating in civil defense training as concerns over a potential Russian invasion persist, particularly since the full-scale war in Ukraine began. Organizations like the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization have seen increased membership, with volunteers learning skills from first aid to military basics. While analysts believe a direct military assault is unlikely due to Estonia's NATO membership and superior Western technology, acts of Russian sabotage like GPS jamming are a more immediate concern. The nation is significantly increasing its defense spending, reflecting a deeply rooted culture of self-defense and preparedness.</p>

          <p>Amid rising security concerns across Europe, particularly regarding an aggressive Russia, tens of thousands of French citizens are applying to join the military reserves. The number of operational reservists has soared in the last decade, and the government aims to more than double the current figure to 105,000 by 2035. This trend reflects a broader European movement to bolster military manpower, with some nations reintroducing compulsory service. In France, the volunteer effort is driven by a desire to protect the country, with recruits from diverse backgrounds undergoing rigorous training to support the active-duty military.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has asserted that Chinese ownership of American farmland poses no threat to U.S. national security. Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03 percent of total U.S. farmland and characterized claims to the contrary as 'completely unfounded.' He argued that legislative efforts in some states to restrict such purchases are a form of political manipulation under the pretext of security. The ambassador called for continued agricultural cooperation between the two nations rather than allowing political agendas to create unnecessary barriers.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it an 'abuse of power' and an attempt to 'manufacture a crisis.' The governor stated that there is no emergency justifying such a deployment in his state. This follows the president's move to send troops to Washington D.C. as part of a broader crackdown on crime in major Democrat-run cities. Chicago's mayor also expressed 'grave concerns' about the potential for an uncoordinated deployment to inflame local tensions and undermine progress in reducing crime.</p>
