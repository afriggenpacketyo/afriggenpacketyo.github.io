          <p>A senior White House official stated that President Trump is "not interested" in engaging in a call with Tesla CEO Elon Musk to resolve their ongoing dispute, despite reports of White House aides scheduling such a call. This follows escalating tensions between Musk and Trump, particularly after Musk criticized the Republican president's proposed tax bill. The feud began after Musk's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency concluded last week, with both figures exchanging verbal blows in recent days. Trump himself stated he was "not particularly" interested in talking to Musk, referring to him as a man who "has lost his mind."</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a climb in premarket trading following a significant drop fueled by tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts cited a report that Trump had scheduled a call with Musk to broker a truce, though the White House denied these plans. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggested that reconciliation between Musk and Trump would benefit Tesla shares, which he believes were oversold due to the conflict. Investors are closely monitoring the situation as Musk and Trump's relationship impacts market sentiment.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially declared that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies, a decision that was later reversed. This announcement came after Trump criticized Musk and his businesses, leading to a heated exchange on social media. Musk later stated, "Ok, we won't decommission Dragon," after an X user urged him to reconsider, highlighting the volatility of the situation. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, adding significance to Musk's initial decision and subsequent reversal.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a lower court's ruling that held former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) liable for damages related to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus revoking the order for the executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. Shareholders seeking damages criticized the ruling as fundamentally flawed and expressed their intention to appeal the decision. The ruling emphasized that nuclear plant operators should continue efforts to prevent similar accidents from happening again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Resentment, a silent weapon in relationships, stems from perceived wrongs and broken expectations that are not addressed, leading to bitterness. Experts say that resentment often arises when one feels inferior or experiences repeated injustices, causing them to harbor negative emotions without taking action. Over time, resentment can grow into contempt, leading to detachment, passive-aggressive behavior, and a desire to undermine the other person. To address resentment, experts recommend communicating needs directly, focusing on feelings without blaming, and finding solutions to preserve and improve the relationship.</p>
