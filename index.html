A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody as authorities investigate the cause of the fire. Two other individuals were hospitalized, and the London Fire Brigade brought the fire under control after several hours. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's latest fiscal policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are facing increased skepticism from Wall Street, causing turmoil in global financial markets. The act extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts while cutting spending on programs like Medicaid, leading to concerns about rising deficits and debt. Moody's has already stripped the U.S. of its triple-A credit rating, and the yield on 30-year U.S. government bonds has risen above 5%.

          <p>A recent study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week remotely. Hybrid working patterns have become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. Despite some companies enforcing strict return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized in the UK since 2023. The research suggests that remote work has become a defining feature of the UK labor market, prompting businesses and policymakers to rethink office space and transport. </p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, largely benefiting wealthy Americans and corporations. The bill includes controversial cuts to the corporate tax rate and government assistance programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Critics argue that the bill is fiscally irresponsible and regressive, as it disproportionately benefits high-income individuals while cutting essential services for working-class families. Economists also say that the tax cuts have done little to help the middle class, with companies spending more on stock buybacks than on wage growth. </p>

          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Scientists discovered that the anatomy of these flakes of invertebrate armor resembled the teeth of vertebrates, indicating a shared ability to sense the environment. By examining the tooth-like scales of modern-day fish embryos, they found nerves, suggesting that the armor of ancient fish allowed them to sense the water around them. This discovery explains why humans experience toothaches and highlights the evolutionary connection between ancient marine life and modern human anatomy. </p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, which was originally due in the spring. The Child Poverty Taskforce is still working on the strategy, considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The delay has been criticized by opposition parties and charities, who argue that it prolongs hardship for families. The government maintains its commitment to publishing the strategy later this year. </p>
