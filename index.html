          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment. President Trump highlighted copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies, noting it is the second most used material by the Department of Defense. The announcement caused a significant spike in copper prices, raising concerns among experts about potential price increases for consumers and industries that rely heavily on the metal, which the U.S. imports nearly half of its supply. This article covers the direct announcement and immediate market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza. The move follows her vocal criticism of Israel's military actions, which she has described as a "genocide," and her support for International Criminal Court actions against Israeli officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Albanese's "campaign of political and economic warfare" would not be tolerated, while human rights groups condemned the sanctions as an attempt to silence a UN expert for fulfilling her duties. The decision underscores ongoing tensions surrounding the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A one-year-old boy has died in Bakersfield, California, after being left in a car with his two-year-old sibling on a day with 101-degree temperatures. The mother, Maya Hernández, had left the children in the vehicle for approximately 90 minutes while she attended an appointment at a medical spa. According to police, the car's engine, which was left running for the air conditioning, automatically shut off after an hour, leading to a rapid rise in internal temperature. The infant was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead, while his sibling survived and is now in protective custody.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector, Choi Min-kyung, is preparing to file both civil and criminal charges against leader Kim Jong Un and other officials for alleged torture and sexual abuse. Choi, who was forcibly repatriated to North Korea in 2008 before escaping again in 2012, is being assisted by a South Korea-based human rights group. This case is noted as the first instance of a North Korean-born defector taking direct legal action against the regime's leadership. While enforcement of any ruling is unlikely, advocates say the legal action provides crucial acknowledgment and a historical record for victims.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a steep 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, explicitly linking the trade measure to the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, Trump called the proceedings against his political ally a "Witch Hunt that should end immediately" and an "international disgrace." The move, which is the highest tariff rate threatened against any country so far, also cited alleged unfair trade practices and attacks on the free speech rights of American companies. The U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil, making the justification for the tariff particularly unusual.</p>

          <p>A new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam highlights extreme wealth inequality in Africa, revealing that the continent's four richest individuals possess more wealth than the bottom 50% of its population, or about 750 million people. The combined wealth of Africa's 23 billionaires has surged by 56% in the last five years to $112.6 billion. Oxfam argues that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems allow this extreme accumulation of wealth. The report suggests that a modest wealth and income tax on the richest 1% could generate enough revenue to fund education and electricity access.</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, who were poisoned by a severe toxic algal bloom, have been successfully treated and released back into the wild in Huntington Beach. The bloom was the deadliest such event in the region since 2015, sickening hundreds of seabirds and other marine animals with domoic acid. The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center treated nearly 200 birds during the crisis. The public release of the recovered pelicans serves as a positive symbol of resilience and the importance of wildlife rehabilitation efforts in the face of growing environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas yielded vastly different outcomes, illustrating the impact of community preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, which was still vulnerable from last year's wildfires, a severe flood killed three people but the community was largely prepared, with experts on the ground. In contrast, a flood in Texas just days earlier caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths. Experts note that recent experience with a hazard, like the "burn scars" in New Mexico, informs a community's response and can lead to better adaptation and mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official, speaking anonymously in Washington, has cast doubt on the likelihood of achieving a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The official suggested a 60-day ceasefire might be possible within weeks but stated that a lasting peace is "questionable" and contingent on the complete removal of Hamas. The official reiterated Israel's war aims of returning hostages and eliminating Hamas, indicating that the war would continue if Hamas does not disarm. This assessment highlights the significant gap between the negotiating parties, particularly regarding the status of Israeli forces in Gaza and the future governance of the territory.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. tariff announcements targeting transshipment are creating significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers who have moved operations to Southeast Asian nations to bypass previous duties. The lack of clear implementation details for these new policies leaves businesses in a state of limbo, unable to make firm decisions about their supply chains. Many Chinese companies, which had expanded into countries like Vietnam and Malaysia as part of a "China plus one" strategy, are now pausing further investment. This policy ambiguity is disrupting regional trade and forcing exporters to reconsider their long-term manufacturing and shipping strategies.</p>

The case drew attention after the veteran's daughter found her by tracing her cellphone.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a vital component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Experts warn that the significant duty will increase costs for manufacturers, who will likely pass them on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. While the administration argues the tariff will incentivize domestic production and enhance national security, analysts note that ramping up U.S. copper mining would take many years.
