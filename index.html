          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, continues to make strides toward his pitching comeback after undergoing right elbow surgery in September 2023. During a simulated game, Ohtani struck out six batters in three innings, throwing 44 pitches at Petco Park. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hinted at the possibility of Ohtani returning as a pitcher before the All-Star break, although he emphasized the importance of patience in the process. Ohtani's performance included a fastball clocked at 96 miles per hour, showcasing his command and control over various pitches. The pitching coach, Mark Prior, expressed satisfaction with Ohtani's progress, noting his ability to execute any pitch at will, suggesting a promising return to the mound for the reigning National League MVP.</p>

          <p>Following two days of high-level trade talks in London, officials from the U.S. and China have reached an agreement on a framework to implement the Geneva consensus. The deal, which aims to stabilize the strained relationship between the two countries, now awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Chinese international trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement, which seeks to address violations of the Geneva trade agreement. Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noted that while the agreement signals a commitment to de-escalate tensions, the path to concrete breakthroughs remains uncertain. If approved by both leaders, the framework could lead to the rollback of certain tariffs and measures imposed earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has declared a curfew for downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests, citing concerns about vandalism and looting. The curfew area encompasses one square mile, bordered by the 5, 110, and 10 Freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and individuals experiencing homelessness. The protests, triggered by recent immigration raids, have led to nearly 469 arrests and the looting of 23 businesses. President Trump has deployed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal offices, a move opposed by Governor Newsom, who has accused Trump of exacerbating the situation. The mayor hopes the curfew will help restore order and prevent further damage.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read trial, which began in April, is nearing its end as the defense called Dr. Andrew Rentschler, an expert on biomechanics, as their final witness. Read is accused of backing her Lexus into Boston police officer John O'Keefe and leaving him to die in a blizzard in January 2022. Rentschler's testimony aimed to challenge the prosecution's claim that the damage to O'Keefe's clothing and Read's SUV was consistent with a collision. Rentschler testified that a 15 mph collision between a crash dummy's head and a taillight like Read's wouldn't have resulted in a skull fracture. Read has announced that she will not testify in her own defense.</p>

The incident occurred during a visit by McIver and other members of Congress, during which protesters clashed with law enforcement, leading to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted President Trump to deploy active-duty Marines to join the National Guard, leading to legal challenges from California Governor Gavin Newsom. The Marines will integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, trained in de-escalation and crowd control. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a curfew for downtown to curb vandalism and looting. Tensions escalated after thousands protested Trump's deployment of the National Guard, resulting in arrests and property damage. California officials are seeking a court order to restrict the Trump administration's use of military forces, alleging the deployment violates the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will restore several Army base names that originally honored Confederate military figures, undoing a renaming process ordered by Congress. The bases will officially recognize other service members, not Confederates, going forward. The bases will revert to a variation of their original names, honoring other service members who share similar names. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will take immediate action to rename the other seven bases.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to restore the original names of several Army bases that previously honored Confederate military figures, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress. However, the bases will now be named after other service members with similar names, rather than Confederates. For example, Fort Gordon will now honor Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon instead of Confederate John Brown Gordon. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will oversee the renaming of the bases. This move will undo the work of the Naming Commission, which was created to remove Confederate symbols and names from military assets.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second consecutive night of violent disorder, with fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs thrown at police. The unrest, described by police as "racially motivated", led to the use of baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters. Several homes and businesses were attacked, with some properties set on fire and windows smashed. The violence follows an earlier peaceful protest related to an alleged sexual assault, prompting condemnations from political leaders and calls for calm. Police are investigating the incidents and urging those involved to reflect on their actions.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area to support National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines for law enforcement purposes on city streets. U.S. Northern Command states the Marines will integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property.

The administration's decision to federalize the California National Guard and deploy Marines marks a break from tradition, but officials believe it showcases Trump's strength in defending against perceived foreign invaders.
