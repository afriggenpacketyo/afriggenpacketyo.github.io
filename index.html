Musk mentioned dedicating more time to Tesla starting in May. He also touched on robotaxi timelines, Optimus robots, tariffs, and Tesla's energy initiatives, reassuring investors despite a turbulent period for the electric vehicle company.

This disclosure followed reports in February that Elliott had taken a position, fueling speculation that the hedge fund would push BP to shift its strategy back towards oil and gas. BP subsequently announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, a departure from its earlier commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.

          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a decline in international tourists while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas, creating a widening gap in travel spending. Foreign visitors to the U.S. by air fell nearly 10% in March compared to the previous year, while U.S. citizens flying abroad increased by 1.6%. Factors contributing to this imbalance include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar. JPMorgan analysts suggest this decline in foreign travel spending could negatively impact the U.S. GDP by around 0.1% this year.</p>

This has created fractures within the Western alliance, potentially offering China an opportunity to improve its geopolitical position. China faced increasing pressure during the previous administration due to strengthened alliances fostered by the U.S., but now, with strained relationships between the U.S. and its allies, China may find avenues for diplomatic and economic advancement. Avowed trans-Atlanticist leaders have indicated they view the alliance with America as dead.</p>

          <h2>Nuclear Power Stations at Risk After Russia's Actions</h2>

          <p>A report from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) warns that nuclear power stations are increasingly vulnerable to attack following Russia's capture of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. The report suggests that the targeting of nuclear sites is likely to increase as more countries pursue nuclear energy. The study undermines proposals to take control of the Zaporizhzhia power plant as part of a plan to end the war. The report warns that nuclear power plants may be targeted more widely as a result of what has happened in Zaporizhzhia. It also highlights the "dual-use" status of nuclear power stations, which causes deep concern.</p>
