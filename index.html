          <p>Luke Donald, Europe's Ryder Cup captain, has cautioned the US team not to assume a simple repeat of their successful 2023 strategy for the upcoming event at Bethpage. Despite retaining 11 of the 12 players from the victorious Rome team, Donald emphasized that an away match presents a different challenge requiring a new approach. He stated that player profiles change over two years and that pairings and lineups will be adapted accordingly to counter the US team on their home soil. The captain also encouraged his players to embrace the anticipated raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a deal to acquire England defender Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, pending final clearance from the selling club. The 25-year-old is set to undergo a medical and sign a long-term contract after the clubs compromised on a transfer fee. However, Crystal Palace has not yet formally sanctioned the move as they are still seeking a replacement for the key player. This transfer is part of a significant summer spending spree for Liverpool, which is set to become the highest in Premier League history, taking their total outlay to approximately £451.2 million.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which requires school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has affected several classic novels, including Atwood's own "The Handmaid's Tale." Her new story sarcastically portrays overly pure characters to critique the ban and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who supports the new rules. This action is part of a broader pushback against what critics see as a concerning trend of censorship spreading from the US to Canada.</p>

The vehicle, a side-by-side RZR carrying nine people, reportedly overturned and struck a tree after hitting another ATV. Authorities noted that none of the occupants were wearing proper safety restraints or harnesses at the time of the incident. The remote location of the crash complicated rescue efforts for first responders. The deceased adults were the parents of the injured children, who ranged in age from one to twelve.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains at the start of the month, driven by positive developments in the defense and healthcare industries. The U.K. secured a £10 billion warship export deal with Norway, its largest ever by value, which lifted shares for defense contractors like BAE Systems. Simultaneously, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk saw its stock rise after releasing trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than its main competitors.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over the purchase of a flat in Hove. The Conservative party has accused Rayner of hypocrisy and potential tax avoidance, alleging she may have improperly designated the property as her main home to reduce stamp duty. Starmer dismissed the criticism as attempts to "talk her down," praising her as a story of British success from a humble background. Rayner's spokesperson has stated that she paid all relevant duties properly and is working to provide further information for transparency.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier highlights how human activities began to significantly alter the body size evolution of animals during the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from southern France spanning 8,000 years, discovering a key divergence around 1000 AD. While wild species like foxes and rabbits shrank due to habitat loss and intensified hunting, domesticated animals such as sheep and chickens grew larger through selective breeding. This research underscores the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world over the last millennium.</p>

          <p>The intense fan debate over the romantic storyline in the Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the streaming service to launch a campaign for kindness. Fans, divided into "teams" supporting different characters, have reportedly directed harassment towards the show's actors. A board-certified psychiatrist explains this behavior as a sign of parasocial relationships, where viewers form one-sided bonds with media figures. She suggests the blurring lines between fiction and reality, amplified by social media anonymity, may point to a broader societal void and a longing for connection.</p>

While passengers welcome cheaper travel, experts are divided on the potential consequences, with some warning of increased overcrowding on already busy routes or the possibility of overall ticket prices rising to compensate for the lost revenue.

According to media reports citing a diplomatic cable, U.S. consular officers have been instructed to refuse visas for purposes such as business, study, or tourism to nearly all Palestinian applicants. This move expands on a recent pause for visitors from Gaza and the denial of visas to dozens of Palestinian officials. The State Department did not explicitly confirm the policy but stated it was taking steps in compliance with U.S. law and national security, further tightening the Trump administration's stance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, questioning why their positive results are not more widely publicized. His comments, made on social media, come amid significant leadership turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a recent FDA decision to limit new vaccines to high-risk individuals. Trump urged drugmakers to "clear up this MESS" regarding public debate over the efficacy of the medications, referencing his administration's Operation Warp Speed initiative. The statement follows a series of overhauls at federal health agencies led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," explores the unique democratic principles of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB), one of Germany's leading orchestras. Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates with a grassroots structure where all musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions, from selecting conductors to choosing repertoire. The film showcases their work with conductor Paavo Järvi on Joseph Haydn's symphonies, drawing a parallel between the orchestra's collaborative spirit and the democratic themes in Haydn's music. This model of shared ownership and responsibility is presented as a key driver of the orchestra's artistic and financial success.</p>

This temperature is significantly above the long-term average and surpasses the previous record set in 2018. Climate scientists note that a summer this warm is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change, with all five of the UK's hottest summers occurring since the year 2000. The season was characterized by prolonged and widespread heat, with four separate heatwave events, alongside below-average rainfall for most of the country.</p>

          <p>A controversial post-war redevelopment plan for Gaza, reportedly being considered by the Trump administration, envisions transforming the territory into a "Gaza Riviera" under a decade of U.S. trusteeship. The 38-page document proposes the "voluntary" relocation of Gaza's two million residents, who would receive digital tokens in exchange for their property rights during reconstruction. The plan, financed by private investment, calls for building AI-powered smart cities and a manufacturing hub, with Israel maintaining security oversight. Critics have raised concerns about the proposal, which was developed by some of the same individuals behind a controversial humanitarian foundation and does not address international law or Palestinian self-determination.</p>

The 24-year-old Senegalese forward, who joined Chelsea in 2023, had reportedly lost the confidence of manager Enzo Maresca after receiving two red cards during the season. To fill the gap in their attack, Chelsea has signed Argentine forward Facundo Buonanotte on loan from Brighton.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement could significantly harm California's $4 trillion economy, which heavily relies on immigrant labor. Key sectors such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality are particularly vulnerable. A study by the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimates that mass deportations and stricter border policies could cost the state up to $278 billion in GDP. With a declining birthrate and aging population, immigrant workers, including the state's large undocumented population, have become essential for filling critical labor shortages and sustaining business operations across the state.</p>
