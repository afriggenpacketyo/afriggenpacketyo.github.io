          <h2>Activist Investor Elliott Discloses Stake in BP, Shares Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 04:49:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP's shares experienced a surge after activist investor Elliott revealed a stake exceeding 5% in the oil major, which has recently shifted its focus back to oil investments to reassure investors. Elliott's involvement has sparked speculation that BP might further deviate from its green strategy and concentrate on its core oil and gas operations. This development follows BP's earlier announcement of plans to increase fossil fuel investments by $10 billion through 2027, marking a significant change from its initial commitment to reduce emissions to net-zero by 2050. The shift in strategy has led to reduced support for BP's CEO and outgoing Chair during board re-election votes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Negotiations are ongoing to resolve the Birmingham bin workers' strike, now in its seventh week, which has led to significant waste accumulation and public health concerns.

Government officials have urged the union to accept a council offer, stating that regular bin collections have partially resumed. The dispute centers on pay and jobs, with recycling and garden waste collections suspended since the beginning of the year, causing considerable disruption for residents.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been downgraded, with key US officials no longer participating amid speculation about potential concessions. Reports suggest Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in exchange for US recognition of its sovereignty over Crimea, a proposition rejected by Ukrainian President Zelensky. Despite a temporary ceasefire unilaterally called by Putin for the Easter weekend, reports indicate no actual let-up in attacks. The ongoing conflict, dating back to 2014, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties and millions of Ukrainian refugees.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced he will significantly reduce his involvement in the US government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. This decision comes amid protests and boycotts related to Musk's political engagement and his contribution to Trump's re-election campaign. Tesla reported a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% profit decline, attributing some of the challenges to "changing political sentiment" and trade policies. Musk stated that he would continue to advocate for lower tariffs, despite clashes with other Trump administration figures on trade issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is reviewing US-funded international organizations, raising doubts about the future of the United States' involvement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. A hard-right Republican policy framework has proposed a US withdrawal from both institutions, labeling them as costly intermediaries. Trump's tariff policies and the lack of executive director appointments to the IMF and World Bank have fueled concerns about the US's commitment to these organizations. Experts warn that a US withdrawal could create a liquidity crisis and strategically benefit China, which has been expanding its global influence through alternative funding models.</p>

The event has been postponed after plans in Mexico were derailed and refunds were issued. He believes that the public's fascination with such events stems from their meme-like status and a desire to be part of the spectacle, while others view the creator as a visionary deserving of a second chance. He also suggests that the public is more interested in the narratives surrounding scammers than in celebrating legitimate success stories.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs worldwide are experiencing the most severe bleaching event ever recorded, with 84% of them affected due to rising ocean temperatures. This crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, is more intense than previous episodes. Coral bleaching occurs when algae that live within corals are expelled due to warming waters, increasing the corals' risk of disease and starvation. Scientists attribute the widespread bleaching to global warming caused by human activities and warn of the potential disappearance of coral reefs if temperatures continue to rise.</p>

          <p>China is urging European countries to form a united front against President Trump's tariffs, accusing Washington of weaponizing tariffs and violating WTO rules. China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, stated that the US has launched indiscriminate attacks on various countries, harming the interests of other economies. Wang called for Europe to join hands with Beijing to defend the multilateral trading system and uphold international rules. China has imposed tariffs of 125 per cent on all American imports in retaliation for 145 percent extra duties imposed on all U.S. imports of Chinese goods.</p>
