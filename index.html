          <p>Merit Street Media, the media company founded by television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years after its launch. The filing in a Texas court comes after multiple rounds of significant layoffs and reports of financial struggles for the network, which aimed to provide an alternative to what it termed 'woke' culture. Despite the bankruptcy, the company has also initiated a lawsuit against its partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network, alleging a failure to provide agreed-upon national distribution.</p>

          <p>A drive-by mass shooting in Chicago's River North neighborhood has resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The incident occurred late at night when occupants of a dark SUV opened fire on a crowd gathered outside the Artis Lounge, which was hosting an album release party for a local rapper. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. This event is particularly alarming as it took place at the same location as a previous mass shooting in 2022, when the venue operated under a different name.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals startling details in the murder case of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in 2020. The indictment alleges that her remains, found in a shallow grave, were moved there after decomposing at another location. Furthermore, toxicologists found a mixture of animal tranquilizer chemicals in her bone marrow, a substance Barry Morphew admitted to using on deer. This is the second time he has been charged with her murder after initial charges were dismissed, and he maintains his innocence.</p>

          <p>The United States has reached a trade agreement with Vietnam, setting a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports and a 40% duty on goods transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. Analysts see this deal as a significant indicator of the Trump administration's future trade policy, suggesting that other nations, particularly in emerging Asia and the European Union, may face higher, not lower, tariffs. The agreement removes some uncertainty but raises concerns for other economies that may be expected to accept similarly high rates to avoid more punitive measures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell, partially reversing a spike from the previous day, after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly backed Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The yield on 10-year bonds had risen amid market fears that the chancellor might resign after a major U-turn on welfare reforms left a hole in her fiscal plans. Analysts suggest the market's negative reaction to a potential departure indicates support for Reeves's commitment to fiscal discipline, and the Prime Minister's reassurance helped calm investor nerves, though some volatility is expected to remain.

          <p>The American diet, particularly its reliance on ultra-processed foods, is facing increased scrutiny amid rising public health crises like obesity and diabetes. Many food additives and dyes common in the U.S., such as Red Dye 40 and titanium dioxide, are banned or restricted in Europe, prompting calls for regulatory changes. However, the article argues that the core issue is not just additives but the overall American diet, which is high in sugar, saturated fats, and excessive calories. True health improvements will require a broader shift toward whole foods.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the Colombian navy has seized an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or 'narco sub,' equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna. The drone vessel, believed to belong to the powerful Gulf Clan cartel, was not carrying drugs and was likely on a trial run. This discovery marks a significant evolution in drug trafficking technology, as cartels migrate toward sophisticated, autonomous systems that are difficult to detect and track. The use of unmanned vessels also eliminates the risk of crew members being captured and cooperating with authorities.</p>

          <p>In a significant decision, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court has ruled that a 175-year-old state law from 1849 does not prohibit consensual abortions. The ruling clarifies the legal landscape for abortion access in the state, which had been uncertain since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The court's interpretation means that the pre-Civil War era statute, which was originally understood to target feticide, cannot be used to enforce a near-total ban on abortion procedures, thereby keeping access legally protected in Wisconsin for the time being.</p>

          <p>Arsenal Football Club is actively seeking to bolster its attacking lineup this summer, with a primary focus on acquiring a new centre-forward and potentially two attacking midfielders. The club is reportedly pursuing strikers like Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko, with a deal for either likely to cost over Â£70 million. The outcome of the striker search will influence their ability to target creative players such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo or Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. The article suggests this offensive refresh could also lead to the departure of an established player.</p>

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has found that police investigations into historical child grooming cases in Manchester were significantly delayed by the city council's heavy redaction of evidence. Some documents provided to Greater Manchester Police had pages with only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules, but a new, more efficient protocol has since been established. The report noted that while the force has made significant improvements, past failings have led to an 'irrecoverable loss of trust' for some victims.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent actions, including the 'big, beautiful bill' and the military strike on Iran, confirm his presidency is not a break from the past but a reinforcement of long-standing American political orthodoxies. The author contends that the domestic policy bill is a monument to neoliberalism, favoring the wealthy while cutting social programs, and the Iran strike revives neoconservative militarism. Rather than representing the populist change his supporters hoped for, Trump is doubling down on the very ideologies that many Americans are ready to move beyond.</p>
