          <h2>Euro Zone Inflation Remains Steady, ECB Rate Cuts Still Possible</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 05:56:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, defying expectations of a decrease, according to Eurostat data. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, with services inflation also increasing to 3.9%, potentially due to Easter timing effects. Despite this, economists believe the door remains open for further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB), especially as US tariffs impact the labor market. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated that the disinflationary process is on track, although uncertainty remains due to potential countermeasures against US tariffs and Germany's infrastructure package.</p>

          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been classified as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution. The agency stated that the AfD's conception of the German people, based on ethnicity and ancestry, is incompatible with the free democratic order. This designation allows for increased monitoring of the party, although it does not automatically lead to a ban. The deputy leader of the Social Democrat SPD has called for a ban on the AfD following this classification.</p>

Dr. King's protests in Birmingham aimed to condemn segregation and call Americans to action, and his example can inspire those seeking to fight back against injustice today. The author suggests specific actions inspired by King's example, including economic boycotts and leveraging the moral authority of clergy.</p>

          <p>The children of Leonard Bernstein, Nina Bernstein Simmons, Alexander Bernstein, and Jamie Bernstein, explain their decision to allow his music to be played at the Kennedy Center despite President Trump's control over the institution. They believe their father would want his music to be heard, as he strived to embrace and unite humanity through his works. They acknowledge the pressure artists may feel to sever ties with the Kennedy Center but assert that playing Bernstein's music is a rebuke to Trump's policies. The proceeds from upcoming performances will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

          <p>Kellyanne Conway criticizes the Democratic Party's performance in 2025, citing low approval ratings and a disconnect with most Americans. She argues that Democrats are focused on the 2028 election rather than helping the country, and lists 25 specific actions and statements she deems as mistakes. These include turning President Trumpâ€™s Joint Address to Congress into a political theater, glorifying antisemitic protesters, and pushing for electric vehicles while undermining Elon Musk's company. Conway suggests Democrats should focus on border security, tax cuts, and energy independence instead.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks is gaining traction, receiving support from President Trump and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Recent stock trades by lawmakers around tariff announcements have raised concerns about potential insider trading. Proposals include banning lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks, requiring them to shift to blind trusts or mutual funds. Proponents argue that the ban is necessary to prevent conflicts of interest and restore public trust.</p>
