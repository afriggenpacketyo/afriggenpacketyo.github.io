          <p>Auto manufacturer Stellantis has announced preliminary figures indicating a significant net loss of 2.3 billion euros for the first half of 2025. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Fiat, attributes the downturn to increased industrial costs, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs, which alone accounted for a 300 million euro hit. This financial setback follows a 6% year-on-year decline in second-quarter vehicle shipments, with North American shipments falling by 25%. The full financial results are scheduled for release on July 29. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent clash between police and striking miners in 1984. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the inquiry will investigate the events and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. The decision fulfills a Labour manifesto promise and has been cautiously welcomed by campaigners who have sought justice for decades. The inquiry aims to address unanswered questions from one of British industrial history's most contentious episodes.</p>

          <p>In response to deflationary pressures and an uncertain economic outlook, Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Assets under management in these funds have surged from $10 billion at the start of last year to over $50 billion by June 2025. Investors are attracted to the lower costs, liquidity, and diversified exposure offered by ETFs, particularly those tracking corporate notes. This trend reflects a broader shift towards low-risk, fixed-income assets as China's central bank maintains loose monetary policy while warning against excessive bond rallies.

          <p>Europe's petrochemical industry is in a state of crisis, with high production costs and aging facilities leading to a wave of plant closures. Companies like Eni, Dow, and ExxonMobil are shutting down assets as they struggle to compete with cheaper production in the U.S. and the Middle East, and a massive capacity expansion in China. This decline is making Europe increasingly reliant on chemical imports and puts an estimated 50,000 jobs at risk. In response, the European Commission has pledged support for the sector, but some industry leaders fear the action may be too late.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a recent election. Despite the "harsh result," Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning. The defeat reflects voter frustration over rising prices, potential U.S. trade tariffs, and a series of political scandals. This loss of control in the upper house, following a similar loss in the more powerful lower house last year, is expected to undermine the coalition's legislative influence and could create political instability.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison. His gang is blamed for much of the violent crime that has plagued Ecuador and is linked to the assassination of a presidential candidate in 2023. The extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadorean citizens approved the measure, supporting President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime.</p>

          <p>A class of drugs known as GLP-1s, including the active ingredients in Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing significant potential for treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance and infertility, have reported major improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hair loss after taking the drugs. While not yet an approved use, early studies suggest the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss can help rebalance hormones. This could be a game-changing development for a condition that has lacked effective treatments for decades.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died after being pulled into an MRI machine by a 9kg metal weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The incident occurred at a clinic in New York when McAllister entered the MRI room to help his wife, who was undergoing a scan. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately snatched the chain, pulling him violently into the machine and causing a fatal "medical episode." His wife witnessed the event, stating he went limp in her arms. Such accidents are rare but highlight the extreme dangers of bringing metallic objects near active MRI scanners.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast in energy policy is emerging between the U.S. and China, particularly concerning the green energy transition. As global demand for electricity rises due to technologies like AI, China is forging ahead with investments in renewable energy to secure a technological lead. In contrast, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them "unreliable" and a threat to the American electric grid. This divergence in strategy highlights the different paths the two global powers are taking to address both climate change and future energy needs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that he would not approve a stadium deal otherwise. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, which involves redeveloping a site on federal property.</p>
