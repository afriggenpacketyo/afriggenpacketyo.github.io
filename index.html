          <p>China is set to launch its Tianwen-2 mission at the end of May 2025, marking its first attempt to survey and collect samples from an asteroid, Kamo'oalewa, putting China in competition with the US and Japan. The mission, expected to last a decade, involves a "touch-and-go" technique and a second "anchor and attach" technique for sample retrieval. Following the asteroid exploration, Tianwen-2 will analyze the comet 311P/PANSTARRS, furthering China's interplanetary exploration endeavors and contributing to understanding the composition of space objects. The name "Tianwen," derived from a Chinese poem, translates to "Heavenly Questions."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official data indicates that UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills, including water, gas, and electricity. The rise exceeds economists' expectations, pushing inflation further above the Bank of England's 2% target, with housing, household services, transport, and recreation contributing the most. The Bank of England anticipates inflation to peak at 3.7% later in 2025 before declining, leading analysts to reassess potential interest rate cuts this year, with concerns over rising core and services inflation adding to economic uncertainty. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride voiced concerns for families.</p>

Between January 2024 and May 2025, Labrador Sierra obtained a state-issued driver’s license, social security number, and Temporary Protective Status (TPS) from U.S. Immigrations, as well as applying for a visa with legal assistance. School officials contacted police after the family who had been granted guardianship of Labrador Sierra reported that he was not a minor. He is currently held on $50,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court on May 29.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is altering the focus of its Community Policing Development microgrant program, shifting away from initiatives supporting underserved populations and community violence intervention. The Trump administration now prioritizes "immigration and border security," "violent crime prevention," and "uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession" for these grants. This shift marks a departure from the Biden administration's emphasis on "building trust and legitimacy with the community" and addressing racism, trauma, and poverty. The change raises concerns about the potential impact on programs benefiting at-risk youths and underserved communities, although Justice Department officials maintain their commitment to supporting law enforcement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that tropical deforestation reached a new peak in 2024, with over 6.7 million hectares lost, an area roughly the size of Panama. The surge is attributed to increased forest fires, often ignited for industrial agriculture, and rising temperatures exacerbated by climate change. Experts warn that this destruction will devastate economies, livelihoods, and efforts to combat climate change, urging immediate action from countries, banks, and businesses. While deforestation in Indonesia remains low, a newly established Indigenous territory in Bolivia successfully contained fires, highlighting the potential of community-led management.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 05:58:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed. The ruling centers on the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, granting public access for "open-air recreation," which the court interprets to include camping. This decision, celebrated by campaigners, is expected to reignite discussions about public access to land in England, with calls to extend wild camping rights to other areas. The Dartmoor National Park Association emphasized that responsible camping is expected, urging visitors to "tread lightly and leave no trace."</p>

          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The genetic material was found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Britain in 2023 as part of a research program. West Nile virus is typically found in birds and transmitted through bird-biting mosquitoes, but in rare cases, it can be transmitted to humans. The UKHSA has stated that the risk to the general public is "very low" and will issue advice to healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>Women in Sport is calling for sports leaders to take action to address the barriers faced by young black girls in accessing sports, noting that many lose interest in their teens. Research indicates that while twice as many black girls dream of becoming elite athletes compared to white girls, they are the least likely to participate in sports. Issues such as racism, misogyny, and inflexible sporting structures contribute to 48% of black girls falling out of love with sports. The charity advocates for better representation, diversity education, enforcement of anti-racism policies, and community initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has restarted collections on defaulted federal student loans, meaning that Americans behind on payments could face wage garnishment and other financial repercussions. A lender can garnish wages without a court order, provided borrowers receive at least 60 days' notice, potentially beginning in the fall. Borrowers can avoid wage garnishment by making payments, enrolling in income-driven repayment plans, or signing up for loan rehabilitation. The government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security benefits, while borrowers can contest their default status or request loan rehabilitation to regain good standing.</p>

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that Russia has been using Brazil as a launchpad for its elite intelligence officers, known as "illegals," who establish fake Brazilian identities to operate in other countries.

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega tsunami” could potentially wipe a large chunk of America off the map if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, which could sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet. Cities like Seattle and Portland could be devastated, and the waves could reach up to 1,000 feet.

Republicans contend the EPA waivers allowing California to impose emissions reductions are not subject to the review law, and this is about protecting the Senate's power. The House has already voted to overturn the waivers, setting up a contentious battle in the Senate over environmental policy and legislative procedure.</p>

The concerns being discussed — what’s been going on, for how long, and what should have been done? — often arise when someone receives a serious illness diagnosis. As a palliative care doctor, Dr. Rachael Bedard waits to discuss the prognosis until a patient is ready, but when it comes to the people running the country, these conversations should be approached with compassion, not patience. She hopes that Mr. Biden’s coming months are full of grace and meaning, that his cancer responds to treatment and that his prognosis is good.</p>
