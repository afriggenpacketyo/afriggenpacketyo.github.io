        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has started releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, resulting in cheaper rice products hitting store shelves. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. Consumers have been flocking to purchase the more affordable rice, with some stores selling out within minutes of opening. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this initiative will effectively curb rising rice prices, switching from auctions to direct sales to retailers for better price control. Optimism for consumers is tempered by the underlying economic pressures driving the need for cheaper alternatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German-Greek relations are facing tension due to Germany's plan to send asylum seekers back to Greece, a move opposed by Athens. While both countries share a desire to curb irregular immigration, their interests diverge due to Greece being an EU external border and a primary reception country for migrants. Germany's Federal Administrative Court ruling that migrants do not face extreme hardships in Greece has provided a legal basis for deportations, but Greece is resistant to accepting a large influx of returnees. Greece is instead focusing on border protection and seeking a migration agreement with Libya to manage immigration flows.</p>

The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022.

          <p>Brazil's environmental movement is under threat as President Lula sides with the oil industry, undermining Environment Minister Marina Silva's efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest. Silva faced political bullying in a senate meeting, highlighting the challenges in balancing economic interests with environmental protection. Lula's support for oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas and the passage of a bill stripping environmental licensing powers from Silva's ministry signal a shift in priorities. Despite public support for Silva, Lula's actions reflect the complex political landscape and the pressures of balancing economic development with environmental sustainability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tax bill, including a tax on remittances leaving the US, is expected to significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a crucial source of income for many African families, often outweighing aid and foreign direct investment. The tax, initially proposed at 5% and later reduced to 3.5%, is likely to affect lower-income groups who rely on financial transfers from relatives working abroad. Experts predict that migrants may seek unofficial channels to evade the tax, potentially disrupting the flow of vital funds to African economies.</p>
