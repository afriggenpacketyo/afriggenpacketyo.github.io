          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned Israeli authorities for denying entry to Labour MPs Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, calling the decision unacceptable and counterproductive. Israeli officials stated the MPs were barred due to intentions to spread hateful rhetoric. Lammy has communicated his concerns to the Israeli government and offered support to the affected MPs. This incident raises concerns about diplomatic relations and freedom of movement for elected officials, particularly those critical of Israeli policies.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans have reportedly canceled a private workout with Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, fueling speculation about their top draft pick. Cam Ward is now considered the frontrunner, while Sanders' draft stock may be declining. The Titans attended Sanders' pro day and have scouted him extensively, but the cancellation suggests they may be leaning towards Ward. Sanders, along with Travis Hunter, played a significant role in revitalizing the Buffaloes football program.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has placed an attorney, Erez Reuveni, on indefinite paid leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a case involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

          <p>UK newspapers are dominated by two major stories: Prime Minister Starmer's response to Donald Trump's tariff blitz and the arrest of Labour MP Dan Norris.

Norris's arrest involves allegations of rape, child sex offenses, child abduction, and misconduct in public office, leading to his suspension from the Labour party.

The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas but has not provided evidence, promising a thorough examination of the incident while the Red Crescent calls for an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>The US began collecting a 10% tariff on all imports as President Donald Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" after market turmoil. The UK and France are among hundreds of countries impacted, and its leaders have said nothing is off the table. China, which has been hit the hardest by President Trump's tariffs, announced a significant retaliatory response. Trump described the market volatility as "an economic revolution", which the US "will win". Billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, said the US and Europe could move towards a "zero-tariff situation".</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner met with Birmingham council leaders to address the ongoing bin strike and discuss ways to clear the waste backlog. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident due to industrial action by Unite union members over pay.

          <p>Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and advisor to President Trump, expressed his hope for a "zero-tariff situation" between the United States and Europe. Speaking at a conference in Florence, Italy, Musk suggested creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America. His comments come as the Trump administration introduces tariffs on goods of up to 50% on countries with trade imbalances with the US, with the EU facing a 20% levy. Musk has been working to reduce U.S. public spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).</p>

          <p>USC guard Wesley Yates III, who showed significant promise as a freshman, has entered the transfer portal after less than a year at the university. Yates' departure is a blow to USC's backcourt plans, as he was expected to play a key role alongside point guard Desmond Claude and incoming prospect Alijah Arenas. Despite expressing his intention to return, Yates' situation changed, and he will now explore opportunities elsewhere. Virginia big man Jacob Cofie has committed to USC.</p>

          <p>With America reeling from the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on around 180 countries, a conservative organization has filed a lawsuit challenging an initial round of tariffs the president announced in February on Chinese imports. The New Civil Liberties Alliance ( NCLA ) argues that Mr Trump lacked the authority to impose these levies. Similar lawsuits against the broader tariff blitz of April 2nd could yet scuttle the boldest—and most destructive—move of Mr Trump’s second term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, in its deportation campaign against Venezuelan immigrants, has relied on tattoos to identify members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but the tattoos are being misinterpreted. Examples of TDA tattoos provided by the U.S. government include art by artists in the UK and India that have innocent meanings. The tattoos include art honoring the birth of a child, while another appears to commemorate the Aussie rock band AC/DC. The Independent has found that the U.S. government’s examples of TDA tattoos, created under the Biden administration, include art by artists in the UK and India, who say the tattoos they etched had innocent meanings.</p>
