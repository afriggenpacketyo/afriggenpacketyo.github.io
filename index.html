          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender female doctor. Peggie, who stated she felt "embarrassed and intimidated," is pursuing a separate employment tribunal against the health board, claiming unlawful treatment. This case unfolds amid a broader national debate in Scotland and a recent UK Supreme Court ruling that clarified the definition of a woman as being based on biological sex under the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods group Richemont, owner of Cartier, reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan for its fiscal first quarter, a sharp reversal from last year's significant growth. The downturn is attributed to a strengthening yen, which has reduced spending by tourists, particularly from China. Despite the slump in Japan, the Swiss company's overall revenue increased by 6% to €5.41 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, primarily driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division.

          <p>The England men's cricket team has been fined and docked two World Test Championship points for maintaining a slow over rate during their recent victory against India. The penalty, imposed by the match referee, caused England to drop from second to third in the championship standings. Captain Ben Stokes accepted the ruling, which fines players five percent of their match fee for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time. This is not the first time the team has faced such penalties this year.</p>

          <p>A US- and Israel-backed aid organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has reported that 20 people were killed during a "chaotic and dangerous surge" at one of its distribution sites in Khan Younis.

          <p>Three oil fields in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region were struck by explosive-laden drones, forcing a temporary halt in production. The attacks targeted fields operated by Norway's DNO and a U.S.-headquartered company, Hunt Oil, marking the fifth such incident in a week. While no group has claimed responsibility, security sources suggest the drones originated from areas controlled by Iran-backed militias. The strikes escalate tensions between the regional and central governments over oil exports.</p>

          <p>Ahead of this week's Open Championship, this article revisits the legendary round of golf played by a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy at Royal Portrush in 2005. During the North of Ireland Championship, McIlroy shot a course-record 61, a bogey-free round that signaled his future superstardom. His playing partners from that day recall how the crowd swelled as word spread of his incredible performance, which included five consecutive birdies to finish. The achievement remains a key moment in the lore of both McIlroy and the historic golf course.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Support for Ukraine is Transactional, Not Strategic</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes President Trump's recent shift in policy toward Ukraine, arguing that his decision to supply anti-missile defense systems is driven by financial transactions rather than a change in strategic thinking. The author contends that Trump was convinced to support Kyiv only after European NATO allies committed to footing the bill, framing Ukrainian independence as a paid service rather than a just cause. The analysis concludes that while the aid is a relief for Ukraine, Trump's support remains unreliable and contingent on who is paying.</p>

The retrial, 46 years later, will re-examine whether Kim's actions constituted insurrection, revisiting a pivotal and deeply polarizing moment in the nation's history as it grapples with contemporary questions about democratic stability.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, will surge to a record 16 to 17 million metric tons this year. This increased demand is driven by the startup of new ethylene plants and a strategic shift away from U.S. propane and ethane due to trade war-related supply disruptions. This pivot back to naphtha is expected to support Asian refiners' profit margins, as Chinese petrochemical producers seek to diversify their feedstock sources away from politically sensitive U.S. cargoes.
