          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina. The storm's maximum sustained winds have decreased to 35 mph, leading to the discontinuation of all tropical storm warnings. While the immediate threat has lessened, scattered showers, heavy rain, and potential flash flooding remain a concern for inland areas of North and South Carolina. Flood watches are still in effect for several regions, and the system is expected to fully dissipate by Monday, marking the end of the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians, with conflicting casualty reports from various agencies. The strikes targeted multiple locations, including a tent camp for displaced persons. Concurrently, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has strongly criticized a Security Cabinet decision to allow more aid into northern Gaza, claiming it benefits Hamas and creates a rift within the government. This internal political friction occurs as the conflict continues, with the Israeli military stating it struck 130 targets linked to Hamas in the last 24 hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's major policy bill, asserting it will generate 3% economic growth and reduce the deficit, contrary to estimates from the CBO and other organizations. He dismissed critical analyses, citing the past accuracy of White House models and arguing that not passing the bill would trigger a recession. Hassett also addressed upcoming trade deal deadlines, suggesting several agreements will be finalized this week while others may be extended. He also downplayed concerns about potential Medicaid coverage losses, stating the bill's job creation would increase insurance access. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 66 fatalities after the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. The majority of deaths occurred in Kerr County, where a children's summer camp was severely impacted, leaving 11 campers and one counselor missing. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, and rescue operations are ongoing, with officials having conducted over 160 air rescues. The rapid and unpredicted nature of the flood, which saw the river rise 26 feet in 45 minutes, overwhelmed local warning capabilities and caused widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>New York Congressman Tom Suozzi described the new major policy bill as a 'big, ugly bill,' arguing it will significantly harm the country by increasing the national deficit. He warned this would fuel inflation, keep interest rates high, and negatively impact Americans' ability to buy homes and afford healthcare. Suozzi criticized the bill for providing what he sees as unnecessary tax breaks for the wealthy while cutting essential services like Medicaid for vulnerable populations. He also commented on the Democratic party's messaging, urging a stronger focus on economic security to connect with voters' primary concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first British Grand Prix in a chaotic, rain-affected race at Silverstone.

Piastri had led for much of the race but was passed by Norris after serving his penalty during a late pit stop. In a surprising result, Nico Hulkenberg of Sauber secured his first-ever podium finish in his 239th race, holding off Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton to finish third in front of a record crowd.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of vandalism after portraits in a Windrush exhibition in Brixton, south London, were damaged. The outdoor art installation, 'Windrush Untold Stories,' features portraits and first-hand accounts of those who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean. While community groups had claimed the act was driven by racial hatred, the Metropolitan Police stated they do not believe it was a hate crime. Police have been in contact with the exhibition's organizers and sought to reassure the community, which they acknowledged would feel distressed by the incident.</p>

          <p>A Grand Forks man is facing multiple felony charges after law enforcement reportedly discovered significant quantities of illegal drugs in his impounded vehicle. Authorities allege that a search of the 42-year-old's car yielded over 1.5 pounds of methamphetamine, half a pound of marijuana, and 11.5 grams of cocaine. The man faces a Class A felony charge for possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. His bond was set at $100,000, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for August.</p>

Chernow notes that themes in Twain's work, such as politics, race, and class, remain highly relevant today. The piece highlights Twain's evolution on race, culminating in his anti-slavery masterpiece 'Huckleberry Finn,' solidifying his legacy as a vital and enduring voice in American culture.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the push to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as 'shortsighted' and 'misguided.' He argues that the perception of public media as a left-wing entity is flawed, as its services are crucial for rural areas where PBS may be the only available broadcast signal. Burns emphasized that public broadcasting provides essential children's programming, continuing education, and emergency information. He stated that his own extensive, long-term documentary projects would not be possible without the unique support system provided by PBS, which he likened to a foundational American institution.</p>

After months of talks, Brussels is now aiming for a 'framework deal' similar to the one the UK secured, conceding that a comprehensive agreement is unattainable.

The announcement drew interest from fellow billionaire Mark Cuban and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a vital trading hub, connecting ancient communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. The finding is important for understanding the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, which was decimated by climate change. Excavations at the site, which began eight years ago, have revealed 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, along with ceremonial objects and sculptures, shedding new light on this period of ancient history.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty, originally conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, has transformed over time into a powerful symbol of immigration. Initially, the statue had no connection to immigration, but poet Emma Lazarus's sonnet 'The New Colossus' reimagined it as a 'mother of exiles.' The opening of the nearby Ellis Island immigration facility in 1892 solidified this new meaning. The article traces how historical events, including restrictive 1920s immigration quotas and their eventual repeal in 1965, have shaped both the country's demographics and the enduring promise embodied by the iconic statue.</p>

This erosion of legal and moral standards is also seen domestically, as universities and governments in the West are accused of suppressing pro-Palestinian dissent by rewriting rules on free speech.

A key example is the new grand mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, which gives Turkey influence over the institution. This religious outreach is part of a broader geopolitical strategy that includes Turkish companies leading major construction projects for railways, ports, and buildings across the region.
