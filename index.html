          <p>Among the victims of the catastrophic Central Texas floods were Dallas sisters Blair Harber, 13, and Brooke Harber, 11. The girls, who were staying with their grandparents near the Guadalupe River, were found together 15 miles downriver, a testament to their close bond even in their final moments. The tragedy has deeply affected their school and church community, where they were remembered as faithful, kind, and energetic students involved in numerous activities. Their deaths are part of a wider disaster that has claimed over 100 lives, including many children at a nearby summer camp, prompting a massive ongoing search and recovery operation.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States holds legal responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to the CECOT mega-prison. This assertion contradicts the Trump administration's claims that it lacks authority over the detainees, who were transferred under a deal to house alleged gang members. El Salvador's report states its role was limited to providing prison infrastructure, with jurisdiction remaining with U.S. authorities. The disclosure emerged from a U.N. investigation into the disappearance of four Venezuelan men and has led to accusations that the U.S. government withheld crucial information from the courts.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 104 deaths, with dozens of people, including campers from a girls' summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and leading to a massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, as officials grapple with the scale of the tragedy and the challenges of the ongoing recovery efforts. The event has been described as a "mass casualty event," with the death toll expected to rise as search operations continue.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly condemned recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles as proof of President Trump's "polluted heart," while simultaneously requesting billions in federal aid for wildfire recovery. This places Newsom in the difficult position of criticizing the administration he is asking for help from. He argued that the raids could disrupt the state's construction workforce, which is vital for rebuilding, and called the timing intentionally cruel. Despite the political friction, Newsom expressed confidence that Congress would provide the necessary disaster funding for California, as well as for other states like Texas, emphasizing that such aid should be a nonpartisan issue.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Central Texas was triggered by an extreme rainfall event where some areas received over 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend.

This caused the Guadalupe River to rise an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming the flood-prone Texas Hill Country. The article explains the specific meteorological factors and geographical vulnerabilities that led to the rapid and deadly inundation, with forecasters warning of potential for additional rainfall in the already devastated region.</p>

          <p>A legislative amendment has been proposed in the UK to make at least ten Premier League football games, along with several key finals, available on free-to-air television each season. Tabled by the Liberal Democrats as part of the Football Governance Bill, the proposal aims to tear down the "paywall" that keeps top-flight matches behind expensive subscription services. Proponents argue this would give the Premier League back to the country, similar to a law in Spain that requires one free La Liga game per week.

          <p>The UK government will conduct another nationwide test of its emergency alert system, sending a message to all compatible smartphones at 3:00 PM BST on September 7. The system, designed to warn of imminent dangers like extreme weather or terror attacks, will cause phones to vibrate and emit a siren sound. This second test follows a 2023 trial that revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving the alert. The government aims to ensure the system's reliability and familiarize the public with it, while domestic abuse charities have reiterated concerns about the potential risk to victims with hidden phones.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in the Grays Ferry neighborhood of Philadelphia resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries early Monday morning.

The victims, including two juveniles who are expected to survive, were transported to local hospitals. Authorities have one person in custody and believe a weapon modified for automatic fire was used in the incident, which marks a violent end to the July Fourth holiday weekend in the city.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 18 states, led by California, has filed a legal challenge against the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. The states argue that federal agents have conducted "suspicionless" stops, violating constitutional rights and creating a culture of fear that harms public safety and prosperity. The filing supports a lawsuit by advocacy groups, seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the operations, which have allegedly detained individuals, including U.S. citizens, based on little more than their appearance. This legal action escalates the conflict between state governments and the federal administration over aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions.</p>

The proposal was a family affair, with Ozzy jokingly telling Wilson to "F— off" before he could ask, drawing laughter from the gathered family and friends. Wilson then proposed, and a visibly shocked Kelly accepted. The couple, who have known each other for over two decades, welcomed a son together in late 2022. Their relationship developed from a long-standing friendship that began when Slipknot toured with the Osbourne family's Ozzfest tour many years ago.</p>

          <p>A recent incident at Wimbledon, where an electronic line-calling system failed, has reignited the debate over human trust in sports technology. Despite systems like Hawk-Eye being demonstrably more accurate than the human eye, players and fans often express frustration when technology errs, highlighting a deep-seated tension between machine perfection and human context. Experts suggest this distrust stems from a collective sense of fairness and a feeling of lost agency when machines officiate. The article explores how this dynamic plays out not just in tennis but also in football with VAR, questioning whether the pursuit of technological perfection removes a necessary element of human imperfection from sports.</p>

The environmental group GreenRoots, in partnership with the city, has planted over 100 trees, resurfaced streets with lighter colors, and painted rooftops white to reflect heat rather than absorb it. This urban laboratory aims to provide a template for other cities as climate change intensifies heat waves. Researchers are working with residents to track heat exposure, demonstrating how targeted green infrastructure can effectively lower temperatures and improve living conditions in vulnerable urban areas.</p>

The announcement, detailed in a two-page memo, comes after President Trump promised to release files on the case, a promise some supporters feel has not been fulfilled.
