          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. His legal team, led by Patrick Fitzgerald, intends to challenge the lawfulness of the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the U.S. Attorney who presented the case to the grand jury. Comey's attorneys also plan to file motions alleging grand jury abuse and outrageous government conduct, arguing that the prosecution is vindictive and selective. The judge set a trial date for January 5, expressing a desire for a speedy resolution, while Comey maintains his innocence and anticipates a trial to prove it. Optimism for Comey is at a reasonable score.</p>

          <p>California's proposed redistricting plan, Proposition 50, is a major point of contention among candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race. The plan, backed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats, a move framed as a countermeasure to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas. While Democratic candidates generally support the proposition, some express unease about the partisan implications. Republican and Green Party candidates strongly oppose the plan, arguing that it undermines the independence of the redistricting commission and consolidates power within the Democratic party, the stakes are high as the redistricting plan could significantly alter California's representation in Congress through 2028.</p>

          <p>During a public appearance in Los Angeles, former Vice President Kamala Harris criticized the current political climate. While promoting her new book, Harris remarked that "these motherf---ers are crazy," seemingly taking a shot at the Trump administration. She emphasized the importance of telling the story of the 2024 election from her perspective. Her remarks sparked controversy, with White House spokesman Kush Desai responding with a jab at Harris's laugh. The former Vice President's book tour has included claims that the most recent presidential election was the "closest" this century.</p>

          <p>Former captain Steven Gerrard and other players from England's so-called 'Golden Generation' reflect on their failure to achieve major tournament success, citing issues such as club rivalries, egotism, and tactical shortcomings. Despite boasting a squad of highly talented players, England consistently underperformed on the international stage. Tactical inflexibility and the inability to integrate players from rival clubs contributed to their lack of cohesion as a team. While other nations also possessed great players, England struggled to overcome internal divisions and injury problems, ultimately falling short of expectations.</p>

          <p>Top US envoys and regional figures are participating in the third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt, aiming to end the ongoing war in Gaza. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, along with Qatar's prime minister and Turkey's intelligence chief, have joined the negotiations. Hamas has reportedly submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants Israel to release in exchange for hostages held in Gaza, expressing "the necessary positivity" in the negotiations. However, disagreements persist over key issues such as withdrawal maps and the hostage-prisoner exchange, with both sides interpreting Trump's peace plan differently.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges in Virginia, in a case pursued by the Trump administration. The charges include making a false statement and obstruction of a congressional proceeding during his 2020 Senate committee testimony. Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, has asserted that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. Attorney, was unlawful, and plans to file motions addressing grand jury abuse and government misconduct. The trial is set to begin on January 5, with the defense arguing that the case is simple and does not involve complex or classified information.</p>

          <p>Despite the reinstatement of UN sanctions, Iran continues to ship oil around the world by circumventing international regulations. The Iranian regime has developed a shadow financial and shipping network to facilitate oil trading, with the US government imposing sanctions on individuals, companies, and ships tied to the Iranian oil industry. China remains a major buyer of Iranian oil, using a clandestine barter system where Iranian oil is exchanged for Chinese infrastructure projects in Iran.

UNICEF reports that at least 61,000 children have been killed or maimed since the war started. Many children have been orphaned and are now living in makeshift camps, taking on adult responsibilities. The UN estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population has been forcibly displaced, leading to increased suffering and trauma. One in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, and the trauma being inflicted is not just physical, but also emotional and psychological.</p>

The central bank noted that equity market valuations are near all-time highs, partly due to strong earnings by U.S. tech firms. The market share of the top 5 members of the S&P 500 is higher than at any point in the past 50 years, increasing the market's exposure to any pullback on AI-related bets, this is not investment advice.</p>
