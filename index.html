        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rayan Cherki, a product of Lyon's youth academy, is drawing attention from Manchester City due to his exceptional technical skills and versatility on the field. At 16, he became Lyon's youngest goalscorer and has since showcased his talent in Ligue 1 with impressive assist numbers and dribbling abilities. Praised by football figures like Thierry Henry and Alexandre Lacazette, Cherki's ambidextrous nature and ability to play both as a winger and central attacking midfielder make him a sought-after prospect, further solidifying his reputation with a notable international debut for France. He is considered one of the greatest technicians in Europe right now. Optimism for the future remains. </p>

          <p>Following violent clashes between protesters and authorities over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, President Trump has deployed National Guard troops to the city. Approximately 300 National Guard soldiers are currently stationed at key locations to protect federal property and personnel, while Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has threatened to deploy active-duty Marines if violence escalates. The protests erupted after ICE agents detained over 40 individuals for alleged immigration law violations, leading to demonstrations and clashes with law enforcement, with officials on both sides trading accusations regarding the response to the unrest. The situation remains tense as local and federal authorities attempt to manage the ongoing protests and ensure public safety.</p>

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned Moran's remarks and called for action from ABC, highlighting the sensitivity of news organizations to criticism from the Trump administration. The suspension underscores the pressure networks face to maintain neutrality amid heightened political tensions and Trump's history of retaliating against perceived critics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has sparked controversy and debate. Despite the LAPD stating that the protests were largely peaceful, Trump administration officials claimed that immigration agents were being targeted and local law enforcement was too slow to respond. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objections, Trump federalized the National Guard, prompting accusations of infringing on states' rights and escalating tensions. The move has been criticized as a political maneuver intended to appeal to Trump's base, while inflaming tensions within the state.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies four common areas of conflict: tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, often conveyed through tone, is a strong predictor of divorce. Misalignments regarding family support and clashes in parenting values also lead to arguments. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication, marked by defensiveness or stonewalling, further contribute to relationship strife. Addressing these conflicts requires acknowledging each partner's feelings, redistributing responsibilities, and establishing strategies for effective communication, such as using a designated "time-out" signal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's swift deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests reflects a more aggressive use of executive power, raising concerns about states' rights and the proportionality of his actions. Local officials expressed opposition to federal intervention, fearing it could escalate tensions, while the administration defended its response as necessary to address lawlessness. The move has been interpreted as a political strategy to target a Democratic city in a Democratic state, with Vice President JD Vance characterizing the anti-ICE protesters as "insurrectionists." The situation underscores the ongoing tensions between the federal government and local authorities regarding immigration enforcement and the handling of protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles amid immigration protests is viewed by critics as a tactic to redirect dissent and rally his base. By focusing on an "enemy within," Trump aims to divert attention from policy failures and his feud with Elon Musk. The move is reminiscent of his response to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with concerns raised about the potential for authoritarian overreach. As California becomes a target for Trump's base, the absence of moderating influences within his administration raises fears of further escalation and the use of military force against civilian protests.</p>

          <p>BowFlex is recalling millions of its adjustable dumbbells after receiving over 100 reports of injuries caused by weight plates dislodging during use. The recalled dumbbells, including the BowFlex 552 and 1090 models, were sold in pairs and as single units. Johnson Health Tech Retail, which acquired BowFlex assets after its bankruptcy, will offer refunds or replacement units to customers who purchased the dumbbells from them. Consumer Reports has criticized the company's remedy as insufficient, advocating for full refunds without conditions. The company said that the recall is to ensure the safety of consumers.</p>
