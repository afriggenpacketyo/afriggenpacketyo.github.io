          <h2>Nigeria Experiences Decade-High Growth Amid Persistent Poverty and Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a recent World Bank report, Nigeria's GDP saw a 3.4% increase in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in a decade, primarily fueled by the recovering oil and gas sector and advancements in technology and finance. However, the report also cautioned that poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living below the poverty line, making it the country with the world's second-largest poor population after India. The agricultural sector is experiencing slow growth due to insecurity and high input costs, contributing to inflation, which is expected to remain above 20% throughout the year, impacting the purchasing power of ordinary Nigerians. President Tinubu's reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, are seen as positive steps but have resulted in a cost-of-living crisis for many citizens.</p>

          <p>Douglas "Pete" Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam, discusses his journey from captivity to becoming the first postwar U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. After being shot down and held for six and a half years, Peterson made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind and contribute to reconciliation between the two nations. He recounts his initial reluctance to take on the ambassadorship, fearing it would cause further issues, but found that his experience as a POW and congressman helped him build trust with Vietnamese diplomats. Peterson also highlights his work in improving safety for children in Asia through The Alliance for Safe Children, focusing on preventing accidental injuries and death.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs, fueled by factors like unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical tensions, and rising inflationary pressures. Investors are increasingly viewing gold as a safe haven asset, leading to a surge in demand for physical gold and Exchange Traded Funds. Central banks have also been significant buyers, seeking to diversify their reserves amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty and fears of weaponization of the dollar system. While some experts predict further price increases, others warn of a potential market bubble, drawing parallels to past surges followed by significant price corrections (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flight delays, with some flights delayed by up to seven hours, due to a critical shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark's air traffic. The FAA acknowledged the staffing issues, stating that at least three controllers were scheduled per hour, though sources indicated that the number of fully certified controllers was sometimes as low as one or two, far below the target of 14. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the problems to the Biden administration's handling of the move of Newark's air traffic management from Long Island to Philadelphia, as well as antiquated equipment and technology. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby reassured customers that flights to and from Newark are safe, while the FAA plans to reduce the number of flights at the airport to mitigate delays.</p>

          <p>Doctors and researchers are grappling with the question of who should be prescribed GLP-1 drugs, given their effectiveness in inducing weight loss but also their high cost, potential side effects, and the need for lifelong use. The article argues that the primary goal should be improving health, not just achieving weight loss, and that GLP-1 drugs are most beneficial for individuals with excess visceral fat who are experiencing its negative health consequences. Physicians should focus on identifying those with high visceral fat through measures like waist size and blood-lipid patterns, rather than relying solely on BMI. The article emphasizes the need for more data on how to safely discontinue GLP-1 drugs and the importance of considering lifestyle changes and other medications as alternatives.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli citizen held hostage in Gaza, was released by Hamas after more than 19 months, coinciding with President Trump's departure for a trip to the Middle East. Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when abducted during the Hamas-orchestrated attack in October 2023, was transferred to the Red Cross and then to the Israel Defense Forces. Hamas stated that the release was intended to promote a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and to renew humanitarian aid efforts, while Israel maintained that it did not commit to any ceasefire or the release of terrorists.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to require drugmakers to lower their prices to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening steep caps on Medicare earnings if they do not comply. He stated that the U.S. would no longer subsidize the healthcare of foreign countries and that some drug prices could be reduced by 50% to 90%. The proposal builds on his previous "most favored nation" concept, aiming to pay the lowest price available globally. The drug industry has opposed this approach, calling it "importing socialized medicine" and arguing it would harm innovation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Episcopal church's migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing the church's longstanding "commitment to racial justice and reconciliation." Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe announced the step, stating that the church will halt its decades-long partnership with the government. The decision comes in response to the Trump administration's decision to open a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, which the Episcopal church views as preferential treatment over other refugees who have been waiting for years.</p>

          <p>Although the EPA did not release its annual greenhouse gas emissions report, data obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund reveals that while the U.S. has reduced its most potent greenhouse gas emissions, it is not on track to meet its climate goals. The report, which examines data from 1990-2023, found that gross greenhouse gas emissions dropped about 17% since 2005, but a reduction of 61-66% is needed by 2035. Concerns are rising that policies from the Trump administration will disincentivize electric vehicles and prioritize fossil fuels over renewable energy, potentially reversing progress made in those areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar by invoking an anecdote about golfer Sam Snead, comparing the situation to accepting a gimme putt in golf. He argued that it would be "stupid" to turn down the gift, despite ethical concerns. This is an insight into how Mr. Trump views not only the plane but all the other ethical concerns swirling around him, including his family's business dealings and cryptocurrency ventures. The analogy reveals Mr. Trump's view of the world as a golf course, where only a fool would decline an advantage.</p>

          <p>House Republicans unveiled plans for a far-reaching tax bill that would enact President Trump's campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, roll back clean energy subsidies, and create a new tax-advantaged investment account for children. The bill extends several provisions from Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax law, including lower marginal income tax rates and a larger standard deduction. To offset the costs, Republicans propose tax hikes on President Biden's agenda, universities, and migrants. The legislation is expected to add at least $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the US and Japan are competing to discover why the universe exists by studying neutrinos, sub-atomic particles, and their antimatter opposites. The US-based Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) involves building vast underground caverns to shield sensitive equipment from external noise and radiation. As they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly, and scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The Japanese-led Hyper K experiment, an upgraded version of the existing Super K detector, is expected to begin operating sooner, providing an earlier opportunity for discoveries.</p>
