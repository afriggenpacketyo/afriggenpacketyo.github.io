          <p>Germany is experiencing a resurgence of its peace movement, marked by large protests against wars in Ukraine and Gaza, with over 10,000 gathering in Berlin demanding peace negotiations and an end to arms deliveries. Sahra Wagenknecht, a prominent politician, is leading the movement, emphasizing the need to address both the conflict in Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Critics, however, accuse Wagenknecht of fueling hatred towards Israel, while others believe the movement lacks a unified goal compared to past peace movements. Despite fragmentation, resistance is growing, with major demonstrations planned for German Reunification Day, signaling a potential turning point against militarism. The movement is fueled by concerns over compulsory military service and a growing sentiment against war. The current pacifist movement may find traction with the general public. Optimism rests in the ability for the movement to mobilize. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NPR has filed a lawsuit against the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) over its decision to award a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium, Public Media Infrastructure (PMI), for operating the public radio satellite system, a system NPR has managed for over four decades. The lawsuit reveals tensions within public media as federal funding wanes due to Republican efforts, with NPR alleging that CPB's decision was influenced by the Trump administration's animosity towards NPR. NPR claims that CPB reversed its earlier commitment to extend NPR's contract, and is now bending to political pressure. The move threatens NPR's relationships with interconnected stations and undermines trust built over decades. CPB defends its decision as serving the best interests of public radio's future, but NPR views the situation as a regrettable end to decades of collaboration. </p>

The Keele family, who lost their home in the storm, is currently living in a donated camper and relying on the generosity of volunteers and nonprofit organizations. Despite the challenges, they express gratitude for the support they have received, including a new car, generators, and assistance with clearing out their damaged home. The family's resilience is symbolized by a wooden sign that survived the flood, reminding them to adjust to their current circumstances. The people of North Carolina are showing resilience in their recovery. </p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the EU to improve public finances, proposing an exchange scheme for young workers aged 18 to 30 for a two-year stay without the right to remain. Reeves has called for the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor in the potential economic impact of the scheme in its forecasts ahead of the budget, hoping to reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises. The proposal has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement. The OBR will send its first economic forecast to the treasury on Friday, which will include the gap the chancellor will need to make up in her 26 November Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations is set to reimpose economic and military sanctions on Iran after accusing the country of failing to fulfill its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. The sanctions include an arms embargo, a ban on uranium enrichment, and a freeze of assets, adding strain to already fraught relations between Iran and Western powers. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the reimposition of sanctions as unfair, and stated that Iran would need reassurances that its nuclear facilities would not be attacked by Israel in order to normalize its nuclear enrichment program. The sanctions will come into force first at the UN, followed by the EU. The UN is trying to maintain order in a chaotic world. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic with false statements that its voting machines helped rig the 2020 presidential election, but deferred the question of whether Lindell acted with "actual malice." The judge said there were 51 specific times when Lindell falsely claimed that Smartmatic interfered with the results of the 2020 election in California's Los Angeles County. Smartmatic attorney Erik Connolly said they will be seeking "nine-figure damages" from Lindell and MyPillow for "spreading lies" about the company. Lindell vowed to keep fighting until its voting machines are "melted down and turned into prison bars." The case is continuing to be investigated. </p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces scrutiny after producing curious pairings for the Saturday morning foursomes at Bethpage, despite Europe winning both sessions on Friday. Bradley has retained Collin Morikawa and Harris English, as well as Russell Henley and Scottie Scheffler, despite their losses. Bradley hinted that his decision was influenced by the players' eagerness to get back out on the course. The European captain Luke Donald has retained the foursomes pairings from a 3-1 session win, changing only their order. The American players struggled on Bethpage’s greens on day one; it would be no shock if they are speeded up for Ryder Cup Saturday. </p>

          <p>Locals and tribal communities in central and eastern India are caught in a crossfire between Maoist rebels and government security forces. The Maoist insurgency has persisted for nearly six decades, claiming thousands of lives. The Indian government set a March 2026 deadline to end the insurgency and launched intensified security operations. Between January 2024 and September this year, security forces killed more than 600 alleged rebels. Rights activists worry about the human cost of these operations, as Maoist-affected regions remain among India's poorest and most underdeveloped. The conflict is continuing to be investigated. </p>

          <p>Brock Stewart will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, leaving the Dodgers without the only significant deadline addition they made to bolster their struggling bullpen. The Dodgers acquired Stewart at the trade deadline knowing he came with some risk, but their worst-case scenario was realized. The club will have to proceed without him this October. Shoulder problems are nothing new for Stewart, as he made just 16 appearances with the Minnesota Twins before undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery in August. The Dodgers' right-handed relief hierarchy is somewhat unclear. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump said he expects more of his political enemies to face criminal charges, a day after James Comey was indicted. Trump called his adversaries "corrupt radical left Democrats" and said there would be others facing charges. The indictment against Comey has raised fresh fears that Trump’s political appointees will pursue criminal cases against the president’s other adversaries. Trump has fixated on criminal investigations against Letitia James and Adam Schiff, and the administration has launched a criminal investigation into John Brennan. The U.S. is facing political turmoil. </p>

          <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala expressed confusion and surprise during the court session when James Comey's indictment was returned, asking why there were two versions of the indictment. Vaala noted that one document did not clearly indicate what the grand jury had decided, and that the court session began unusually late. The charges against Comey mark an unprecedented step for the Justice Department, after President Trump publicly urged prosecutors to look into the ex-FBI leader. Before Comey was indicted, staff at the U.S. attorney's office circulated a memo that argued charges should not be brought against the former FBI director. The legal system is facing new challenges. </p>
