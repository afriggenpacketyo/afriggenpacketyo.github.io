          <p>World-renowned battery scientist Guo Zaiping has accepted a new position as chair professor of energy materials at City University of Hong Kong. After two decades in Australia, where she was celebrated for her groundbreaking work at the University of Adelaide, her move marks a significant talent acquisition for the Hong Kong institution. Her research, particularly in advanced materials for energy storage, is considered vital for developing next-generation rechargeable batteries. This work holds the potential to significantly extend the driving range of electric vehicles, revolutionizing the industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning reforms to licensing rules aimed at protecting pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened many establishments. Under the new proposals, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for new businesses would be streamlined. The changes are intended to revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry, which has seen a steady decline in the number of pubs. Critics, however, argue that other government policies are the primary cause of the industry's financial struggles.</p>

          <p>A stampede at the Mansa Devi temple in Haridwar, a holy city in northern India, has resulted in the deaths of at least six people and injured more than a dozen others. The tragic incident reportedly occurred after a high-voltage wire fell onto a crowded path, causing widespread panic among the thousands of devotees gathered at the popular Hindu pilgrimage site. This event is the latest in a series of deadly crowd crushes in India this year, highlighting ongoing safety concerns at large religious gatherings. Authorities have initiated rescue operations and are investigating the precise cause of the panic.</p>

          <p>Iran's judiciary has announced the execution of two men, Mehdi Hassani and Behrouz Ehsani-Eslamloo, for their alleged ties to the exiled militant group Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK). The men were convicted of carrying out attacks on civilian infrastructure and were found guilty of "waging war against God" and other security-related charges. According to the judiciary, they operated a safe house in Tehran where they manufactured projectiles and filmed their activities for MEK-affiliated media. The MEK is designated as a terrorist organization by Iran and opposes the current government from exile.</p>

However, analysts are skeptical that this pressure will bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith, as the Kremlin may be banking on the U.S. being unable to sustain a coherent policy.

The Indian government has acknowledged the problem and is implementing measures, but mental health professionals and advocates are calling for more robust institutional changes.

          <p>The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have announced the formation of a rival, civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. The formation of this parallel government is based on an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular "New Sudan." UN officials have warned this could further fragment the country and undermine peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly intervened in the border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, stating that he pressed both leaders for an immediate ceasefire. In a social media post, Trump claimed both nations agreed to meet and work towards peace, a development both countries have acknowledged positively. However, shelling reportedly continued after the calls, and Thailand maintains its position that dialogue must precede a formal ceasefire. The intervention comes just before new U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect, with Trump linking future trade talks to a cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>Turkey has recorded its highest temperature ever, hitting 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This new record comes as a severe heatwave grips much of the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures soaring up to 12 degrees Celsius above seasonal averages. The extreme heat, combined with dry conditions and strong winds, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across the country, forcing evacuations in several provinces, including the popular resort city of Antalya. President Erdogan has described the situation as a "truly great disaster," with thousands of personnel battling the blazes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Boston Red Sox 4-2, despite taking an early lead with home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Dodgers starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw struggled to maintain the advantage, giving up three runs in the second inning and another in the fifth. While Boston's pitcher Garrett Crochet settled down after a rocky start to strike out 10 batters, Kershaw couldn't find his rhythm and exited after just 4.2 innings. The Dodgers' offense was unable to rally, and several risky baserunning decisions failed to pay off, sealing the frustrating loss.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially designated "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's low-altitude economy. This emerging sector, which includes both manned and unmanned aerial activities below 1,000 meters, has been identified by Beijing as a strategic industry for driving innovation and job creation. The new role involves planning complex flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. The designation highlights the increasing demand for skilled professionals to support industries like aerial logistics, surveying, and performance art.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 4,000 NASA employees have chosen to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program, representing about 20% of its total workforce. This significant reduction is part of a broader Trump administration plan to shrink the federal government, based on recommendations from the Department of Government Efficiency. The departures come as the administration has also proposed a 24% budget cut for the agency for fiscal year 2026. The substantial loss of experienced personnel raises concerns among scientists and space organizations about the future of NASA's programs and its ability to maintain its leadership in space exploration.</p>
