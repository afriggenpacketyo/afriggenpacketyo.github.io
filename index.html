          <h2>Pakistan Airspace Closure Impacts Indian Airline Routes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 00:49:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's airspace closure to Indian airlines is causing carriers to reroute flights between India and destinations in Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East, leading to longer and more expensive journeys. Some flights may require refueling stops or face cancellation, with IndiGo suspending flights to Almaty and Tashkent. The closure stems from heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following a deadly attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which India blames on Pakistani militants. While Indian airlines face challenges competing with airlines that can still fly over Pakistan, experts suggest the airspace closure may not significantly increase airfares.</p>

          <p>North Korea has confirmed for the first time that it deployed troops to Russia to assist in its war against Ukraine, claiming the deployment was to help Russia reclaim the Kursk region. The North Korean government stated that this action was taken under a mutual defense treaty signed with Russia in June 2024, and that North Korean soldiers fought alongside Russia, demonstrating "high professionalism, showed fortitude, courage and heroism in battle." However, South Korean officials estimate that thousands of North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in the conflict, and the South Korean government has urged North Korea to withdraw its troops immediately.</p>

          <p>Japan and Vietnam have agreed to enhance their security cooperation through a new vice-ministerial-level dialogue and collaboration on defense equipment and technology.

The US military says it will continue to increase pressure until Houthi attacks on vessels are halted.

This comes amid reports of other U.S. citizen children being deported with their parents, including a child with Stage 4 cancer, though Homan claims he is unaware of that specific case.

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency, of lying to the country’s Supreme Court. This accusation is the latest development in a legal battle over Netanyahu’s attempt to fire Bar. The accusations stem from affidavits submitted by both Netanyahu and Bar, with Bar alleging that his removal was due to a lack of personal loyalty rather than professional reasons. The case was brought by Israeli watchdog organizations and opposition parties challenging Netanyahu's decision.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder the wind energy industry, a "repowering" era has begun as aging wind farms are upgraded with new technology. This repowering activity is boosting market leaders like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, which are seeing revenue increases. Operators are replacing older turbines with more efficient models that can increase electricity output by up to 50%. The repowering of existing wind farms presents economic benefits, including no need to acquire property and potentially fewer turbines needed, delivering higher output at a lower cost.</p>

          <p>Chubby Checker, known for "The Twist", will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, along with Joe Cocker, the White Stripes, Outkast, Cyndi Lauper, Bad Company and Soundgarden. The induction ceremony will take place on November 8th in Los Angeles. Checker has been campaigning for decades to be admitted to the pantheon. The White Stripes, known for their minimalist garage rock, could bring some drama to the ceremony, as Meg White has become one of the great recluses of 21st-century pop.</p>
