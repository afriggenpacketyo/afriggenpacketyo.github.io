          <p>Thirteen security guards kidnapped from a major Peruvian gold mine were found dead, according to the mining company La Poderosa. The company blamed the abduction on informal miners allegedly linked to criminal gangs who ambushed the gold mine. La Poderosa stated that criminal groups fighting for control of the mine have killed 39 of the company's workers since 1980. The company also noted the increasing violence in the area despite a declared state of emergency and police presence.</p>

Those arguments — imported from Europe and translated to the American context — have risen to greater prominence now than at any time since the 1930s.
