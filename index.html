          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, exceeding market expectations. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amid global challenges as reasons for the move. While India's GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter was better than expected at 7.4%, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, a slowdown from the previous year. With limited room for further monetary policy support, the RBI will shift its stance to "neutral" and carefully assess incoming data to balance growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese producers are offering steep discounts due to overcapacity and weak domestic demand, leading to a potential "China shock" for global markets. While this situation raises concerns about squeezing local industries in Asia, economists suggest it could also provide a silver lining by easing inflationary pressures in other economies. Emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may prompt more rate cuts across Asia, with Nomura predicting further easing by central banks in the region. Cheap Chinese imports could help countries like Australia manage their cost-of-living crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's new travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has been met with concern but less shock compared to his initial ban in 2017. Since his second term began, Trump has implemented numerous immigration restrictions, including suspending the asylum system and ending temporary legal residency for thousands. Experts say the new ban is likely to face legal challenges and will disproportionately affect those seeking refuge. Critics argue that the administration is targeting nations with specific religious affiliations and people of color, normalizing restrictive immigration policies.</p>

Yusuf's departure highlights the challenge of hiring staff who can help turn the party into an election-winning machine.

          <p>Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, has criticized the medical and food systems for corruption and conflicts of interest. However, Means herself has promoted health and wellness products, sometimes without disclosing her financial ties to those companies. Experts raise concerns about these entanglements, questioning whether Means' recommendations are influenced by the wellness industry. The nomination has also raised questions about whether Means' company, Levels, could benefit from the administration's health guidance.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, hinted at initiating emergency rice imports if the government cannot bring down prices, emphasizing that there should be no "sacred cows" in agricultural policy. The government is already releasing rice reserves to lower prices, aiming to leave stockpiles at 300,000 tons. Koizumi stated that emergency rice imports are one of the options to ease concerns over distribution shortages and achieve price stability. The government is also aiming to boost production and support producers in response to soaring rice prices.</p>

          <p>Opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill in England and Wales is growing among Members of Parliament (MPs), with several previously supportive or abstaining MPs now likely to vote against it. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die. Concerns about protecting the vulnerable and ensuring safeguards against coercion have led to the shift in opinion. Some MPs believe the bill crosses "red lines" and are concerned about pressure on individuals who feel like a burden.</p>

          <p>Ispace, a private lunar lander company from Japan, declared its mission a failure after its lander crashed while attempting a touchdown on the moon. Communications ceased shortly before the scheduled landing, despite the descent initially appearing successful. This marks the second lunar strikeout for ispace, whose first moonshot also ended in a crash landing. A preliminary analysis suggests that the laser system for measuring altitude malfunctioned, causing the lander to descend too quickly.</p>
