        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's muted response to the recent conflict between Iran and Israel demonstrates its waning status as a global superpower. The author posits that Moscow's deep involvement in the war in Ukraine has drained its military and financial resources, leaving it unable to provide meaningful support to its traditional allies. Russia's failure to defend Iran, a key partner that has supplied it with drones and missiles, is presented as clear evidence of its declining credibility and strategic overreach on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive legislative package proposed by President Trump, which includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. According to a new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill is projected to increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. The legislation is being advanced through the budget reconciliation process, allowing the majority party to proceed without bipartisan support amid significant Democratic opposition.

          <p>Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles are more likely to induce motion sickness compared to traditional internal combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this phenomenon to the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency movements caused by regenerative braking systems. As EV adoption grows, this issue of passenger comfort and health is becoming a more significant area of focus for automotive engineers and researchers looking for potential technological solutions.</p>
