        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated that the EU needs the additional time to secure a favorable trade agreement with the United States, emphasizing the importance of the EU-US trade relationship. Trump expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations, having previously threatened to increase tariffs due to a perceived unfair trade relationship, but ultimately granted the extension to allow for further discussions to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. This decision provides a window for both sides to continue negotiations and avert a potential trade war. Optimism score is based on the potential for improved trade relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders who were jailed for allegedly rigging interest rates, a decision that could potentially overturn all remaining convictions secured in related criminal trials. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for manipulating Libor and Euribor, benchmarks used to set interest rates on mortgages and loans. Evidence has emerged suggesting that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct, raising concerns that the traders were scapegoated. Senior politicians are calling for a public inquiry into the larger issue of interest rate rigging orchestrated by central banks and governments. The ruling could have significant implications for the financial industry and raise questions about the fairness of the prosecutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mosaic that once adorned one of Emperor Caligula's extravagant party ships in the first century A.D. resurfaced as a coffee table in a Park Avenue apartment. The ships were sunk after Caligula's assassination and later recovered by Mussolini, only to be destroyed in World War II. The mosaic's journey from Lake Nemi to Manhattan involved theft, rediscovery by an Italian marble expert, and eventual seizure by the Manhattan district attorney's office. The mosaic has since been cleaned and put on display at Nemi's Museum of the Roman Ships, marking the end of its unusual journey.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the US and the EU have agreed to postpone the imposition of tariffs until July to negotiate a trade deal. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested an extension to reach a "good deal." Trump had previously threatened to impose 50% tariffs on goods entering the US from the EU, citing frustration with negotiations. This postponement provides an opportunity for both sides to engage in serious negotiations and potentially avert a trade war.</p>

          <p>An expert in child development proposes a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes emotional attunement and creating a safe space for children. This approach focuses on accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents do inner work to understand their own triggers and model healthy communication and repair. The goal is to foster emotional resilience, trust, and connection in children, helping them to thrive.</p>
