          <p>Rescue workers discovered the bodies of five skiers near the Rimpfischhorn mountain in Switzerland, close to the Italian border, after emergency services were alerted to abandoned skis. The prosecutors' office in Canton Valais has initiated investigations to confirm the identities of the deceased. The area, popular among backcountry skiers, saw a similar incident last year when five cross-country skiers were found dead near Zermatt. Air and ground searches led to the discovery of the bodies near the Adlergletscher glacier, a location frequently visited by skiers enjoying the mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>Despite raising concerns about the legality of providing aid to immigrants, the Trump administration has continued to release individuals charged with illegal entry to border shelters. FEMA sent letters to shelters suggesting they might be committing felonies related to smuggling, while ICE continued requesting their services. Shelters in Texas and Arizona have been housing immigrants from various countries, some of whom were previously detained. The situation has created a contradiction, as shelters balance assisting vulnerable populations with potential legal risks, leading some to face financial strain and closure.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order has effectively allowed President Trump to remove high-level officials, raising concerns about the consolidation of power within the executive branch. The decision, made without full briefing or argument, overrules a nearly century-old precedent that protected the independence of expert agencies. The author argues that this action sends a dangerous message to the White House, suggesting that the administration can disregard statutes and court rulings. This move risks undermining the rule of law and emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional boundaries, especially amid other legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's defunding of Voice of America (VOA) has significantly impacted countries like Turkey, where press freedom is increasingly restricted. VOA, a source of uncensored news, was blocked in Turkey in 2022 and has now ceased operations due to the funding cuts. The shutdown is seen as a blow to independent journalism in Turkey, where most media outlets are government-controlled. The closure of VOA has silenced a critical voice for Turkish audiences, especially regarding US-Turkey relations, amid ongoing repression of journalists and media organizations.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 09:37:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emotionally safe parenting emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility for conflicts and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. Practicing this style includes doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair. It's about creating a safe place during emotional storms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward Syria and its new leader has complicated Israel's military strategy, leading to a reduction in Israeli airstrikes. Previously, Israel launched numerous attacks to prevent hostile groups from gaining power and to secure its border. However, Trump's meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara and his plans to lift sanctions have altered the dynamics. This shift has forced Israel to reassess its approach, potentially moving towards de-escalation and dialogue, despite concerns about the new Syrian government's ideology and intentions.</p>

          <p>Starr County, Texas, once a Democratic stronghold, voted Republican for the first time in 132 years in 2024, highlighting a significant political realignment. The shift is attributed to the decline of machine politics and the rise of ideological voting, particularly among working-class Hispanics. The focus on local elections and factionalism created an environment ripe for change, as national polarization began to influence local dynamics.
