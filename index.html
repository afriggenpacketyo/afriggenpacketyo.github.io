          <p>An ongoing Israeli military operation in the West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, raising concerns about potential annexation of the territory. The operation, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has resulted in the destruction of homes and infrastructure, undermining the Palestinian Authority's control. Some Palestinians fear a second nakba, citing the extended Israeli presence and the hard-line government's support for annexation. Israel claims the actions are necessary to restore security and combat militancy, while Palestinians report threats and displacement.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late author Agatha Christie is "teaching" an online writing course, raising ethical questions about the use of AI to resurrect historical figures. While Christie's family has approved the course and maintains that it uses only her own words, some critics argue that it is a deepfake that exploits her image without her consent. The use of AI to create the likeness of deceased individuals is becoming more common, leading to debates about authenticity, consent, and the potential for misrepresentation.</p>

The defense attempted to discredit Hyde's testimony by referencing a past case, but the judge limited the scope of the cross-examination.
