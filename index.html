        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, alongside navigating complex relations with the United States and China. Voters express concerns about the rising cost of living, with staples like bread and eggs becoming significantly more expensive. The two main candidates, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton, have focused on economic issues, with Dutton emphasizing tax cuts on fuel and Albanese highlighting healthcare improvements. However, neither party has presented bold solutions to address the underlying economic pressures, leading to voter dissatisfaction and a potential shift towards independent candidates. Optimism regarding Australia's economic stability has waned due to these persistent issues.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have died in recent violence in Druze-majority areas of Syria, sparked by a blasphemous audio recording and escalating into armed conflict. The violence underscores the fragility of the new Syrian government's control and the complex negotiations with the Druze community regarding their integration into the transitional government and military. Israel has also intervened, bombing areas near Damascus and demanding demilitarization south of the city, further complicating the situation. Druze leaders are divided on how to engage with Damascus, and the community largely rejects Israel's offer of protection, fearing it will fuel damaging opinions about their loyalty to Syria.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. This research, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies effective against neurotoxins found in elapids like cobras and mambas. The antivenom cocktail has shown success in mice, surviving fatal doses from 13 of 19 species, which could lead to a universal antivenom and save thousands of lives.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes several key news items from Kyodo News. A survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe social media platforms should be regulated during elections to combat the spread of misinformation. The Trump administration has proposed a 13% increase in the defense budget to deter China, while also planning significant cuts to nondefense spending. Japan's press freedom ranking has slightly improved but remains the worst among G7 nations due to government pressure on news outlets.

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taiwan is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and mainland China. The museum's director aims for 3.5 million visitors in 2025, but lawmaker Ko Chih-en questions this target, citing a drastic decline in visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. In 2024, the museum recorded 2.87 million visitors, with the largest overseas group coming from South Korea, followed by Japan. Cross-strait relations have deteriorated since the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016, leading to travel restrictions on both sides.</p>

          <p>Rolando Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match, disrupting plans for a Garcia-Devin Haney rematch. Garcia, who had a year-long layoff, struggled with timing and output, landing only 54 punches in the entire fight. Romero's victory earned him the WBA welterweight title and potentially puts him in contention for a fight against Haney. Haney won his fight against Jose Ramirez, but Garcia's defeat casts doubt on the highly anticipated rematch.</p>

          <p>Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., hinted at the possibility of a third impeachment of President Donald Trump during a campaign event as she seeks to become the next governor of New Jersey. Sherrill, who voted for both of Trump's previous impeachments, suggested Democrat-led states could challenge Trump's agenda through federalism and court challenges. Her comments came after Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., filed articles of impeachment against Trump for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors.

          <p>Ryan Garcia's year-long absence from the ring contributed to his defeat against Rolando Romero, who won by unanimous decision in New York.

Romero's strategic approach and effective jab helped him secure the victory and the WBA welterweight title. Garcia acknowledged the impact of his inactivity and mental struggles, while Romero expressed his willingness to face any opponent at 147 pounds. The fight was notable for its low punch output, highlighting the cautious approach of both fighters.</p>

The changes also involve reducing the number of provinces and municipalities, creating a two-tier system of local government.

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods has started to affect the advertising revenue of Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. Temu and Shein, known for their aggressive online advertising, are now subject to higher tariffs, leading to reduced ad spending. Temu has stopped direct shipping from China to the US and is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, while Shein has not yet responded. This shift is expected to significantly impact companies reliant on low-cost goods and aggressive online advertising strategies.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. The project, initially intended as a national monument and unifier, has stalled due to a severe economic crisis and allegations of corruption. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo's pledge to build the cathedral as a personal vow to God sparked criticism, leading to a halt in government funding and the dissolution of the managing agency. The unbuilt cathedral has become a target of the new government's anticorruption initiative, leaving the project's future uncertain.</p>

          <p>Russia lacks a formal, organized effort to account for its missing soldiers in Ukraine, leaving families to fend for themselves with minimal government support. Bereaved families and private organizations report that the Ministry of Defense has no effective system for tracking missing soldiers. Estimates suggest tens of thousands are missing, with many likely abandoned on the battlefield due to logistical challenges and drone warfare. Families face bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of information, leading to anger and desperation. The International Committee of the Red Cross has received 110,000 cases related to missing persons from both sides of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow similar levies on imported cars. The tariffs will affect both domestic and foreign automakers, as many US-made cars rely on imported components. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the measures are expected to drive up car prices, contributing to inflation and potentially harming the auto industry.</p>
