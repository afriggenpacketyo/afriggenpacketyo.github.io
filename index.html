          <p>Hurricane Erick, which had briefly reached Category 4 intensity, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific Coast in Oaxaca as a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 125 mph. The storm is the first Pacific Category 3 hurricane to make landfall over Mexico in June. A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Angel, and while initial reports did not indicate significant damage, heavy rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides in southeastern Guerrero and west-coastal Oaxaca through Friday. The storm formed as a tropical storm earlier in the week and rapidly intensified before making landfall, posing a significant threat to the region. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland, though the risk of flooding and mudslides remains high. </p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a retrial in Massachusetts. The jury convicted her of driving under the influence of alcohol, but acquitted her of the more serious charges after four days of deliberations. The case involved accusations that Read had struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. The timeline of events includes the night of O'Keefe's death in January 2022, Read's arrest, and the subsequent trials filled with courtroom battles over evidence and allegations of witness intimidation, with the first trial ending in a mistrial. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pete Hegseth's office in the Pentagon allegedly requested a passive approach to Juneteenth messaging, according to an email cited by Rolling Stone, amid Donald Trump's broader attack on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the government, including the military. Hegseth has been a vocal proponent of Trump's anti-DEI stance, claiming without evidence that DEI policies put military service members in harm's way. The Pentagon responded to the report by stating that the Department of Defense may engage in activities such as holiday celebrations that build camaraderie and outreach events that directly support the DoD's mission. The order comes as the federal government commemorates Juneteenth, marking the end of slavery in the United States. </p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering military action to disable Iran's nuclear site at Fordo, citing concerns about the rapid production of weapons. He has been briefed on the risks and benefits of such a strike but has not made a final decision, holding off in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. The UK is engaging in active diplomacy to find a resolution, and Trump is aware of ongoing diplomatic efforts involving foreign ministers from several countries. Meanwhile, Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign. </p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, the UK is facing questions about its potential involvement, given its close alliance with the US. While the UK has called for de-escalation and has a diplomatic role to play with its European allies, Israel reportedly did not inform the UK in advance of its attack on Iran, considering it "not a reliable partner". The UK possesses military and strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, and a naval presence in the Gulf, each of which could play a role in the conflict. The Attorney General has advised the UK government that any military involvement needs to be defensive in nature to remain within the law. </p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles restaurants are struggling to regain business despite the recent lifting of a curfew imposed after demonstrations protesting immigration policies. Many storefronts remain boarded up, and restaurants have experienced significant drops in reservations, with some losing up to 80% of their bookings. The curfew, intended to quell chaos, has had a lasting impact on the perception of safety in the area, discouraging diners from visiting. However, there are signs of recovery, with some restaurants reopening and residents expressing support for local businesses, and community leaders urging people to rally behind downtown. </p>

          <p>As a federal appeals court reviews the legality of deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles, immigration enforcement has intensified, marked by faster and more discreet raids by ICE. Advocacy groups report that agents are sometimes in plainclothes or wearing insignia from other federal agencies, creating widespread fear and anxiety in immigrant communities. The Trump administration blames the city's sanctuary policies for the stepped-up raids, while critics argue that the deployment of personnel from multiple federal agencies has created a "peak level of anxiety." A court settlement may require ICE personnel to wear more prominent insignia, but its effect will be limited to ICE employees. </p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, citing ongoing efforts to reach a deal separating TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance. This is the third delay since his inauguration in January, with the previous extension expiring Thursday, as Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support, giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services, citing national security concerns. Trump expressed confidence that China would ultimately approve a deal, reiterating his support for TikTok, where he claims to have been very popular. Despite the delays, some lawmakers are sounding the alarm, urging the administration to enforce the law. </p>

          <p>UNCTAD warns that international investment in 2025 has turned negative due to global trade policy changes, including tariff uncertainty, with downward revisions in most indicators of foreign direct investment (FDI). While there had been modest growth in global investment at the start of the year, trade tensions have led to downward revisions in most indicators of foreign direct investment (FDI). This includes gross domestic product, capital formation, exports of goods and services, foreign exchange, financial market volatility, and investor sentiment. A two-year positive trend in manufacturing investments fueled by manufacturers diversifying their supply chains beyond China has reversed, and between $100 and $200 billion of value in projects is at risk. FDI into developing countries remained stable, though there was a wide spread between winners and losers, and UNCTAD warned that structurally weak and vulnerable economies would be most affected by the current investment downturn.

While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk, including those on non-means tested benefits.

The author suggests strategies for controlling one's response, including laughing off minor offenses, using the prefrontal cortex through practices like meditation, and tuning out offense-making media. The piece also considers how some people may feign offense for personal gain, highlighting the importance of discerning genuine harm from manipulative behavior. </p>

          <p>Zhenhao Zou, a Chinese PhD student, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 24 years after being convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting 10 women in London and China. Judge Rosina Cottage KC described Zou as a "sexual predator" who used a manipulative "charming mask" to hide his crimes, treating the women "callously" and as "sex toys" for his own pleasure. The Metropolitan Police have appealed for potential victims to come forward, as detectives fear he could have targeted dozens more. Zou was convicted of 11 counts of sexual assault, three counts of voyeurism, and other offenses, and the judge stated that he poses a high level of danger due to his distorted thinking. </p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by reflecting on the role quilts may have played in the Underground Railroad, using coded messages to guide runaway enslaved people to freedom. Edmunds learned to sew at age seven and has been making quilts for decades, but it wasn't until 50 years ago that she discovered the hidden language in quilt patterns. While some historians debate the evidence of coded quilts, Edmunds and her daughter believe in their significance, drawing parallels to West African pictographs and symbols used for communication. Edmunds hopes to educate younger generations about the history of the Underground Railroad and the struggles of enslaved people, particularly in light of current efforts to restrict discussions about slavery in schools. </p>

          <p>In Thai culture, spirit houses are small shrines constructed to honor spirits, and strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, is a common offering. The red soda has replaced blood sacrifices in offerings to ghosts, who are believed to have a sweet tooth. Some believe red soda is specifically for the spirit of a deceased boy, Kuman Thong, who can grant wishes. The tradition of spirit houses and offerings originates from animism mixed with Brahmanism, which has integrated into Buddhist beliefs, providing protection, ensuring prosperity, and safeguarding health. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on workplace immigration enforcement could significantly impact industries and states that rely on undocumented workers, including farming, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing. While the White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers, industry leaders warn that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations and lead to inflated food prices. Research suggests that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers, and that the share of undocumented workers is concentrated in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. The situation highlights the complex economic implications of immigration policy. </p>

Powell, whose term ends in May 2026, said the Fed is well-positioned to wait and learn more about the economy before making any policy adjustments.
