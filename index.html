          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir last month, India launched strikes on what it claims were terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's military reported that the Indian missile strikes resulted in at least 26 fatalities and 46 injuries, denouncing it as an attack targeting civilian areas, and announced a retaliatory attack shooting down five Indian aircraft. The Indian Defense Ministry stated the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, targeting the roots of cross-border terror planning while avoiding Pakistani military facilities. The UN Secretary General has called for restraint from both countries. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>Brendan Buck argues that congressional Republicans are facing a developing economic trap due to President Trump's tariffs, which could overshadow the benefits of a proposed tax cut package. The article suggests that Republicans are banking on extending the 2017 tax law to calm markets, but this may not be enough to offset the economic damage caused by tariffs. Buck, who helped pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, notes that while extending the tax law is necessary, it may not resonate with voters and that Republicans should pressure Trump to back down on his trade policy. The piece highlights the risk Republicans face in the upcoming midterm elections if they cannot demonstrate a stable economic footing. Optimism score: 45</p>

          <p>A new study from UCSF indicates that psilocybin, found in 'magic mushrooms,' may improve mood, cognition, and motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients. The small study involved 12 participants with mild to moderate Parkinson's who experienced improvements in mood and motor function after receiving doses of psilocybin. While the study showed promising results, researchers emphasize that it was a small pilot without a control group and recommend caution, further research is underway to rigorously test psilocybin's effectiveness.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that German firms in China are experiencing a decline in economic outlook due to the US-China tariff war, with Washington’s tariffs on Chinese goods having the largest impact. However, their investment plans in China remain largely unaffected, as most of these firms have adopted an 'in China for China' strategy, serving Chinese consumers rather than international ones. This deep localization has insulated their operations from direct US exposure, allowing them to navigate the tariff war relatively unscathed. The article notes that since President Trump's return to the White House, tariffs have risen significantly on both sides. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering cutting Medicaid provider taxes to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts, a move that could significantly impact state Medicaid programs and rural hospitals. Provider taxes, used by nearly every state, help cover Medicaid costs and draw additional federal matching funds, but Republicans are portraying them as wasteful. Eliminating these taxes could save the federal government over $600 billion over a decade, but hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue that such cuts would harm states and reduce payments to providers.

          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India launched strikes against Pakistan, escalating the conflict between the nuclear powers, and two aircraft were reported to have crashed. India claimed its forces struck nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, while Pakistani military officials reported over 20 deaths and dozens injured after six places were hit. Residents on the Indian side of Kashmir reported at least 10 deaths from Pakistani shelling. India said its military actions were measured and designed to be non-escalatory, but Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. The change aims to attract school or college leavers to the profession, as a growing number of drivers are set to retire by 2029. Union Aslef supports the move, and the Rail Safety and Standards Board's research suggests 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers.
