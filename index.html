          <p>Ange Postecoglou has been dismissed as Tottenham manager just 16 days after securing a Europa League title with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United, marking the club's first major trophy in 17 years. This triumph occurred amidst a challenging Premier League season where Tottenham finished 17th, losing 22 of their 38 matches. Postecoglou had expressed optimism for the future, but his tenure ended abruptly, exactly two years after his appointment from Celtic on a four-year contract. Potential replacements being considered include Brentford boss Thomas Frank, Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, and former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino. The team will be looking to fill the management position soon. Optimism for the team's future remains uncertain.</p>

        </div>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reviews "Bad Shabbos," a farce that relies heavily on clichés from other comedies, such as "Meet the Parents" and "The Birdcage," ultimately failing to offer much originality or emotional depth. The film centers on a chaotic Shabbat dinner where a Jewish family's attempt to impress the parents of their son's Catholic fiancée goes awry after an accidental death. While the cast, including Kyra Sedgwick, does their best, the characters often come across as stereotypes, and the plot feels contrived. Despite winning an Audience Award at the Tribeca Festival, the review suggests the film may elicit more eye rolls than laughs.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece argues that the growing divide between Donald Trump and Elon Musk represents a fundamental ideological split between nationalism and globalism. The article asserts that while Musk has been admired by some on the right for his defiance of woke ideology, his priorities lie outside of American interests, focusing on technological advancement and space exploration. It posits that Trump remains focused on restoring America's sovereignty and prioritizing the American worker, contrasting this with Musk's vision of a borderless, technologically optimized future. The author urges the MAGA faithful to choose between Trump's terrestrial project and Musk's extraterrestrial ambitions.</p>

          <h2>Locking in Home Equity Loan Rates in June 2025: A Timely Decision?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 13:42:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News analyzes whether homeowners should lock in home equity loan rates in June 2025, citing three key reasons. Firstly, home equity loan rates are stagnating after a period of decline, indicating uncertainty among lenders. Secondly, rates may remain elevated for longer than initially anticipated due to the Federal Reserve's paused interest-rate cut campaign. Lastly, home equity loans are still cheaper than alternatives like personal loans and credit cards, especially considering the fixed-rate benefit in a potentially rising-rate environment. The article suggests that locking in a rate now could be a prudent move for homeowners seeking financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to implement a full percentage point interest rate cut, despite a strong jobs report. Trump has consistently pressured Powell to lower rates, and made this latest demand via a Truth Social post, advocating for "Rocket Fuel" for the economy. Market forecasts indicate a low probability of any rate cut, let alone a full point, at the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting. The last time the central bank made a single rate cut of a full percentage point was in March 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

This followed Musk's criticism of Trump's policies and unsubstantiated claims regarding Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a court order that reinstated U.S. Department of Education employees who were laid off as part of the administration's efforts to streamline the agency. Administration officials argue that a U.S. District Judge lacked the authority to mandate the rehiring of workers, with the staff reduction intended to eliminate discretionary functions better left to the states. The layoffs led to the closure of several civil rights enforcement offices and the elimination of the team overseeing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This action is part of a broader effort to dismantle the Education Department, which has faced existential threats in the past.</p>

          <p>The International Pride Orchestra performed at the Strathmore Music Center in Maryland as a rebuke to Donald Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center and subsequent snub of the LGBTQ+ ensemble. The event featured classical music, choral performances, and drag performances, celebrating WorldPride, which is taking place in Washington D.C. The orchestra had hoped to play at the Kennedy Center, but Trump's administration has issued executive orders limiting transgender rights and rescinding anti-discrimination policies for LGBTQ+ people. The event served as a reminder that people don't feel safe to live and love openly.</p>

          <h2>WorldPride in D.C. Sparks Mixed Emotions Amid Trump Administration Policies</h2>

          <p>WorldPride is taking place in Washington, D.C., this year, causing mixed emotions within the LGBTQ+ community due to the Trump administration's policies. While some express fear and concern about safety, others are determined to attend and take a stand. The Trump administration has rolled back several protections for LGBTQ+ people, leading to the cancellation or relocation of Pride events at the Kennedy Center. Despite these challenges, organizers have implemented safety protocols and are finding alternative paths for the celebration. Many are prioritizing their emotional and physical safety, while others are finding ways to show up for the community outside of D.C.</p>

          <p>ABC News reports that measles cases in the U.S. are nearing a 30-year high, with 1,168 confirmed cases across 33 states, quadrupling the number from the previous year.

Tragically, at least two school-aged children have died, both unvaccinated and without underlying conditions. Health officials are urging vaccination to combat the spread of the disease, which can lead to severe complications and death.
