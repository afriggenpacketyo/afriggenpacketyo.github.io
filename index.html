          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. Vice President JD Vance met in New Delhi, expressing satisfaction with the progress of trade talks between India and the United States during Vance's visit. Both leaders emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in addressing regional and global issues. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer highlighted the need for reciprocity in the trade relationship, while acknowledging India's constructive engagement. Modi and Trump previously aimed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, but there are still some tariffs to be worked out. Optimism is high for a mutually beneficial outcome.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, forcing them to consider whether to devalue their own currencies. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness and could invite retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. Emerging markets face additional risks, including high inflation and potential capital flight, making devaluation a dangerous option. Central banks are currently avoiding a currency war, as it would add instability to the global economy.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant slump following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who he called a "major loser." The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply as investors grappled with tariff uncertainty and awaited tech earnings reports. The dollar index weakened, and gold reached a record high, signaling investor concerns about the safety of U.S. assets. The pressure on Powell to lower interest rates adds to market volatility.</p>

          <p>A minke whale that died in Long Beach Harbor earlier this month succumbed to domoic acid poisoning caused by a toxic algal bloom. The neurotoxin, produced by harmful algal blooms, accumulates in fish and is then ingested by marine mammals. This marks the fourth consecutive year of domoic acid events, with this year's bloom starting earlier and being more severe. Hundreds of sea lions and dolphins have also been affected by the bloom, attributed to upwelling, climate change, and runoff from fires.</p>
