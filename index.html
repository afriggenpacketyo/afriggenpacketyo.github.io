          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal mortgage fraud charges in a Virginia courtroom, following an indictment secured by a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney. The allegations claim James falsely described a property as a second home to obtain a more favorable mortgage rate, while actually using it as an investment rental. James vehemently denies the charges, labeling them as baseless and politically motivated retribution for her past legal actions against former President Trump. Her defense team is actively challenging the prosecutor's appointment and alleging unauthorized leaks to the press, adding layers of political tension to the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Six men have been sentenced to jail for their roles in a Russian-ordered arson attack that targeted a London warehouse providing crucial aid to Ukraine. The March 2024 fire at industrial units in Leyton, East London, resulted in £1.3 million in damages and specifically impacted a facility used to send goods, including Starlink satellite terminals, to Ukraine. The investigation revealed that ringleader Dylan Earl was recruited by the Wagner Group, a UK-proscribed terrorist organization, and was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident. The presiding judge at the Old Bailey underscored that the defendants were explicitly paid to promote the interests of a foreign power.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, known as "Brother Wang," an alleged fentanyl kingpin, has been extradited from Cuba to the U.S., a transfer facilitated by Mexico. He is accused of international drug trafficking, extensive money laundering, and forming alliances with major cartels like Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation. Zhi allegedly laundered over $20 million through shell companies and facilitated fentanyl transfers from China to various continents. This significant extradition highlights the Trump administration's ongoing pressure on Mexico and China to combat the pervasive problem of drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>The average price of a new car has reached an unprecedented $50,080 in September, marking the first time it has topped $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. This surge was primarily driven by a rush to purchase electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expired, along with increased luxury sales and tariffs. When considering financing, insurance, and fuel, the total monthly cost for a new car owner can exceed $1,200. Consequently, consumers are increasingly exploring used vehicles and leasing options as more affordable alternatives to manage these rising ownership expenses.</p>

          <p>A viral chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" due to high reported rates is misleading, as confirmed by a DW fact check. The article explains that significant differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors across countries make direct comparisons problematic. For instance, the UK's consent-based laws and counting multiple offenses per incident can inflate its figures compared to nations with narrower definitions. Criminologists recommend victim surveys, rather than police report statistics, as a more accurate method for measuring the true prevalence of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has halted all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an Ontario province TV ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Trump claimed the ad, which was running in the U.S., fraudulently misrepresented Reagan's views on tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford defended the ad, tweeting a link to an unedited Reagan speech where he discussed the negative impacts of high tariffs. This marks the second time Trump has threatened to end trade talks with Canada, reflecting ongoing frustrations in bilateral negotiations.</p>

          <p>Starting in 2025, non-spouse beneficiaries of inherited IRAs, such as adult children, must begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) while depleting the account over 10 years. This change, outlined in 2024 IRS regulations, applies if the original IRA owner reached RMD age before death. Failure to take these RMDs could result in a 25% penalty, though it can be reduced or waived under certain conditions. Experts advise proactive tax planning, including considering earlier withdrawals during lower-earning years, to manage tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for federal agencies by the October 1 deadline, leading to a halt in non-essential functions. Essential employees, like air traffic controllers and military personnel, continue working without pay, while others are furloughed. The Antideficiency Act mandates these closures, with exceptions for protecting life and property. The article details how Social Security and Medicare continue, but customer service can be affected, and warns of potential mass layoffs in some programs.</p>

          <p>A prolonged U.S. government shutdown could significantly disrupt air travel, despite essential FAA and TSA employees being required to work without pay. Travel experts warn that if a shutdown extends beyond two weeks, personnel shortages due to sick calls or job searches could lead to longer security lines and flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association estimates a $1 billion weekly economic cost and highlights exacerbating existing air traffic controller shortages. While train travel is less likely to be immediately affected, the overall impact on the travel industry could be substantial.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer confidence decreased for the third consecutive month in October, reflecting dimming economic outlooks driven by a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation.

Inflation expectations also crept up, primarily among independents and Republicans, underscoring the ongoing strain of high prices.

The owners, who say the decor was chosen by a TV show makeover, insist they aim to acknowledge, not celebrate, Boston's gritty past.
