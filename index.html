          <p>Columbia University requested the New York City Police Department's assistance in clearing a pro-Palestinian demonstration that occupied Butler Library. University officials stated that two public safety officers were injured during clashes with demonstrators attempting to enter the building. Acting University President Claire Shipman said the decision to involve the NYPD was necessary to ensure the community's safety. New York City Mayor Eric Adams emphasized the city's support for peaceful protest but condemned lawlessness, and Governor Kathy Hochul affirmed the right to protest peacefully while denouncing violence and vandalism. The university indicated that protesters who violated rules would face disciplinary action, and a student present during the protest described the disturbance caused by the demonstrators, noting their banners and disruption of academic activities.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Columbia University's Butler Library, renaming it ‚Äúthe Basel Al-Araj Popular University‚Äù in an attempt to revive campus protests from the previous spring. The protesters, wearing masks and kaffiyehs, faced off with Columbia security, leading to an hours-long standoff and escalating tensions outside the library. University administrators called the New York City Police Department to campus for the first time since April 2024, citing safety concerns and injuries to public safety officers. The protest occurred amid ongoing pressure from the Trump administration regarding the university's handling of antisemitism complaints and the potential loss of federal funding.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has expressed skepticism regarding the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to avoid seeking the return of Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador, where they are being held in a terrorism prison. Judge James E. Boasberg questioned the Justice Department lawyer about President Trump‚Äôs statement regarding Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongfully expelled to El Salvador, and the administration's role in the detention of the Venezuelan men. The ACLU has argued that the men were sent to the Salvadoran prison without due process and that the use of the Alien Enemies Act was unlawful. Judge Boasberg has deferred ruling but intends to order the government to disclose more information about its arrangements with El Salvador.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led bans on flying pride flags on government property in Utah and Idaho, Salt Lake City and Boise have creatively circumvented these restrictions by adopting official pride flags. Salt Lake City's mayor, Erin Mendenhall, introduced three new city flags featuring the city's sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag, which were unanimously approved by the city council. Similarly, Boise's mayor, Lauren McLean, issued a proclamation retroactively designating the pride flag as an official city flag. These measures are a direct response to state legislation limiting the types of flags that can be flown on government property, reflecting a broader trend of conservative legislatures targeting LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a short span, a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea. In this recent incident, the Super Hornet crashed during an attempted landing on the Truman's flight deck due to an arrestment failure; both pilots safely ejected and sustained minor injuries. This follows an earlier incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard while being towed in the hangar bay, with initial reports suggesting evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants as a possible cause, though this was later denied. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced multiple incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including an accidental shooting down of a plane and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a boost following the Trump administration's plan to revoke the "AI diffusion rule," which would have restricted the export of advanced AI chips. A Department of Commerce spokesperson confirmed the decision, stating that the rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the administration's new direction, asserting that it would provide America with an opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the importance of balancing national security with access to chips to bolster the American chip industry.

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are losing access to free black lung screenings due to budget cuts mandated by President Trump at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The cuts have led to job losses and concerns about the health and safety of miners, particularly younger workers. Catherine Blackwood, a former scientist at NIOSH, expressed anger and worry about the impacts of these cuts, emphasizing the unique and essential research conducted at the facility. Despite West Virginia's strong support for Trump, retired miner Marion Tennant criticized the cuts, stating that they undermine the safety of coal miners.</p>

          <p>New York State health authorities reported that 25 children died from influenza during the 2024-25 flu season, the highest number in recent years, amid declining vaccination rates. The CDC estimates that over 47 million people nationwide caught the flu, leading to over 600,000 hospitalizations, with hospitalization rates being the highest in 15 years. The decline in flu vaccinations reflects a growing distrust of the scientific establishment, leading to vaccine hesitancy. Only one of the 25 children who died from the flu in New York State was vaccinated.</p>

          <p>Following a dog attack in New York City where a Chihuahua named Penny was mauled by two pit bulls, state lawmakers are proposing "Penny's Law." The proposed legislation aims to criminalize negligent dog handling and penalize owners who flee the scene of an attack. Currently, under New York law, dogs are considered property, which limits legal recourse in such incidents to civil matters. The attack on Penny sparked national outrage, highlighting the need for stronger accountability for dog owners.</p>

          <p>Mainstream economic data has been slow to reflect the impact of tariffs and uncertainty, prompting economists to examine alternative sources such as earnings calls and private-sector data. Evidence of the trade wars' effects includes decreased spending at McDonald's, fewer container ships at the Port of Los Angeles, and companies shifting production out of China. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these indicators as it sets monetary policy amid shifting tariff policies. Economists are seeking early indications of whether tariffs will lead to higher prices, reduced consumer spending, or layoffs.</p>
