          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly reduced the number of people listed as missing following deadly flash floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. The disaster, which occurred over the July 4th weekend, claimed at least 135 lives statewide, with most fatalities happening along the Guadalupe River. The floods, caused by fast-moving waters that rose 26 feet, devastated the popular tourist region, highlighting its vulnerability to extreme weather. The response by local authorities has come under scrutiny, with questions raised about the adequacy of warnings provided to residents.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offensive struggles continued as they lost 8-7 to the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their ninth defeat in eleven games. Despite scoring seven runs and hitting back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, the team failed to overcome an early deficit and costly pitching. Key moments of the game highlighted the Dodgers' inability to capitalize on opportunities, such as leaving a go-ahead run at third base with no outs. The loss underscores a frustrating period for the high-priced roster, which continues to search for consistent performance.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are disproportionately impacting small, rural radio stations that serve as vital sources of local news and information. Stations like Allegheny Mountain Radio in Appalachia, which relies on federal funds for up to 65% of its budget, now face an existential threat. These stations provide essential community services, from emergency announcements to local obituaries, in areas with limited internet and cell service. The funding cuts, driven by political motivations targeting larger networks like NPR, are seen by local operators as harming the very communities they aim to serve.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that the persistent failure to achieve peace in major global conflicts stems from a profound crisis of the moral order, not just political deadlock. The author argues that a rise in moral relativism has eroded universally accepted standards, making it difficult to condemn atrocities and mediate disputes effectively. This moral fracturing is seen in conflicts from Gaza to Ukraine, where actions are justified differently by opposing sides, hindering any path to resolution. The article calls for a return to shared ethical principles, defined by international law and social contracts, as a necessary foundation for lasting peace.</p>

The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and is being treated for his injuries.

Her defense bizarrely involved a story about her and her husband reenacting a Bugs Bunny cartoon, with her husband saying "No more buwwets" in an Elmer Fudd voice, leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. Investigators were initially divided, but evidence, including two gunshot wounds and forensic analysis showing her story was improbable, led to her prosecution. After a first trial ended in a hung jury, she was convicted of second-degree murder in a second trial.</p>

Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Burch.

However, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office anticipates few will seek reimbursement, and the process for collection and refunding remains unclear.

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, visited the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn an arson attack on the ancient Church of Saint George. Residents have blamed extremist Israeli settlers for the fire, which occurred amid a surge in settler violence since the start of the Gaza war. Huckabee, typically a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and demanded that the perpetrators be prosecuted. The visit highlights growing international concern over violence and accountability in the West Bank.</p>
