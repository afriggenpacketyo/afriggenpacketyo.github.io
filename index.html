        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has revealed that the power outage and subsequent fire that shut down Heathrow Airport were caused by a moisture issue first identified seven years prior. The problem at the North Hyde substation, which supplies power to the airport, was recorded in July 2018 but went unfixed, with basic maintenance even being deferred. The failure impacted over 66,000 customers and disrupted around 270,000 journeys, prompting an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem into National Grid's maintenance practices and raising concerns about the resilience of the UK's critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their 28-year-old forward, Luis Diaz. The Premier League club has made it clear to Bayern's director of sport that Diaz is not for sale and they will not engage in any discussions regarding a potential transfer. This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers the Colombia international, who scored 22 goals last season, an integral part of their squad and is adamant about keeping him at the club.</p>

After two days, the jurors informed the judge they had reached verdicts on four other counts, including sex trafficking and prostitution charges, but were "unpersuadable" on the racketeering count. The judge has urged them to continue their efforts to avoid a hung jury on this complex charge, which carries a potential life sentence.

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada has faced criticism from Indian fashion critics and officials for showcasing sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week that closely resemble traditional Kolhapuri chappals. These handcrafted leather sandals, which date back to the 12th century in India, sell locally for a fraction of the price luxury brands would charge. In response to the outcry, a Prada executive acknowledged the design's inspiration from Indian footwear and stated the company is committed to a dialogue with local artisan communities. The incident has prompted calls in India to patent the traditional design internationally to prevent future copyright infringement.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the last. In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he affirmed that his successor should be found and recognized according to traditional Buddhist practices. He explicitly stated that the process should be managed by his Gaden Phodrang Trust, signaling that China, which claims authority to approve the next leader, should not interfere. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and view the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader.</p>

          <p>A powerful storm has battered Australia's southeast coast, leaving over 35,000 properties in New South Wales without electricity and causing significant travel disruptions. The severe weather, which brought intense rainfall of up to 150 millimeters in some areas, prompted emergency warnings and impacted hundreds of properties. Sydney's airport experienced major disruptions, with dozens of domestic flights cancelled and international flights delayed. Authorities have credited community adherence to warnings for preventing more severe damage and loss of life as the storm system is expected to continue before moving toward New Zealand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a deal to acquire TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, for £2.65 billion, a move that would create the UK's third-largest bank. Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which likely means the TSB brand will disappear from the High Street, following the pattern of past acquisitions like Abbey and Alliance & Leicester. While the deal awaits shareholder and regulatory approval, Santander has indicated that the merger will lead to efficiency savings, likely resulting in job cuts and branch closures, particularly where there is overlap. The deal is expected to close in early 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark inquiry in Australia, the Yoorrook Justice Commission, has found that the actions of British colonists against the Indigenous population in the state of Victoria amounted to genocide. The report details how mass killings, disease, and cultural destruction caused the local Indigenous population to decline by 75% in the two decades after colonization began in the 1830s. The commission, Australia's first formal truth-telling inquiry, issued 100 recommendations for redress, including reparations and overhauls of the education and health systems. The finding is a significant moment in the national dialogue on historical injustices against Indigenous Australians.</p>

Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, arguing Saenz's crimes were "senseless" and "sadistic." His defense is requesting a 45-year term, citing his remorse and a difficult upbringing, though prosecutors contend he remains an active gang member in prison.</p>

Separately, a coalition of twenty states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the illegal mass transfer of personal health data to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement purposes.

          <p>The recent ceasefire proposal, announced by President Trump, represents a significant moment but is fraught with unanswered questions and political challenges, according to this analysis. The key obstacle is whether Hamas will accept a 60-day truce when it has consistently demanded a permanent end to the war. For Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a 60-day pause may be a politically calculated move to appease far-right coalition partners who oppose a permanent ceasefire and would likely collapse his government. The proposal's success may hinge on details not yet made public, such as the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal and the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released.</p>

The company's stock has surged over 1,300% since its debut in June 2024, driven by strong same-store sales growth and a powerful online presence.

          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has signaled a move to crack down on the intense price wars affecting many of the country's industries. At a high-level economic meeting, Xi used the specific phrase "disorderly low-price competition" to describe the issue, indicating a more targeted approach than the previously used term "involutionary competition." The government aims to regulate this behavior to protect innovation, improve product quality, and encourage the phasing out of outdated production capacity. The move is seen as crucial for the long-term health of the Chinese economy, which has been hampered by companies aggressively cutting prices to gain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, which legal experts considered weak, alleged election interference based on routine editorial decisions made by CBS News. The settlement, which does not include an apology, has been viewed as a blow to journalistic independence, struck by corporate executives over the objections of news division leaders. Critics suggest the payment is "protection money," intended to smooth the regulatory approval of Paramount's pending sale to Skydance Media by the Trump-led FCC.</p>

The EU remains concerned about China's economic practices and its continued support for Russia, issues on which Beijing has shown little willingness to change. As discussions continue, Brussels is focused on trying to achieve a more balanced relationship rather than accepting a "reset" on China's terms, while also facing pressure to resolve trade disputes with the United States.</p>

          <h2>Xpeng Maintains Sales Momentum Amid Fierce Chinese EV Price War</h2>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng reported strong sales for June, marking its eighth consecutive month of delivering over 30,000 cars, defying an intense industry-wide price war. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, Xpeng's steady performance contrasts with mixed results from rivals like Nio and Li Auto, who saw more modest or declining monthly sales. The fierce competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, continues to pressure automakers, including Tesla, which has seen its market share in China face challenges from new, aggressively priced models from local competitors like Xiaomi.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 35% on Japanese imports if a trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This would be a significant increase from the current 10% levy that was temporarily put in place to allow for negotiations. Trump expressed doubt that a deal could be reached with Tokyo, continuing his administration's aggressive trade posture. Japan has stated it will not make concessions that harm its agricultural sector, a point of contention after Trump criticized the country's restrictions on U.S. rice imports.</p>

          <h2>US Halts Some Missile Shipments to Ukraine Citing Low National Stockpiles</h2>

          <p>The Pentagon has paused certain weapons deliveries to Ukraine, including critical air defense interceptors, due to concerns that U.S. military stockpiles have become too low. A White House spokesperson stated the decision was made to prioritize America's own military readiness after a review of its global security assistance commitments. The move is a significant blow to Ukraine, which relies heavily on U.S. munitions to defend against relentless Russian missile and drone attacks. The halt in shipments comes as Russian forces continue to make gradual advances in the southeastern regions of Ukraine.</p>
