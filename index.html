          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests based on factors like race or location. The order, which applies to several counties, follows a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling. In response, the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, while President Trump authorized law enforcement to arrest protesters who assault them, referencing recent clashes during raids.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist from the Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute warns that extreme summer heat significantly strains the cardiovascular system, forcing the heart to work harder to cool the body. This increased workload can elevate heart rate and oxygen demand, raising the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, and arrhythmias, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. The article advises staying hydrated, avoiding midday exertion, and recognizing warning signs like chest tightness, shortness of breath, and dizziness to prevent serious cardiac events.</p>

          <p>Among the victims of the devastating flash floods in Kerrville, Texas, was Jane Ragsdale, the beloved owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls. Ragsdale, who was in her late 60s, was a central figure in the community, known for her generosity, leadership, and lifelong dedication to the camp her family had run for decades. Friends and community members remember her as a warm, intelligent, and capable person who embodied the spirit of the region and will be deeply missed.</p>

          <p>Chinese academic analysis suggests the growing alliance between some US tech titans and the "Make America Great Again" movement may be unstable and could ultimately backfire. The article notes that while many of Trump's tech backers advocate for containing China's technological rise, underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA camp could undermine these efforts. The analysis also highlights a trend of deepening cooperation between the tech and defense industries, raising concerns about the emergence of aggressive "tech hawks."</p>

          <p>Wildfires sparked by lightning have forced evacuations from the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The Dragon Bravo Fire has prompted all residents in the area to leave immediately, following the evacuation of about 500 visitors the previous night. A larger blaze, the White Sage Fire, is burning north of the park, also causing evacuations and road closures. In neighboring Colorado, similar lightning-sparked fires have led to the complete evacuation of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park.</p>
