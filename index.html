          <p>North Korea has denounced the U.S. Department of Justice as running an "absurd smear campaign" after the DOJ exposed a massive scheme where North Korean IT workers infiltrated over 100 U.S. companies. The operation, which generated millions for the regime, involved using false identities and remote access to company computers. The DOJ has unsealed indictments against several individuals from the U.S., China, and Taiwan for facilitating the scheme. Pyongyang claims the U.S. is the true source of "international cyberspace instability" and threatens countermeasures.</p>

          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market and ordered the seizure of over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The regulator accused the firm of using manipulative trading strategies to artificially influence the Nifty 50 index for profit, even after receiving an explicit warning. This action comes amid broader concerns from SEBI about the impact of algorithmic and proprietary trading on retail investors. The firm's bank accounts in India have been effectively frozen pending further notice.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has achieved a significant scientific milestone by cultivating a human heart structure within a pig embryo, which reportedly continued to beat for 21 days. Led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, the scientists reprogrammed human stem cells to enhance their survival in the pig host. The modified cells were then implanted into pig embryos at the blastocyst stage, marking a notable advancement in the field of chimera research and organ generation. This follows a previous success where the team grew human kidneys in pigs for 28 days.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi is warning that the Iranian government is exploiting its recent conflict with Israel to intensify repression against its own citizens. In a message from Tehran, she stated that the regime is escalating executions and arrests to spread fear and deflect from internal policy failures. Mohammadi condemned Israel's strike on Evin Prison but asserted that the subsequent crackdown, including harsh conditions for transferred prisoners, poses an even greater threat to human rights. She is calling for renewed international attention on the deteriorating situation for activists in Iran.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and other ranking Democrats, the brief argues the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish the agency. The move follows the administration's workforce reductions that cut nearly half the department's staff and a recent decision to pause over $6 billion in congressionally approved education funding. Lawmakers contend that only Congress can create or abolish federal agencies through legislation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices unchanged for U.S. residents. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the surcharge, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually for park improvements. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents "preferential treatment" in park access systems, such as lotteries or permits.

This surge aligns with the administration's mass deportation campaign and a recent goal of 3,000 ICE arrests per day.

          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has found that the Home Office does not know whether foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee criticized the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. The report highlights that the Home Office has shown "little curiosity" about the system's operation and has been "slow and ineffective" in tackling the exploitation of workers who have entered through the program.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to miss approximately six weeks after being placed on the injured list with a bone bruise in his left knee. The injury occurred during a game when an opposing player's helmet hit his knee during a slide into third base. While the initial collision looked severe, an MRI revealed no structural damage, which Muncy described as the "best-case scenario." His absence creates a significant gap in the Dodgers' lineup, as he was a leading offensive contributor for the team in recent months.</p>

          <p>The major tax and spending bill passed by Republicans is set to fundamentally reshape the U.S. social safety net, achieving long-standing conservative objectives. The legislation extends tax cuts while imposing stricter work requirements and funding cuts for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Nonpartisan analysis predicts these changes could cause millions to lose health and food benefits. While Republicans argue the reforms will reduce fraud and boost the economy, critics warn of widespread negative effects on low-income families and a significant increase in the national deficit.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Los Angeles have charged seven individuals in connection with a sophisticated jewelry heist that netted over $1 million in goods from a Glendale store. The group, described as a "South American crime ring," allegedly broke into the store by cutting a hole in the roof. They were later arrested while attempting a similar burglary at another jewelry store, where they reportedly used signal jammers and cut utility lines. The defendants face multiple charges, including grand theft and commercial burglary, to which they have all pleaded not guilty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy reveals a mixed but concerning impact on the U.S. economy. After an initial market downturn when broad tariffs were announced, stocks rebounded when the administration paused the most severe plans, but vulnerable sectors like retail and auto remain weak. While overall consumer price inflation has not yet spiked, economists expect increases as higher duties on goods are passed on to customers. Early signs of a consumer pullback are emerging, with retail sales declining and spending growth slowing, creating uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after winning a large majority, Keir Starmer's Labour government is facing scrutiny over its progress on key pledges. BBC correspondents assessed six policy areas, noting a mixed record. While net migration has fallen, this is largely due to previous policies, and small boat crossings have increased. On the economy, growth has been minimal, and foreign policy has been marked by caution. In education and health, the government has made some structural changes and modest progress on waiting lists but faces ongoing challenges with recruitment and social care.</p>

According to U.S. Northern Command, the Marines will perform non-law enforcement duties within ICE facilities and are prohibited from direct contact with detainees. This follows a similar deployment to Los Angeles and is part of a "whole-of-government" approach to increase immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can remove eight noncitizens who have been held at a military facility in Djibouti. The ruling clears the way for their deportation to South Sudan, a country with which they have no known ties. The decision overturns a lower court's order that had blocked the removal, with the majority opinion stating that the administration cannot be held to due process requirements that the high court had previously stayed.

Supporters argue the laws are necessary to ensure fair competition, while opponents contend they are discriminatory and violate the Constitution and Title IX. The case places the court at the center of a major cultural and political flashpoint, with a decision expected to have nationwide implications.</p>
