Zelenskyy emphasized the need for strengthened air defense and urged the United States to respond to Ukraine's request for air defense systems.

          <p>Confusion over budget airline baggage rules has led to a legal row in the EU, with passengers often caught out by inconsistent or unclear regulations. Different airlines have varying rules on the acceptable size and weight of hand luggage, with some charging extra for overhead cabin bags. This has prompted the EU's largest consumer group to push for fairer and more consistent hand luggage rules. EU transport ministers have proposed standardised sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, but the European Consumer Organisation believes the proposals do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can flush out superbugs from the bowel. Early data suggests this new approach can replace antibiotic-resistant bacteria with a mix of healthy gut bacteria. The trial, involving 41 patients, showed that patients were willing to take the pills and that the donor bacteria were detected in the bowels a month later. This research signifies a shift in understanding the importance of bacteria for overall health.</p>
