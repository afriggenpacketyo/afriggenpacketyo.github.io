          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who alleged sexual abuse and trafficking, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Her family stated she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and the toll became unbearable. Giuffre accused Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of grooming and sexually abusing her from her teens and filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, alleging sexual assault when she was 17, which was later settled out of court. She is survived by her three children and remembered as a fierce warrior against sexual abuse and sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>World leaders are gathering for Pope Francis' funeral, presenting an opportunity for informal diplomatic conversations. While formal meetings are unlikely out of respect for the solemn occasion, leaders may engage in brief discussions on the sidelines. Attention is focused on whether Presidents Trump and Zelensky will use this chance to discuss potential ceasefires in Ukraine, though tensions between them could complicate matters. The funeral mass itself may also lead to unexpected interactions, such as leaders shaking hands with adversaries during the sign of peace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's attacks on the press, including barring reporters and defunding media outlets, have sparked legal battles testing the First Amendment. Courts have ruled against the White House in some cases, such as restoring funding to Voice of America and reinstating the Associated Press' access. Experts warn that these freedoms require active defense, as the administration targets law firms and signals further moves against publicly funded broadcasters. These actions create confusion and room for mis- and disinformation, threatening democratic stability.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, as supporters rallied outside the New York City courthouse. Supporters view Mangione as a political prisoner, criticizing Thompson's and UnitedHealthcare's actions as "legal murder." The arraignment included discussions on Bondi's public commentary and concerns about finding an impartial jury. The trial date is set for 2026, with the question of which trial (state or federal) will proceed first unresolved.</p>

          <p>A Kyiv resident recounts a night of intense shelling following the end of a Russian "Easter ceasefire," hiding in a bathroom as bombs fell. The author criticizes Donald Trump's proposals for a peace agreement, viewing them as humiliating for Ukraine and tacitly consenting to Putin's continued aggression. The author questions why Ukraine is repeatedly left to face Russia alone, despite international agreements guaranteeing its sovereignty. The essay ends with a soldier playing the piano at the Kyiv railway station and a sculpture symbolizing freedom and will.</p>
