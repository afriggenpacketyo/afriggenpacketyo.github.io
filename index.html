          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:30:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified additional documents regarding the 2016 Russia investigation, claiming they show Obama administration officials fabricated intelligence to undermine Donald Trump. Democrats and former intelligence officials dispute this, expressing grave concerns that the release irresponsibly exposes sensitive sources and methods used for gathering intelligence on Russia. The move has intensified political divisions, with Gabbard asserting it prevents the politicization of intelligence, while critics accuse the administration of creating a distraction and endangering national security. The documents focus on a 2017 House Intelligence Committee report and do not fundamentally alter previous assessments of Russian interference.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for American Eagle Outfitters soared by 12% in a rally attributed to individual retail investors, marking it as the latest meme stock. The surge is linked to discussions on the Wall Street Bets Reddit forum, fueled by the stock's high short interest of over 13%, which can lead to a short squeeze. The company also announced a new marketing campaign for its denim line featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, aiming to capitalize on the popularity of Western styles. This trading activity provides a temporary reprieve for the stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed a major free trade agreement, aiming to boost the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually. The deal, which took three years to negotiate, will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles and jewelry to the UK. It is hailed as the most significant trade deal for Britain since Brexit and is expected to create over 2,200 jobs. The agreement also includes a new plan to address illegal migration and enhance collaboration on defense, technology, and climate issues.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a 64-year-old man in Arizona for the 1984 murder and sexual assault of two teenagers in Northern California. The cold case involved Terrance Arndt, who was fatally shot, and an 18-year-old female survivor who was assaulted. After decades with no leads, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office used forensic genetic genealogy in 2024 to identify Roger Neil Schmidt Sr. as a suspect. A DNA sample from Schmidt confirmed a match to evidence from the crime scene, leading to his arrest on charges of murder and sexual assault, bringing a long-awaited resolution to the community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at preventing the use of so-called "woke AI" by the federal government and positioning the U.S. as a leader in artificial intelligence. One order explicitly targets AI models influenced by ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), mandating that government-procured AI must be neutral and prioritize accuracy over political agendas. The administration's "American AI Action Plan" also seeks to remove regulatory hurdles for AI development and establish a program to promote U.S. AI technology exports. Critics note the language aligns with that of Elon Musk's xAI, which has faced its own controversies regarding AI bias.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission is conducting a massive revision of electoral rolls in the state of Bihar, requiring the re-verification of nearly 80 million voters ahead of state polls. The stated goal is to remove deceased individuals, duplicates, and alleged illegal immigrants from the lists. However, the move has triggered fears of disenfranchisement, particularly among poor and marginalized communities who may lack the required documentation to prove their citizenship and eligibility.

          <p>Extensive research on four-day workweek trials reveals significant benefits beyond improved work-life balance, according to Boston College professor Juliet Schor. Studies involving hundreds of companies show that employees report feeling more productive, less stressed, and more recovered, leading to enhanced overall well-being. Contrary to expectations, the pace of work did not intensify, and employees did not use the extra day off to take on second jobs. Schor suggests that despite these positive outcomes, which include increased business profits and near-zero employee turnover, widespread adoption is slow due to managerial resistance to ceding control and the perceived risk of such a radical change.</p>

The vote reflects deep political divisions on the self-ruling island as it faces increasing military pressure from China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.

This aims to address a financing gap for lower- and middle-income households and help increase housing supply amid a national shortage.

While China has demonstrated it can crack down on the trade when incentivized, such as in 2019 under tariff pressure, its cooperation has been inconsistent and tied to the broader state of U.S.-China relations. The analysis suggests Beijing views the opioid crisis as an American problem and withholds full enforcement to extract concessions from Washington. Despite recent restrictions on some chemicals, China has not implemented stricter verification or prosecution measures that could significantly curb the trade.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's life sentence, police released documents revealing unusual incidents at the victims' home before the November 2022 killings. One victim, Kaylee Goncalves, reported seeing an unknown man staring at her and had mentioned having a stalker to a friend. On another occasion, the roommates found their front door open and armed themselves with golf clubs. The documents detail the extensive investigation, including numerous tips and the use of DNA from a knife sheath to identify Kohberger. They also describe Kohberger's brief interview with police after his arrest, where he requested a lawyer before any substantive questioning about the murders occurred.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, is expected to meet with the Department of Justice. The meeting follows a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche expressing his intent to ask Maxwell what she knows about others who may have been involved in Epstein's crimes. This development occurs amid sustained pressure on the Trump administration to release evidence from the Epstein files. The House Oversight Committee has indicated it will issue a subpoena for the documents after the DOJ decided to withhold them from public view.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has finalized a deal with the Trump administration to restore $400 million in federal funding, which was cut over accusations of on-campus antisemitism. The agreement, which will cost the university $220 million in settlements, includes new measures that critics warn will restrict academic freedom and pro-Palestinian speech. The deal has been met with both praise from groups who sought reforms and condemnation from faculty who call it "extortion." This agreement is the first of its kind and is seen as a significant moment in the relationship between higher education and a government that has been openly critical of universities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a return to monetary easing, Turkey's central bank has cut its key interest rate by three percentage points, bringing it down to 43%. This is the first rate reduction since an emergency hike in April and suggests growing confidence in the country's efforts to control inflation, which has been steadily decreasing. The move was a larger cut than many market analysts had anticipated, drawing mixed reactions. While some see it as a positive step supported by easing inflation, others view it as an overly dovish move that could undermine the central bank's credibility and independence.

          <p>This article provides an overview of average mortgage interest rates as of late July 2025, a crucial factor for homebuyers and those considering refinancing in a challenging market. National averages for a 30-year fixed mortgage are around 6.79%, while a 15-year loan averages 6.01%. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, as top rates are typically reserved for borrowers with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. Additionally, shopping around and comparing offers from various lenders, including those beyond a borrower's current institution, is recommended to find the most favorable terms and lowest lifetime loan costs.

          <p>The European Union and China have agreed to a new "export supply mechanism" to address European concerns over Beijing's recent export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the agreement after a summit, stating the upgraded mechanism will allow for quick resolution of supply chain bottlenecks. The issue arose after China imposed licensing requirements on the critical materials in response to U.S. tariffs, which disrupted some European production lines. The deal is seen as a practical solution to ensure a more reliable supply of these vital resources for European industries.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual move, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, escalating his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential visit to the central bank in nearly two decades and is seen as a significant challenge to the Fed's traditional independence from political influence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even floated the idea of firing him. The visit brings the president's criticism directly to the chairman's doorstep, intensifying the conflict over monetary policy and the autonomy of the nation's central bank.</p>

The initial ground collapse occurred near their work area, and a subsequent collapse blocked their exit route. The miners, two from British Columbia and one from Ontario, have had restricted communication since the second collapse, and operations at the mine have been suspended.</p>
