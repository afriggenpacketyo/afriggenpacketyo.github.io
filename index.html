          <p>The article details a successful week for Donald Trump, highlighting what his administration frames as major wins. These include a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following a US strike, increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies, and a significant Supreme Court ruling that limits judicial power to block his executive orders.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy analysts are forecasting that Americans could see the lowest summer gas prices since 2021, with the national average potentially dropping below $3 per gallon by September. This expected decrease is attributed to the de-escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, which had previously caused a spike in oil prices, as well as typical summer factors like increased refinery production. The article suggests that despite temporary shocks, the overall trend is a slow decline in fuel costs, with some experts noting that Americans are spending a smaller percentage of their income on energy compared to the past.

          <p>Despite claiming a military victory over Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces significant political challenges at home, including low public trust. Polling data indicates that a majority of Israelis want an end to the war in Gaza in exchange for hostages and nearly half believe he is prolonging the conflict for personal political gain. The article explores the complexities of his leadership, noting his ongoing corruption trial and the international criticism over the war in Gaza. This analysis suggests that calling for early elections would be a major risk for Netanyahu, as his popularity has not significantly bounced from the recent conflict.</p>

The event has drawn international attention, with EU officials expected to participate in solidarity.

          <p>A series of decisive military actions by Israel against Iran and its proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, has significantly altered the power dynamics in the Middle East. The article provides a broad analysis of how these conflicts have reasserted Israel's military dominance in the region, decimating what was known as Iran's "axis of resistance." However, it also highlights that these military successes have not resolved underlying political issues, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and have tarnished Israel's international reputation due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The piece concludes that while Israel's military power may now be supreme, long-term stability remains uncertain.</p>

The extreme heat, driven by hot air from North Africa, is considered unusual for June and has already contributed to wildfires near Athens.

          <p>Following the primary victory of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, Republican leaders are framing his win as evidence of the Democratic Party's radicalism. At events like the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit, figures like RNC Chair Michael Whatley and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin have depicted Mamdani's progressive platform as the new face of the Democratic Party. The article notes that while some moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from Mamdani, others have defended him against what they call Islamophobic attacks from certain Republican members of Congress.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Colorado funeral home has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for a scheme involving the improper storage of nearly 190 bodies and providing fake ashes to grieving families. Jon Hallford pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud for misusing nearly $900,000 in COVID-19 relief funds on luxury items, in addition to state charges of corpse abuse. The court heard harrowing testimony from victims' families, who described the profound emotional trauma of discovering their loved ones were not cremated but left to decay in a squalid building.</p>

          <p>As a record heatwave hits the US, child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the danger of children dying from heatstroke in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died after being left in cars, with an average of 38 such deaths occurring annually. Experts emphasize that a vehicle's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature rises three to five times faster than an adult's. To prevent these tragedies, advocates recommend creating routines and reminders, such as leaving a personal item in the backseat.</p>

          <p>The New York Islanders chose defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL draft during an emotional ceremony. Schaefer, a 17-year-old from the Erie Otters, became emotional on stage, honoring his mother who passed away from cancer 16 months ago. The Islanders added a pink ribbon patch to his jersey in her memory. Schaefer is a highly-touted, puck-moving defenseman who is just the fifth defenseman to be selected first overall since 2000. The draft also saw high-scoring forward Michael Misa go second to the San Jose Sharks.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a decisive 54-7 victory against the Western Force in Perth, scoring eight tries in front of a record rugby crowd. Despite a competitive first half where the Force had significant possession, the Lions' clinical finishing gave them a 21-7 lead at the break. The tourists dominated the second half, though the win was marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries.

          <p>In a landmark 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against the use of nationwide injunctions by lower federal courts. The case, which stemmed from challenges to an executive order on birthright citizenship, focused solely on the scope of judicial remedies. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that the historical basis of judicial power does not support one judge halting a government policy for the entire country. The article analyzes the significant implications of this ruling but notes that other legal avenues, like class-action lawsuits and associational standing, may still allow for broad relief.</p>

The author contends that Mamdani's unwavering support for Palestine, long considered a political liability, became an asset thanks to years of activism that shifted public opinion. The campaign's ground game was fueled by organized groups and student activists already engaged in progressive politics, including pro-Palestinian advocacy. The article concludes that this win demonstrates how Palestine has become a central issue in domestic US politics, capable of mobilizing a powerful voting bloc.</p>

They warn that Beijing could replicate these high-stakes tactics against the island, leveraging its extensive intelligence network, which is believed to have already penetrated Taiwan's political and defense systems. Experts suggest Taiwan is particularly vulnerable due to its proximity to mainland China and the deep social and cultural ties that can make it easier for Chinese operatives to infiltrate and recruit assets.

Rare earths are essential for components in both gas and electric vehicles, from catalytic converters to motors and batteries. While China controls about 70% of the mining, its near-total monopoly on processing gives it powerful leverage that could be used to shut down auto factories worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece traces previous economic reboots, from the post-war New Deal consensus to the rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s.

          <p>A county in China's southwestern Guizhou province is on high alert for more flooding after record-breaking downpours earlier in the week killed at least six people. Authorities in Rongjiang county ordered new evacuations on Saturday as forecasts predicted another deluge. Earlier, "exceptionally large floods" had swept through the area, inundating low-lying regions, damaging infrastructure, and cutting off transportation and communication links. The water level at one hydrological station had surged more than five meters above its flood control limit, submerging the county's largest shopping center.</p>
