          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, was arrested for allegedly driving his car in the wrong direction on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture. The man collided with two vehicles and is accused of failing to report the accident. The incident led to a pile-up involving four vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to four women. The man reportedly continued driving the wrong way for about 10 kilometers after the initial collision and police suspect he may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has disrupted Democrats' efforts to address missteps during his presidency and the 2024 election. While many express sympathy, some question the timing of the announcement, suspecting it's a deflection from growing criticism. Former Representative Dean Phillips suggested the diagnosis was timed to counter the negative narrative surrounding Biden's age and performance. Despite the outpouring of support, the revelation has reignited discussions about Biden's health and its impact on his legacy, with some questioning when he first learned about his condition.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, faces charges of assaulting federal agents after a confrontation at an immigration detention center in New Jersey. Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges, while simultaneously dismissing a trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, whose arrest instigated the clash. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents escalated the situation. The congresswoman maintains she was fulfilling her oversight responsibilities, while critics argue the prosecution is an attempt to stifle opposition to immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A Delaware animal shelter is struggling to care for thousands of chicks that were abandoned in a USPS truck for three days, resulting in the death of thousands more. The United States Postal Service is investigating the incident, while the hatchery that raised the chicks cannot take them back due to biosecurity concerns. The First State Animal Center and SPCA is now offering the birds for adoption, but is facing financial strain as it provides 24/7 care for the surviving chicks, turkeys, geese, and quail.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, the new president of the Kennedy Center, appointed by President Trump, has alleged that the center's deferred maintenance and deficit are "criminal" and will be referred to federal prosecutors. Grenell claims that officials found $26 million in "phantom revenue" in the center's budgets. Kennedy Center officials attributed the deficit to a review by the new chief financial officer. The center also announced its next season would feature some nonunion casts, a break from the past.</p>

The NTSB is asking the public for video footage of the collision and a preliminary report is expected in 30 days.</p>
