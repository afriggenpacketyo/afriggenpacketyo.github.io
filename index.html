            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 04:51:10 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>DHL Express has temporarily suspended deliveries to US consumers for shipments valued over $800 due to a significant increase in customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The company is working to scale up operations to manage the surge in formal customs clearances, but shipments over $800 may experience multi-day delays. The White House is also planning to close a loophole on May 2 that allows low-value packages from China and Hong Kong to enter the US without duties, impacting companies like Shein and Temu, who have warned of potential price increases. The Trump administration claims these measures are aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain. Optimism score is 70.</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman who killed 23 people at an El Paso Walmart in 2019, is expected to plead guilty to capital murder and receive a life sentence without parole. This plea deal avoids the death penalty on the state charge, as Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court for hate crime and weapons charges. Crusius confessed to targeting Mexicans in the shooting, motivated by racist beliefs expressed in an online manifesto. The plea deal aims to bring closure to the case for the victims' families, though some initially sought the death penalty. Optimism score is 40.</p>
