          <p>With the increasing frequency of rocket launches by companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, physicists are studying the impact of sonic booms on communities. Kent Gee at Brigham Young University is leading research into the unique three-part sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters, aiming to understand what noise levels are acceptable to the public. As SpaceX tests the larger and louder Starship rocket, there's a push to gather data to mitigate potential disruptions before they become widespread. The goal is not to halt launches, but to find ways to lessen the noise impact on surrounding areas, ensuring that space exploration can continue without negatively affecting communities.</p>

          <p>Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced the capture of Lenton Vanburen, the sixth inmate who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier in May. Vanburen, who was originally serving time for parole violation and weapons charges, was apprehended in Baton Rouge. Ten inmates escaped on May 16 after forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall, with surveillance video capturing their escape through a loading dock. The escape went unnoticed for several hours due to the absence of a deputy in the area, and at least nine people have been arrested in connection with the incident, including a maintenance worker accused of aiding the escape.</p>

          <p>Senators Ted Cruz and Ben Ray Lujan have introduced a bipartisan bill to streamline the presidential permitting process for international bridges and land ports of entry with Mexico and Canada.

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's largest creditor to Germany for the first time in 34 years, according to the Finance Ministry. While Japan's gross external assets rose to a record high of 533.05 trillion yen, it was surpassed by Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, and Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan increased its net external credit for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States, while the U.S. has a net external liability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union from June 1 to July 9, providing time for negotiations.

Trump had previously threatened the tariffs due to trade disputes with the EU, which caused market instability. Von der Leyen affirmed the importance of the EU-U.S. trade relationship and expressed readiness for swift talks, as both sides aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.</p>

The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. While the move aims to increase entry-level apprenticeships, critics argue that it will harm public services and limit professional opportunities for those without university degrees.

          <p>King Charles's visit to Canada is viewed as a subtle diplomatic move to underscore Canadian sovereignty amid tensions with the U.S. under President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to the King to open Parliament, a task usually delegated to the governor-general, is seen as a symbolic gesture. The King's speech is expected to emphasize Canada's distinct identity, with past actions by Trump, including suggestions of annexation, fueling concerns over Canadian independence. The visit has garnered mixed reactions, particularly in Quebec, but many see it as a significant show of support.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza resulted in the deaths of at least 52 people, including 36 in a school-turned-shelter, prompting renewed concerns over humanitarian aid. The Israeli military stated it targeted militants operating from within the school, while Hamas blamed the deaths on the strikes. U.N. officials have criticized the limited aid entering Gaza, with a new U.S.-backed aid distribution system facing rejection from aid groups due to concerns over independence and humanitarian principles.
