        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has revoked an extension of Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective September 1. This decision cancels a directive signed by former President Joe Biden that had extended her security detail for an additional year beyond the legally mandated six-month period following her departure from office. The move has drawn criticism from figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who described it as an act of political retaliation. This action is part of a broader pattern where the administration has also rescinded protection for other former officials and members of the Biden family.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has declared Gaza City a "dangerous combat zone," signaling the start of a planned major offensive and suspending humanitarian pauses in the area. This escalation comes as the bodies of two hostages, including Ilan Weiss, who was captured during the October 7, 2023 attack, were recovered from the enclave. The expansion of the war has faced international condemnation and sparked domestic protests from hostage families concerned about the safety of those still held by Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has affirmed his commitment to continuing military operations until all hostages are returned and Hamas is dismantled.</p>

          <p>According to the Department of Commerce, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, held steady in July with a 2.6% annual increase, matching the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, edged up slightly to 2.9% from 2.8% in June, its highest level since February. These figures suggest that inflationary pressures persist above the central bank's 2% target, reinforcing expectations that the Fed will proceed cautiously with any potential interest rate cuts.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has reported a nearly 30% drop in its second-quarter profits, earning $894.6 million despite a 14% rise in revenue. The company attributed the decline to an intense price war and aggressive marketing within China's increasingly competitive EV market, which has negatively impacted industry development. While domestic challenges have squeezed profits, BYD's overseas sales have surged dramatically, with international deliveries increasing by almost 145% year-on-year in the second quarter. The company's overall first-half earnings fell short of analyst expectations, highlighting the significant pressure from the domestic market.</p>

          <h2>Falling Condo Prices May Not Represent a True Bargain Due to Hidden Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the median price of condominiums in the U.S. has decreased by 2.1% year-over-year, they may not be the bargain they appear to be. An oversupply of condos, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, is driving prices down, but buyers face rising hidden costs that can offset the savings. These expenses include increasing HOA dues, higher insurance premiums, and new reserve requirements for building repairs, which are often factored into the lower sale prices.

While rates have already declined from their recent peaks, it is still possible to find CDs with rates around 4.50%. The article suggests considering online banks, which typically offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking a temporary restraining order to block his attempt to fire her from the central bank's board. Cook's lawyers argue the dismissal is "unprecedented and illegal," based on unsubstantiated allegations that she misrepresented her residency on past mortgage applications. The move is part of a broader effort by Trump to assert political control over the historically independent Federal Reserve, which has resisted his calls for interest rate cuts.

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 160 migrants, primarily from The Gambia and Senegal, has capsized off the coast of Mauritania, resulting in at least 49 deaths and around 100 people missing. The vessel was en route to Spain's Canary Islands when the accident occurred, with only 17 survivors rescued so far. Survivors reported that the boat capsized when passengers shifted to one side after spotting coastal lights. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers of the Atlantic migration route, which has seen a surge in traffic and thousands of fatalities in recent years.</p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June, exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%. The strong performance was driven by significant expansion in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some analysts point to a potential slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which isn't adjusted for inflation, fell compared to the previous quarter. The robust growth comes as the country faces economic headwinds, including new 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian imports that took effect this week, raising concerns about future economic performance.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, the storm is remembered as one of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The hurricane, which ultimately caused nearly 1,400 deaths, led to catastrophic flooding in New Orleans after the city's levee system failed, submerging at least 80% of the area. A slow federal response left thousands stranded for days in dire conditions at the Superdome and on highways. Two decades later, many communities, particularly the predominantly Black Lower Ninth Ward, have yet to fully recover from the devastation.</p>

          <p>Share prices for major UK banks, including NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays, fell sharply on Friday following a proposal for a new tax on banking profits. The left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggested a windfall tax could raise up to £8bn annually to compensate taxpayers for losses incurred from the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR argues that the current policy design results in a "government subsidy to commercial banks." While the Treasury has not commented, the proposal has sparked concern in the financial sector about potential new taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A complex chain of potential football transfers across the Premier League and Bundesliga is reportedly dependent on Liverpool submitting an improved bid for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. After Newcastle rejected an initial £110m offer, a new bid is expected to trigger a series of moves. Newcastle's imminent record signing of Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade is seen as the first step. The subsequent transfers could involve Brentford's Yoane Wissa moving to Newcastle and Borussia Dortmund's Max Beier joining Brentford, creating a domino effect that would ultimately facilitate Isak's desired move to Anfield before the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has signaled support for a 0.25% interest rate cut in September and indicated he would be open to a larger, half-point reduction if the labor market shows substantial weakening. In a recent speech, Waller expressed concern that labor conditions could deteriorate rapidly and argued the Fed should act preemptively rather than wait for a downturn to be underway. His comments come as revisions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest job creation has been weaker than initially reported, reinforcing his view that lower interest rates are necessary.

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested two wildland firefighters on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, alleging they were in the country illegally. The arrests occurred after the Bureau of Land Management requested identity checks for a 44-person contract crew, leading to the termination of contracts with two Oregon-based forestry companies. The incident drew sharp criticism from Senator Patty Murray, who called the Trump administration's immigration policy "fundamentally sick" and dangerous, particularly during wildfire season. Federal authorities stated the action did not interfere with firefighting operations, but critics argue it undermines public safety and stokes fear.</p>

          <p>The Cracker Barrel restaurant chain has faced a significant backlash from right-wing figures, including Donald Trump Jr., after updating its long-standing "Old Timer" logo as part of a brand modernization effort. Critics accused the company of becoming "woke" and abandoning its traditional American aesthetic, with some activists threatening to release damaging information about the company's internal policies. The controversy illustrates the intensity of the current culture wars, where corporate branding decisions can become targets for political outrage. Following the outcry, Cracker Barrel executives reportedly informed the White House they would restore the original logo.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming military parade will serve as a key indicator of the current standing of generals within the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as personnel changes are not regularly publicized. The prominence of certain officers in leading formations will signal who is favored by the top command, while the absence of others may suggest they have been affected by the ongoing anti-corruption campaign. This campaign has already resulted in the removal of at least 16 military deputies from the National People's Congress since early 2023. The event provides a rare glimpse into the opaque power dynamics of China's military leadership.</p>

It remains unclear whether the U.S. embassy will send a lower-level diplomat or a military attaché in the ambassador's place.

The recruitment drive has attracted a diverse range of applicants, from former law enforcement to naturalized citizens, drawn by patriotism, career stability, or a desire to enforce immigration laws.
