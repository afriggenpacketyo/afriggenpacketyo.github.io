          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides flood forecast data for approximately 60% of the U.S. population. This experimental tool offers real-time, interactive visualizations of current and predicted flooding, aiming to enhance the capabilities of forecasters and emergency responders. The expansion includes new coverage for the Great Plains, Southeast, Southwest, West Coast, Hawaii, and parts of Alaska. Officials state the tool has already proven effective in areas like Kentucky, where it aided in the timely evacuation of residents, and it is expected to be fully operational nationwide by next year.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman convicted in 2010 for the murder and arson that led to her husband Todd Stermer's death, is facing a new trial after her initial conviction was overturned. The case involves a bizarre series of events where Todd escaped their burning home only to be run over by Linda in their van. A federal judge overturned her life sentence in 2018, citing prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, a decision upheld by an appeals court. Despite maintaining her innocence, Stermer's sons believe she is guilty, and prosecutors have refiled murder charges, leading to a second trial.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Washington D.C. has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the deployment of the National Guard within the district is unconstitutional and illegal without the consent of local officials. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the move undermines the city's autonomy and is part of a harmful federal overreach. The deployment is part of President Trump's broader initiative to address crime in cities, though D.C.'s own data shows a significant decrease in violent crime this year. This legal challenge follows a similar ruling in California where a judge found the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to be illegal.</p>

          <p>During a heated Senate hearing, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense questioning from Democratic senators regarding his public statements and policies. Senator Tina Smith criticized his unsubstantiated suggestion that psychiatric drugs might be linked to school shootings, while Senator Bernie Sanders challenged his claims that major medical organizations are corrupted by the pharmaceutical industry. Kennedy also engaged in a fiery exchange with Senator Elizabeth Warren over his dismissal of the former CDC Director.

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte repeatedly refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a contentious interview, Pulte dismissed questions about the origin of the information, stating he would not reveal his sources or methods and arguing the focus should be on the alleged crime itself. The accusations have prompted President Trump to move to fire Cook, a move she is legally contesting. Pulte's aggressive social media campaign against Cook and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has raised concerns about the political weaponization of his agency.</p>

The Interior Department issued a sudden stop-work order for the nearly completed project, citing national security concerns, a justification Orsted calls a pretext for President Trump's well-known hostility towards wind power. The lawsuit argues the order is unlawful and was issued in bad faith, as the project has already passed extensive environmental and safety reviews.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.5%, marking its lowest point since October of the previous year. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, provides some relief to potential homebuyers by increasing their purchasing power. The downward trend in mortgage rates is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions heavily influence the bond market, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's broad definition of a farm includes any place that produces and sells, or could normally sell, $1,000 worth of agricultural products. This allows many small, non-commercial properties, hobby farms, and even land set aside for conservation to be counted, inflating the total number.

          <p>This article explores the idea of transforming anxiety from a debilitating condition into a catalyst for personal growth and adventure, drawing on the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. While acknowledging that anxiety disorders are serious medical issues, the author argues that moderate, managed anxiety is a natural human alarm system that can enhance performance and self-awareness. Research suggests that a moderate level of arousal can lead to optimal "flow" states, and transformative life experiences, though stressful, can foster a clearer sense of life's meaning. The article recommends accepting anxiety rather than suppressing it and reframing the physiological response as excitement for a new challenge.</p>

          <h2>Death Toll from Afghanistan Earthquake Rises to Over 2,200 as Rescue Efforts Continue</h2>

          <p>The death toll from a powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has climbed to at least 2,205, with another 3,640 people injured, according to the country's Taliban rulers. Rescue operations are ongoing but are hampered by the remote, mountainous terrain and roads blocked by landslides, forcing some aid workers to travel for miles on foot. Survivors are burying the dead in mass graves as hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands have been left homeless. The disaster exacerbates an already severe humanitarian crisis in the country, and international aid efforts are complicated by the lack of formal recognition for the Taliban government.</p>

          <h2>NBA to Introduce New Three-Team Tournament Format for 2026 All-Star Game</h2>

          <p>The NBA is planning to overhaul its All-Star Game format for the 2026 event in Los Angeles, moving to a round-robin tournament featuring three eight-player teams. The proposed structure would consist of two teams of U.S.-born players and one team of international players, a concept long favored by Commissioner Adam Silver to address the league's demographic imbalance. This change comes after widespread criticism of recent All-Star Games for their lack of defensive effort and competitiveness, particularly the 2024 game which ended with a 211-186 score. The new format aims to inject excitement and a higher level of play into the mid-season showcase.</p>

          <p>Neil Hopper, an NHS vascular surgeon from Cornwall, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Hopper, who had a sexual interest in amputation, used ice to intentionally freeze his own legs, leading to their medical amputation in 2019. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers by attributing the injuries to sepsis. The investigation also uncovered that he had purchased videos of body mutilation from a website run by Marius Gustavson. The case has prompted concern among some of Hopper's former patients, though a hospital trust review found no evidence of risk to patients.</p>

          <p>Following its second bankruptcy filing this year, budget carrier Spirit Airlines has announced it will end flight service in twelve U.S. cities, including Oakland, Portland, and Salt Lake City, effective October 2. The Florida-based airline is seeking to cut costs by eliminating unprofitable routes as it navigates a challenging financial period marked by rising operational costs and weak demand. In response to the service cuts, rival airlines such as United and Frontier quickly announced new routes to capture the market share being vacated by Spirit. The airline has stated it will contact affected passengers to provide refunds or other options.</p>

          <p>Eyewitnesses to the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon have described scenes of chaos and horror as one of the carriages sped uncontrollably down a steep hill before smashing into a building. The crash, which killed at least 16 people, occurred when the upper carriage apparently lost its brakes and derailed, while the lower carriage came to a sudden, violent stop. Witnesses reported hearing a loud screeching sound followed by what sounded like a bomb, with one describing the carriage collapsing "like a cardboard box." Local residents and tourists rushed to the scene to help before emergency services arrived, recounting the traumatic aftermath of the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>Robbers broke into the Adrien Dubouche National Museum in Limoges, France, and stole three priceless porcelain artifacts valued at approximately 9.5 million euros ($11 million). The thieves smashed a window to enter the museum in the early morning, making off with two Chinese porcelain dishes from the 14th and 15th centuries and an 18th-century Chinese vase. All three items are officially designated as "national treasures" of France. The city's mayor speculated that the heist was likely commissioned by high-level collectors, and prosecutors have opened an investigation into the theft of cultural property from a French museum.</p>

DraftKings CEO Jason Robins and BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt both reported strong pre-season numbers and expressed high optimism, noting no slowdown in consumer spending within the sector. The American Gaming Association projects that legal sports betting in the U.S. will grow by 8.5% to $30 billion this NFL season.

          <p>Two soldiers in Colombia sustained serious burn injuries after being doused with gasoline and set on fire by a group of civilians during an anti-drug mission. The attack occurred in the southeastern department of Putumayo as the military was attempting to destroy a cocaine laboratory. The army has accused the Comandos de Frontera, a dissident FARC guerrilla faction, of orchestrating the assault and coercing the local population to obstruct the operation. This incident highlights the escalating security crisis in remote, cartel-controlled regions of Colombia, where criminal groups involved in drug trafficking frequently clash with state security forces.</p>

German manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes, and VW are expected to debut new electric models, but they are grappling with job losses, rising costs, and shrinking market share in key markets like China.

          <p>The NFL season kicks off with several compelling questions, including whether the Green Bay Packers are now Super Bowl favorites after acquiring star defensive end Micah Parsons in a stunning trade from the Dallas Cowboys. Another major focus is the development of the six quarterbacks selected early in last year's draft, as they enter a critical second year where progress is not guaranteed. In the AFC, the central question remains whether any contender, such as the Buffalo Bills or Baltimore Ravens, can finally dethrone the Kansas City Chiefs, who have dominated the conference for the past six seasons under quarterback Patrick Mahomes.</p>
