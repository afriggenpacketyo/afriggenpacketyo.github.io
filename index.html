          <p>Activist groups are organizing nationwide "No Kings" protests in response to perceived abuses of power by the Trump administration, focusing on issues like immigration and the deployment of troops in cities. Organizers, backed by celebrity endorsements and significant advertising spending, anticipate millions of attendees across thousands of events. In response, Republican leaders have labeled the demonstrations as "hate America" rallies, while some governors have placed law enforcement on high alert, a move critics describe as an attempt to suppress dissent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new comedy "Good Fortune," written and directed by Aziz Ansari, offers a satirical take on wealth inequality through a story reminiscent of "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Trading Places." The film stars Ansari as a struggling gig worker who swaps lives with a wealthy tech capitalist, played by Seth Rogen, after an encounter with a guardian angel portrayed by Keanu Reeves. While the movie's humor is inconsistent, it effectively examines the disparity between the rich and the working class without demonizing wealth, ultimately delivering a heartfelt message.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in cities across the United States for the "No Kings" protests, a series of rallies challenging what organizers call the authoritarianism of the Trump administration. The events, which follow a similar large-scale mobilization in June, have prompted Republican governors in several states to place the National Guard on standby amid concerns from some politicians about potential unrest. Organizers maintain their goal is to peacefully protest against policies they deem chaotic and cruel, drawing solidarity from similar demonstrations in European cities.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds German Media Over-represents Foreigners in Crime Reporting</h2>

          <p>A new study from Macromedia University reveals a significant distortion in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned approximately three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. Journalism professor Thomas Hestermann, who led the research, noted this disparity has grown sharply since 2015 and influences public perception by creating a "migrantization" of crime. Criminologists argue that risk factors for crime are tied to poverty and lack of opportunity, not origin, suggesting that greater diversity within newsrooms could help correct this discriminatory reporting pattern.</p>

The research found that men were more inclined than women to move in together or marry sooner, often citing financial savings as a key motivator. Experts suggest this trend is also driven by the fact that romantic relationships often serve as the primary source of social and emotional support for heterosexual men, whose well-being can decline without such a partnership.</p>

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that its most important competition has been held outside of Japan. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in a specially constructed ring made from 11 tons of clay shipped from Japan. Organizers have worked to preserve the sport's deep cultural and religious traditions, which are rooted in the Shinto religion, while making it accessible to a Western audience with English commentary.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, a group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth offers a vital safe space for Black men to discuss their emotional well-being, a critical need given rising suicide rates in this demographic. Founded by Desmond Carter, the bi-monthly meetings allow men to be vulnerable and share their struggles without judgment, addressing pressures from systemic racism and societal expectations. The initiative serves as a gateway to therapy for many, aiming to break generational cycles and combat the stigma that often prevents Black men from seeking mental health support.</p>

          <p>The expression "Das crazy," a mix of German and English, has been chosen as Germany's Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The term, which originated in internet and meme culture, is used to express surprise or speechlessness and reflects the growing influence of English and a trend toward brevity in youth slang. Selected through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the phrase narrowly beat out "goonen," a term for excessive self-gratification, to capture the linguistic spirit of the younger generation.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, suggesting a link between early adoption and higher rates of teen anxiety and depression. To manage this, she recommends parents begin discussing responsible technology use with their children by late elementary school, years before they receive a device. Once a phone is introduced, Twenge stresses the importance of setting firm rules and using parental controls, such as banning phones from bedrooms overnight and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected device.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. Customs and Border Protection rule requires airlines to input either 'M' or 'F' for a traveler's sex, disregarding the 'X' gender marker available on U.S. passports since 2022. This has caused concern and confusion among non-binary and transgender travelers, who fear they may face difficulties or be denied boarding on international flights. While courts have affirmed the validity of 'X' marker passports, legal experts say the new rule could empower individual agents to act on personal bias and creates uncertainty for those whose documents reflect their gender identity.</p>

          <p>In explaining his investment strategy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards the first two, particularly gold, which he describes as a non-productive asset that generates no value on its own. Buffett argues that buying gold is merely a bet that someone else will be willing to pay more for it in the future due to fear, rather than an investment in its intrinsic ability to produce. Instead, he favors productive assets like farms and businesses, which are valued based on the output they can deliver over time. (not investment advice)</p>
