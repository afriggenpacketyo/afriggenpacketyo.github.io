In 2017, √Ålvarez's U.S. work visa was revoked due to alleged ties to a drug trafficker, but he regained it in 2025 after being removed from the sanctions list in 2022.</p>

          <p>A new report exposes the dark side of Myanmar's rare-earths mining boom, detailing how the exploitation of these minerals is causing significant environmental harm and endangering local villagers in the Kachin State. The in-situ leaching technique, involving the injection of chemicals into the earth to extract rare earth elements, is proving to be a major risk, with toxic leakage from ponds devastating the environment. Activists are calling for responsible mining practices and greater oversight to ensure that the benefits are shared with local populations and the environment is protected. Chinese imports of rare earth elements from Myanmar have skyrocketed, raising concerns about conflict financing in the region.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement continues to advocate for justice and equality, though many initial hopes for change remain unfulfilled, particularly in the U.S. President Donald Trump has rolled back programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in federal agencies, while police killings of Black people remain disproportionately high. Despite these setbacks, some positive changes include increased awareness of racism and bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver used in Floyd's death.
