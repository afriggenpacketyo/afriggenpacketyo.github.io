          <p>A man in Washington, D.C. is facing federal assault charges after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent during a verbal confrontation. According to court documents, the man shouted profanities at the officer before the incident, which occurred amid heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city. The deployment was authorized by President Trump, who cited a public safety emergency, a move contested by local officials who point to statistics showing a decrease in violent crime. The man reportedly admitted to the act after being apprehended.</p>

          <p>Several congressional Republicans have indicated they would support President Trump's effort to extend federal control over the Washington, D.C. police force, even if it means bypassing Congress. Trump recently invoked the Home Rule Act to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and has suggested he might use a national emergency declaration to prolong his authority. While obtaining a congressional extension could be difficult, key Republicans like Sen. Jim Banks and Sen. Mike Lee have voiced their backing for the president's actions to address crime in the nation's capital, setting up a potential conflict when lawmakers return.</p>

          <p>A man from upstate New York has been arrested and charged with cyberstalking for allegedly leaving a series of threatening voicemails for the widow of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, just hours after his murder. The suspect reportedly called the CEO a "capitalist pig" and used profanity-laced, sexist language in messages left on Paulette Thompson's work phone, terrifying a family already in mourning. Investigators traced the calls to the suspect's personal phone, and he was released with conditions including GPS monitoring. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison for the vicious and harassing conduct.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) inspector general reveals that all VA hospitals are experiencing "severe" staff shortages, with the number of deficiencies increasing by 50% this fiscal year. The watchdog found that 94% of facilities face a severe shortage of doctors and 79% lack enough nurses, with psychology being the most frequently reported staffing gap. These findings come as the VA is undergoing a department-wide reduction of 30,000 workers under the Trump administration. The VA's press secretary disputed the report's reliability, calling it "subjective" and "not standardized."</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by the end of the week. The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, is currently moving westward with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, early models suggest it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-normal hurricane season, with five to nine storms expected to reach hurricane strength.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen a dramatic increase in their franchise valuation, now estimated at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL behind the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a significant turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at just $930 million. The surge is largely attributed to their return to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium, a vision of owner Stan Kroenke. This valuation reflects the team's success in monetizing the venue and building strong fan and corporate bases in a major market. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, which used ancient DNA and computer models, found that North American caribou are at the highest risk, with their populations potentially plummeting by up to 80%. This decline is expected to have cascading ecological effects, including a reduction in tundra plant diversity and an exacerbation of climate warming through the release of soil carbon.

          <p>U.S. men's national team players Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, along with Pulisic's father, have strongly criticized former USMNT players for their negative commentary as pundits. In a new docuseries, Weah called the critics "evil," while Pulisic felt disrespected by those who questioned his commitment after he withdrew from the Gold Cup due to fatigue. Pulisic's father attributed the criticism to jealousy and a desire for clicks. The comments highlight a growing tension between the current generation of players and their predecessors who now work in media, particularly following the team's recent disappointing performances.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave dropped 20% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of 27 cents per share, compared to the 21 cents anticipated by analysts. The disappointing results were released just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more stock volatility. Despite the loss, the company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts, and it raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, some analysts expressed concern over a delay in capital expenditures, which could impact future revenue recognition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and dangerous Naegleria fowleri infection, commonly known as a brain-eating amoeba, in a patient who is now in intensive care. The infection may be linked to water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks, as the patient fell ill days after being at the lake. This type of infection occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose, allowing the amoeba to reach the brain. While the organism is common in warm freshwater, infections are extremely rare, with only 167 cases reported in the U.S. since 1962, but they are almost always fatal.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, while some of the market's largest tech companies saw a decline. This rotation is being driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowing for operations and expansion, and could also stimulate consumer spending. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, a sentiment fueled by recent economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's recent criticism of Goldman Sachs, a broad consensus is forming among Wall Street economists that increased tariffs will lead to higher consumer inflation later this year. Economists from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS predict that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, businesses will increasingly pass the higher costs onto consumers, potentially adding up to 1.5% to inflation. While this is not expected to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, it could dampen consumer spending and slow GDP growth in the near term, highlighting a significant economic headwind.

          <p>In a satirical piece, The Atlantic critiques the Trump administration's focus on rampant crime in Washington, D.C., by ironically agreeing with advisor Stephen Miller that he is surrounded by criminals. The article points not to street crime, but to individuals within the administration and its orbit, referencing figures involved in the January 6 mob, those who dismantled government departments, and the president himself, a convicted felon. It sardonically suggests the National Guard should focus on this internal "lawlessness" rather than on the broader city.
