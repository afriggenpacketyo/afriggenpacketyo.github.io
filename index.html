          <h2>UK Government Considers Mutual Ownership Model for Post Office</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 10:19:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing a potential shift to a mutual ownership model run by postmasters. This move comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongfully convicted, prompting calls for significant cultural and structural reform. The consultation will also explore the future services the Post Office should offer, particularly in banking, as the government aims to restore trust and ensure the organization's long-term stability. The government stated it does not plan to reduce the current network of 11,500 branches.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures, leading to evacuations and a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility. Firefighters are battling two blazes, the Dragon Bravo Fire and the White Sage Fire, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions, with tens of thousands of acres burned. The loss of the iconic lodge, a central feature for visitors since the 1930s, has been described as a significant blow to Arizona's history. Meanwhile, smoke from separate Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Dismiss Trump's Threat to Revoke Rosie O'Donnell's Citizenship</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 10:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following former President Trump's social media post suggesting he might revoke Rosie O'Donnell's US citizenship, legal experts have affirmed that such an action would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes birthright citizenship, and the president lacks the authority to strip it from a native-born American. This incident is the latest development in a nearly two-decade-long feud between the two public figures, recently reignited by O'Donnell's move to Ireland and her continued criticism of Trump's administration. O'Donnell has since responded defiantly to the threat on her own social media.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon victories of Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have generated controversy, as both singles champions previously served suspensions for banned substances. While authorities accepted that both cases resulted from unintentional contamination, the situation has prompted debate within the tennis community about fairness and the sport's image. Some players have expressed concern over what they perceive as inconsistent handling of doping cases, while others emphasize that the athletes were cleared of intentional wrongdoing. Sinner acknowledged the difficult period, stating the wins were "very special" after the stress of the past few months.</p>

          <p>The American woman who was sexually assaulted by Mark Gordon in 1989, when he was 14, has spoken out, describing him as a dangerous "psychopath" who should have been imprisoned for life. US court documents reveal the brutal details of the four-hour attack, for which Gordon was convicted and served 20 years in a Florida prison before being deported to the UK. Gordon and his partner, Constance Marten, were recently found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter in the death of their baby, Victoria. The jury in their initial trial was not informed of Gordon's prior conviction for sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flooding in Kerr County, Texas, were temporarily suspended due to a new flood threat. Heavy rains have caused the Guadalupe and San Saba Rivers to rise again, creating dangerous conditions for emergency crews in the same area where at least 132 people were killed. Officials have issued new flood warnings and are monitoring the situation closely, as the already saturated ground increases the risk of life-threatening flash floods.

          <p>A new Republican spending bill signed by President Trump is projected to cause a significant surge in electricity costs across the United States, with the largest impact felt in Republican-leaning states. The legislation eliminates key tax credits and support for cheaper renewable energy sources like solar and wind, forcing a greater reliance on more expensive fossil fuels. An analysis by Energy Innovation predicts that average household energy costs could rise by $170 annually by 2035, with states like Missouri and Kentucky facing increases of over $600. This outcome contrasts with Trump's campaign promise to lower energy costs for Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn a return that can outpace it, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some one-year CDs offering over 4.0% APY. The article advises savers to look at online banks, which have lower overhead, and to consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term ones. Building a CD ladder is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on these high short-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Storing money in a savings account is a wise strategy for building an emergency fund, but the interest earned can vary dramatically. While the national average savings rate is a meager 0.38%, high-yield savings accounts, primarily from online banks, are offering rates over 4.0%. The article explains that online banks can offer better rates due to lower overhead costs and often have no minimum balance requirements or monthly fees. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare different high-yield accounts to find the best combination of high interest rates and low fees for their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old inmate who escaped from a prison in Lyon, France, by hiding in a large bag carried out by a departing cellmate has been rearrested. The man was found and apprehended early Monday morning in a cellar in a nearby commune after a widespread investigation. The unusual escape, which was not discovered for 24 hours, has been described by a prison administration director as an "extremely rare event" that revealed "serious dysfunctions" at the facility. The accomplice who assisted in the escape has not yet been found by authorities.</p>

Over a decade, he grew the business by focusing on deep penetration in existing markets rather than rapid, wide expansion, ensuring product quality and high sales velocity. Now sold in 8,000 stores, Ithaca Hummus is projected to earn $50 million in revenue this year.</p>

          <p>In the wake of learning disruptions from the pandemic, some experts are proposing in-school 'brain training' programs to improve students' cognitive skills like working memory and attention. A recent German study suggested such a program improved children's focus, IQ, and long-term academic outcomes. However, other researchers urge caution, pointing to large-scale reviews and meta-analyses that found these programs have limited or no effect when implemented in real-world classrooms. Critics argue that these skills do not generalize well and that taking time away from core subjects like reading could be detrimental, especially for disadvantaged students.</p>
