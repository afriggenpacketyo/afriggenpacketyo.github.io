            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire for allegedly sharing classified details about a U.S. airstrike in Yemen with a private Signal group chat. Sources claim the chat included his wife, brother, and personal attorney, none of whom seemingly required such sensitive information. This incident follows a previous communication mishap where Hegseth inadvertently included a media executive in a similar chat. The Pentagon has not yet commented on these allegations, which raise serious concerns about the handling of classified military information by senior officials.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant with alleged ties to MS-13, was transferred from El Salvador's CECOT prison shortly before Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia to ensure his due process rights were being respected, drawing criticism from Republicans and praise from some Democrats. The White House and Trump supporters have argued Abrego Garcia is a dangerous gang member, while others claim he was wrongly deported. The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, but El Salvador's cooperation remains uncertain.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," non-sexual unions based on companionship and practical benefits, are gaining recognition. A growing number of couples are opting for these arrangements due to social security advantages and societal pressures to marry. One such couple, Satsuki and Minato, entered a friendship marriage after meeting online, eventually having a child through artificial insemination. While same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Japan, friendship marriages offer a way to navigate societal expectations and find partnership outside traditional norms.</p>

            <p>The fragile 30-hour "Easter truce" between Ukraine and Russia quickly dissolved, with both sides accusing the other of violations. Ukrainian President Zelensky reported nearly 3,000 alleged breaches by Russian troops, while Russia claimed to have repelled Ukrainian assaults. Amidst the continued fighting, former U.S. President Trump expressed optimism about a potential deal between the two nations within the week, though he provided no specific details. The conflict, ongoing since February 2022, has resulted in significant casualties and territorial control by Russia.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, keeping the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision reflects a focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst escalating trade tensions with the U.S., particularly after Trump's tariff impositions. Despite better-than-expected economic data, the PBOC's move signals a cautious approach to monetary policy in the face of external pressures. The steady rates align with economists' expectations and aim to support the yuan's value.</p>

            <p>South Korea's customs agency reported a surge in attempts to disguise foreign products, mainly from China, as Korean exports to bypass U.S. tariffs. The agency discovered 29.5 billion won worth of country-of-origin violations in the first quarter, with U.S.-bound shipments accounting for 97% of the total. This trend reflects efforts by foreign companies to exploit South Korea's free-trade agreement with the U.S. to avoid tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that Trump's escalating tariff war with the United States may ultimately make China stronger by forcing it to address its economic weaknesses. Instead of negotiating, China recognizes that the U.S.'s strategic goal is to hinder its economic growth. The article argues that China's fragmented domestic market is a key weakness that needs to be resolved. It points out that U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports to China are counterproductive, as China is a major buyer of U.S. chips.</p>

The rollout of 30 hours of free childcare per week for eligible working parents has not been a panacea, with increasing demand and a widening gap between those who qualify and those who don't. Private nurseries are also struggling with rising operating costs, leading some to consider withdrawing from the scheme.

Factors contributing to this include societal pressures to appear tough, concerns about being perceived as weak, appointment systems that don't accommodate work schedules, and a focus on treatment rather than prevention. Experts suggest that men are more likely to seek help when symptoms interfere with their daily lives. Support groups and redesigned services catering to men's needs could improve engagement.</p>

            <p>Scientists are investigating the Santorini volcano to assess the potential dangers of a future eruption. A team aboard the research ship Discovery is studying underwater vents and seismic activity to understand how seawater mixing with magma affects explosivity. The research aims to create geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency and inform residents about potential risks. The project is crucial given Santorini's reliance on tourism and the recent earthquake crisis, which highlighted the island's vulnerability.</p>
