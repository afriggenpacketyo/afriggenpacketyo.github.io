          <p>The Chinese government has sharply criticized Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for his recent remarks concerning Taiwan, warning Manila to cease "playing with fire." Marcos had stated that the Philippines could not remain neutral in a potential US-China conflict over Taiwan due to its geographical proximity. Beijing responded by accusing the Philippines of reneging on its commitments to the one-China principle and undermining regional stability. The exchange highlights the escalating diplomatic tensions in the South China Sea and the delicate geopolitical balance surrounding Taiwan's status.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to expand military operations, aiming to take control of Gaza City. The plan reportedly involves evacuating civilians to central and southern areas by October 7, followed by a siege and ground offensive against remaining Hamas militants. The decision has drawn criticism from families of Israeli hostages, who fear for their safety, and comes amid reports from the World Health Organization of unprecedented levels of child malnutrition in the besieged territory. The move marks a significant escalation in the 22-month conflict.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, has detailed China's ambition to build a "world-class" military by mid-century. The piece defines this goal as achieving top-tier global status and being able to dominate in military competition, explicitly using the United States' military as a benchmark. It stresses the need for advancements not just in weaponry and organization but also in military theory and talent development. This articulation provides a clearer view of China's long-term strategic objectives for its armed forces.</p>

          <p>Shares in SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high, marking their best performance in five years after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter profits. The Japanese investment giant posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst estimates and reversing a loss from the previous year. The strong results were driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, its largest since 2021. This was attributed to positive performance from portfolio companies like Grab Holdings and the anticipation of upcoming IPOs for others. (not investment advice)</p>

In one instance, a man was charged with disorderly conduct and indecent exposure for allegedly throwing toys at two separate games.

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, up from the previous $25 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the increase, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to bring fentanyl-laced cocaine into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020 during Trump's first term. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the move as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction from domestic issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed federal agencies to increase their law enforcement presence across Washington, D.C., to address a recent surge in violent crime.

This marks the fourth court decision to block the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions.

Researchers found that in some areas, like the Cascade Range, the season starts 46 days earlier. The primary drivers are not an increase in human-ignited fires but rather climate-related factors such as earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation due to rising temperatures. The findings provide concrete data supporting the anecdotal experience of Californians that wildfire has become a near-constant threat.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are experiencing fatigue with dating apps and are turning to old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy are hosting events that attract hundreds of people looking for genuine, face-to-face connections, free from the potential misrepresentation of online profiles. This trend aligns with data showing a decline in the popularity of dating apps and a 42% rise in attendance at singles events from 2022 to 2023. The shift reflects a craving for more authentic human interaction in the search for romantic relationships.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Americans derive an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The figure is even higher for young people aged 1 to 18, who get nearly 62% of their calories from these sources. The report defines ultra-processed foods as being energy-dense, low in fiber, and high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats. Common sources include sandwiches, sweet bakery products, and sweetened beverages, which have been linked in previous research to a higher risk of numerous chronic diseases.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. After claiming the celebrity chimp had died, Tonka was discovered alive in a small cage in her home. Animal rights group PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix, expressed relief at the sentencing, which they see as justice for the animal's suffering.</p>

          <p>Several dozen migrants who crossed the English Channel have been detained in the UK under a new pilot scheme with France. The "one-in, one-out" deal, which began this week, allows the UK to return a migrant who arrives by small boat in exchange for accepting an approved asylum seeker from France. The UK Home Office confirmed that detentions are underway and the first returns could happen within weeks. The 11-month pilot program is part of the Labour government's strategy to stop the small boat crossings and secure the country's borders.</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new "Map" feature, which can show a user's location to their friends, has triggered a significant backlash from users concerned about privacy. The tool is similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, and while Meta states the location-sharing function is opt-in by default, many users expressed fear and confusion, with some claiming their location was shared without their consent. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded, stating that the feature requires explicit, double consent to activate and that the company was investigating the claims to ensure no one's location is shared unintentionally.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss pill, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity lose a significant amount of weight in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with an efficacy and side effect profile similar to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. The most common side effects included nausea and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, which could make a more convenient and potentially cheaper pill-based option available by 2026.</p>

          <p>Democratic officials have strongly condemned a Texas Republican senator's claim that the FBI would help locate Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to block a GOP-led redistricting effort. The lawmakers fled to prevent a quorum, and the suggestion of using federal law enforcement to track political opponents has been labeled as authoritarian overreach. The FBI has not confirmed its involvement, and legal experts question the federal government's authority to intervene in such a state-level political matter. The controversy highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed second-quarter financial results, with revenues beating expectations but earnings per share falling short due to high beef prices. The company's revenue grew 12.8% to $1.51 billion, supported by a strong 5.8% increase in same-store sales driven by higher customer traffic. However, profitability was impacted by commodity inflation, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter. In response, the company plans a modest menu price increase to offset some of the rising costs while aiming to maintain its value proposition for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The weekend's schedule is also expected to be streamlined. These potential changes come after a number of artists canceled performances and staff resigned in response to the new leadership, and as the Center's development team has been significantly downsized.</p>
