          <h2>Study Reveals High-Dose Radiotherapy May Paradoxically Promote Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 01:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre has found that high doses of radiation therapy, commonly used to target and destroy cancer cells, can paradoxically promote the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly exposed to radiation. Led by biochemist Yang Kaiting, the research demonstrated that while radiotherapy effectively controls localized cancer tumors, it may also inadvertently stimulate distant metastasis, acting as a double-edged sword. This groundbreaking work highlights the complex and sometimes counterintuitive effects of cancer treatments, suggesting the need for more refined and targeted approaches. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has suspended free trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers in response to the ongoing conflict in Gaza and concerns over humanitarian aid access. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the Israeli government's policies in Gaza and the West Bank as "indefensible," citing the blockade of aid and expansion of the war. The UK is also sanctioning individuals, illegal settler outposts, and organizations supporting violence against the Palestinian community. This decision follows increasing pressure from allies, including France and Canada, who have also voiced concerns over Israel's actions and called for a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid. </p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has reportedly reached a tentative agreement with Republican lawmakers from blue states to increase the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 for households earning less than $500,000 per year. This proposal, intended for inclusion in President Trump's upcoming tax bill, aims to address concerns from Republicans representing high-cost-of-living areas who argue that failing to raise the SALT deduction could jeopardize the GOP's House majority in the 2026 midterms. However, the agreement faces potential opposition from GOP hardliners who are wary of incentivizing high-tax policies in blue states. </p>

          <p>Fujirebio Holdings, a Japanese company, will launch the first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the United States starting in late June, following FDA clearance. The test, designed for individuals 55 and older exhibiting signs of the disease, detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's. This non-invasive method, taking approximately 30 minutes from blood draw to diagnosis, is expected to be more accessible and less costly than specialized PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid tests. The availability of this blood test is considered a crucial step in facilitating the widespread use of new Alzheimer's treatments. </p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public criticism of his statement that he never buys rice because he receives it as gifts, a comment that resonated poorly amid rising rice prices. His resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings ahead of an Upper House election and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. The government has been attempting to curb soaring rice prices by releasing government stockpiles, but this has had little impact, and panic-driven hoarding has exacerbated the issue. Former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto. </p>

          <p>New satellite analysis reveals that the world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate last year, primarily due to fires, which surpassed land clearances from agriculture for the first time. This loss of old-growth forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. While South East Asia saw a decrease in forest loss due to government policies, researchers warn that some forests, like parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a "tipping point" of irreversible decline. The study underscores the urgent need for forest protection schemes and consistent policies to combat climate change. </p>

Trump has said the project will cost $175 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates it could cost between $161 billion and $542 billion.

Research indicates that young people generally hold more progressive values than previous generations, and the gender gap is primarily due to young women's increasing support for left-leaning policies and values. This shift presents a political opportunity for center-left parties, which should prioritize the values of female voters, such as climate action and a strong welfare state, rather than chasing an outdated interpretation of the "working-class" voter. This strategy could transform political discourse and encourage greater participation from young women in elections. </p>

          <p>Corey O’Connor, the son of a former mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voters’ dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O’Connor, the Allegheny County controller, will likely win the general election in November, as Pittsburgh has not had a Republican mayor since 1932. His victory halts the momentum that progressives had enjoyed in this Democratic stronghold. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would get the city working again while it tried to rebuild a tax base devastated by the pandemic downturn in commercial real estate. </p>

The family's recent announcement of Biden's aggressive prostate cancer is also questioned, with medical experts suggesting they likely knew about the condition long before, given the unparalleled medical check-ups a US president receives. </p>
