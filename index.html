          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks following Israel's strike on Iran's nuclear program, with the ceasefire expected to take effect early Tuesday. This announcement followed Iran's missile attack on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which caused no casualties, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran using "bunker busters." General Caine noted that a full battle damage assessment is still pending, even though Trump claimed that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran." The recent developments mark a period of heightened tensions in the Middle East. Optimism for long-term stability remains cautious given the complex history of the region. </p>

          <p>Ferrari faces unique pressure in Italy due to its status as a national team, leading to intense media scrutiny and public opinion regarding its performance. Team principal Frederic Vasseur expressed frustration with reports questioning his position, stating that such journalism hurts the team's morale and ability to compete for championships. These reports appeared in two respected Italian newspapers, Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere della Sera, highlighting the team's underperformance relative to pre-season expectations. Vasseur acknowledged the responsibility for the team's current situation lies with him, yet remains upset that his staff is being indirectly linked with other teams due to the reports. </p>

          <p>Global equities experienced muted gains as investors digested Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alongside growing signs of fatigue toward Trump's policymaking. The MSCI World index saw a slight increase, while U.S. futures also edged higher, with Asian equities showing similar trends. Hugh Dive from Atlas Funds Management suggested that the markets are becoming jaded by Trump's policy changes, especially after the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The market's reaction reflects a potential desensitization to America's policymaking after previous tariff-related volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trump ordered the U.S. military to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, despite the US intelligence community's long-held assessment that Iran has not built any atomic bombs. US intelligence agencies have maintained since 2007 that while Iran enriches uranium, it has not pursued weaponization, leading to ongoing debates with Israel and Iran hawks. Trump's willingness to listen to Israel over his own experts, combined with an ideological purge within the national security community, indicates a disregard for expert opinions. This situation is reminiscent of the lead-up to the Iraq War, where flawed intelligence led to miscalculations, raising concerns about the current administration's approach to Iran. </p>

Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, though Iran's foreign minister denied any such agreement. Japan is also experiencing a surge in whooping cough cases, with over 31,000 people infected this year, an eight-fold increase from 2024. Additionally, the U.S. has started imposing new tariffs on home appliance imports, while China plans to hold a military parade on Sept. 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. </p>

          <p>Western airlines face greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which is forcing carriers to avoid dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. While both Western and Chinese carriers are diverting flights, Western firms remain barred from Russian airspace, giving Chinese companies a competitive advantage. Analysts note that airfare and flight times are key factors for travelers, particularly from China, potentially widening the gap between Chinese airlines and their competitors. The closure of airspace over Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan has further complicated flight routes, with Western firms diverting through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, while Chinese airlines maintain more flexibility due to access to Russian airspace. </p>

The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes from firms with excessive market power. Google dominates the UK search market with over 90% of searches and supports 200,000 businesses through search advertising. Google stated it would "work constructively" with the CMA but acknowledged that the announcement presents "clear challenges" to its UK operations. </p>

Jim Gully, whose father was raised on the island, described an idyllic childhood spent exploring the white sand beaches and rocky coves. The castle on the island, built in 1911 by George Alexander MacLean Buckley, fell into ruin in the 1980s due to high upkeep costs. </p>

          <p>Taiwan's China Airlines is delaying the retirement of older aircraft due to delivery delays of Boeing 787-9 jets, which may lead to compensation payments from Boeing. The airline is undergoing a fleet renewal, splitting an order for new long-haul aircraft between Boeing and Airbus, including 24 Boeing 787s. Chairman George Kao stated that the delays are impacting the airline's plan to replace ageing Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s, and the airline will seek compensation from Boeing if the delays are Boeing's responsibility. The airline plans to add more capacity to routes like New York and London with the new fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany may face tax hikes and soaring debt to meet a higher NATO defense spending target of 5% of GDP, significantly increasing its annual defense expenditure. Currently, Germany spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, totaling over 90 billion euros, and increasing this to 5% would require tens of billions more each year. Experts suggest these additional expenses would likely be financed by loans, potentially leading to budget conflicts, funding cuts in other areas, and tax increases. Concerns also exist regarding the EU's fiscal rules, which could hinder Germany's ability to take on more debt, although temporary suspensions are possible under exceptional circumstances. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, offering a potential alternative to traditional electronic chips amid US sanctions. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to advanced Nvidia GPUs. As traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, optical computing offers advantages such as ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption. The development of "Meteor-1" signifies progress in overcoming challenges in optical computing by expanding computational parallelism. </p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, returning to levels below those seen before Israel's attack on Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, preventing any casualties. Analysts suggest that the market sell-off indicates investor belief that the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production is increasingly reliant on supplies from Myanmar, a country grappling with internal conflict.

This dependence has strengthened China's monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. However, the ongoing civil war in Myanmar poses supply chain risks, as armed groups have seized key mining sites, causing disruptions and price spikes. </p>
