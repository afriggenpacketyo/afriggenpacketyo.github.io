          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher as investors await a crucial US jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts in September. While global equities and bonds previously faced sell-offs due to government debt concerns, sentiment improved after payroll data supported rate cut bets without signaling a severe economic downturn. In corporate news, Danish wind farm developer Orsted lowered its full-year earnings guidance, citing lower offshore wind speeds and ongoing political obstructions to its US projects, leading to a lawsuit against the Trump administration. This article highlights the delicate balance between market optimism and underlying economic and corporate challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe is reportedly experiencing a period of significant geopolitical and economic distress, with some commentators likening it to a 'century of humiliation.' This sentiment stems from the perceived increasing pressure exerted by the United States and China on the continent. The article highlights concerns that Europe's 'summer from hell' is extending into autumn, marked by a sense of geopolitical subservience. This analysis underscores a growing anxiety within European circles regarding its standing and autonomy on the global stage amidst shifting power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra unexpectedly left Thailand, just hours before a parliamentary vote to select the country's next leader and ahead of a Supreme Court verdict that could lead to his imprisonment. His departure follows the recent removal of his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, from the premiership due to an ethics violation, signaling a decline in the powerful Shinawatra family's political influence. Construction magnate Anutin Charnvirakul is now the frontrunner for the prime minister position, gaining support from various opposition groups. This political turmoil underscores a period of significant uncertainty and shifting alliances within Thailand's government.</p>

His administration has introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), offering significant benefits to large-scale investors, with mining projects, particularly copper, attracting billions in commitments from companies like BHP and Glencore. Industry experts are hailing Argentina as a leading prospect for copper, comparing its potential to Western Australia's iron ore boom.

This move aligns with the US's long-standing effort to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with major companies already committing billions to build plants in the country.

The controversial facility, located on an abandoned airstrip, had faced legal challenges from environmental groups and a Native American tribe arguing for federal environmental reviews. The appeals court panel concluded that state and federal officials are likely to succeed in arguing the site is not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as it is state-operated and has not received federal reimbursement. This decision is a victory for the Trump administration and Governor Ron DeSantis, who advocate for increased immigration detention, but a setback for critics citing environmental and humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department is exploring a plan to deploy up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, a move requested by the Justice Department to alleviate a backlog of over 3.4 million immigration cases. This initiative follows the Trump administration's recent firings of immigration judges and loosened job requirements for these temporary roles, allowing a wider pool of government lawyers to preside over hearings. Critics, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association, have raised concerns about due process and the specialized nature of immigration law, arguing that military lawyers may lack the necessary expertise. The proposal highlights an unprecedented approach to addressing the overwhelmed immigration court system.</p>

Notably, the demand for AI skills is growing faster in non-tech sectors like marketing, finance, and HR than in traditional IT roles, driven by the increasing accessibility of tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. This trend suggests that AI literacy is becoming crucial across nearly all job functions, signaling a transformative shift in the labor market.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation in the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel. Prosecutors successfully argued that Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot after Markel opposed her daughter's desire to move their children away from Tallahassee following a bitter divorce. Adelson's son, Charles Adelson, and two other individuals are already serving life sentences for their roles in the crime. This verdict brings a measure of closure to a decade-long saga that has captivated Florida with its sordid details of family conflict and a tragic murder.</p>

          <p>A US bankruptcy attorney named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Facebook's parent company, Meta, claiming his account has been repeatedly disabled due to false accusations of 'impersonating a celebrity.' The lawyer, who has practiced for 38 years, asserts that these suspensions have caused thousands of dollars in lost business and a breach of contract, as he paid for advertising that was subsequently removed. Despite submitting multiple forms of identification, his account was only restored after the lawsuit was filed. Meta has acknowledged the error and stated it is taking steps to prevent future occurrences, highlighting a unique case of mistaken identity impacting an individual's professional life.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic published a critical article regarding President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the 'Department of War,' labeling the move as 'inane' and a form of 'political performance art.' The article argues that the original change to 'Defense' in 1947 reflected a mature understanding of national security in a post-WWII world, encompassing more than just active combat. It contends that the proposed renaming, driven by a desire to project a 'tougher' image, disregards historical context and the modern complexities of global security. The author points out that even major powers like China and Russia utilize 'Ministry of Defense' titles, suggesting Trump's rebranding is out of step with global norms.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's remote south-eastern region has been hit by a third earthquake in six days, a magnitude 5.6 tremor, adding to the devastation and fear in affected areas. The latest quake follows Sunday's catastrophic event, which has tragically killed 1,368 people and wounded 2,180, according to the UN. Rescue and disaster relief efforts are severely hampered by the region's rough, mountainous terrain, with landslides cutting off access to many remote villages. The Taliban government has appealed for international assistance, with the UN releasing emergency funds and the UK pledging aid. This series of seismic events underscores Afghanistan's vulnerability to earthquakes due to its geological location.</p>

The 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were dispatched in June amidst clashes between federal immigration agents and protesters. Newsom criticized the move as 'waste, fraud and abuse,' highlighting significant expenses for food, pay, and travel, alongside the negative impact on guardsmembers' readiness and well-being. The ruling by Judge Charles Breyer stated that the deployment violated federal law, likening it to creating a national police force under the president's command.</p>
